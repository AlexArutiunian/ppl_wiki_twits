He is the environment correspondent for The Nation, and the author of seven non-fiction books, including Earth Odyssey (1998) and Hot: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth (2011).[1]\nHe has covered climate change, politics, economics, the press, and music since 1989. His best-known work as an author is On Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan Presidency (1988), which described the way the Reagan White House \"deployed raw power and conventional wisdom to intimidate Washington's television newsrooms.\"[2] He has also written for magazines and newspapers such as The Guardian, Vanity Fair, Scientific American,Time, Harper\u2019s, and Le Monde.[3] He has been a commentator for the public radio programs Morning Edition, Marketplace, and Living on Earth, and taught writing at Johns Hopkins and the University of California, Berkeley.\u00a0Hertsgaard lives in San Francisco.\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nHertsgaard received a B.A. in international studies from Johns Hopkins University in 1977 and was one of the founders of the Baltimore City Paper. According to his fellow Johns Hopkins alumnus Russ Smith, he worked in the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C., after graduation.[4]\nWhile compiling a feature article for The New Yorker in 1993, Hertsgaard broke the news that the three surviving members of the Beatles were going to issue previously unreleased music from the group's career, as part of their multimedia Anthology project. In addition, they were reuniting to work on new recordings.[5] At this time, he was granted rare access to the band's EMI recording archives in London, gaining insight that informed his 1995 book A Day in the Life: The Music and Artistry of the Beatles.[5] Writing in 2000, Nick Bromell, professor of English at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and the founding editor of Boston Review, described A Day in the Life as \"the best single book on the music of the Beatles\".[6]\nDuring the 1990s, Hertsgaard's attention turned to the ecology of the Earth. He embarked upon a seven-year global tour to investigate the issue of environmental degradation. The journey spanned four continents, 19 countries and hundreds of interviews.[2] This resulted in the book Earth Odyssey: Around the World in Search of Our Environmental Future (1999), which was reviewed favorably in The New York Times Book Review and Time magazine.[7]\nHertsgaard also wrote about climate change adaptation in Hot: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth (2011), published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.[1] From 2011 to 2013, he was Schmidt Family Foundation Fellow at New America Foundation researching the linked challenges of climate change, food security, poverty, and ecological agriculture.\nIn May 2013 19 people were shot and wounded during a neighborhood Mother's Day second line parade in New Orleans. The attack took place at the corner of Frenchmen Street and North Villere in the city's 7th Ward, where hundreds of people had gathered near the French Quarter. Victims included 10 men, 7 women, a boy and a girl. Three people were seriously wounded. The Associated Press reported that three suspects were seen fleeing the scene. Police authorities classified it as part of the gun violence in the city.[8] Hertsgaard has written about being one of the victims.[9](subscription required)\n\nBibliography[edit]\nBravehearts: Whistle Blowing in the Age of Snowden (2016)\nHot: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth (2010)\nThe Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World (2002)\nEarth Odyssey: Around the World in Search of Our Environmental Future (1998)\nA Day in the Life: The Music and Artistry of the Beatles (1995)\nOn Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan Presidency (1988)\nNuclear Inc: The Men and Money (1983)\nNotes[edit]\n\n^ a b \"Mark Hertsgaard biography\".

    "wiki": "Mark Morford is a former columnist and culture critic for SFGATE. His opinion column was called Notes & Errata. His topics varied from sex and deviance to popular culture, technology, spirituality, music and politics.\n\n\nWriting career[edit]\nFrom 1999 to 2003, Morford wrote The Morning Fix, a newsletter for SFGATE,  which featured comments on news and current events, along with other personal, informal elements. The Fix began as a daily newsletter, then shifted to no more than three times a week, before being discontinued.\nMorford's online column was launched in 2000. It was added to the print edition of the Chronicle in 2005, where it ran in the Datebook (entertainment) section for three years in a slightly abbreviated form than the concurrent SFGATE version. The column was later pulled from the print edition in mid-2008 by the Chronicle's then-editor, Ward Bushee.\nIn 2001 Morford was suspended over a column on the sexual relationship between a teenage male student and an older female teacher, a column that was perceived as overly permissive. In 2003 he was suspended again for violating Chronicle language usage guidelines.[1]\nMorford gained publicity for his column \"Is Obama an Enlightened Being?\", published in June 2008 about then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, in which he wrote, \"Many spiritually advanced people I know (not coweringly religious, mind you, but deeply spiritual) identify Obama as a Lightworker, that rare kind of attuned being who has the ability to lead us not merely to new foreign policies or health care plans or whatnot, but who can actually help usher in a new way of being on the planet, of relating and connecting and engaging with this bizarre earthly experiment.\"[2] The column, and specifically the term \"Lightworker\", were mocked in publications including National Review,[3] The American Spectator[4] and SF Weekly.[5]\nMorford's writing has appeared in other publications, including Mother Jones, Sun Magazine, Bark and Yoga Journal. He also blogs for the Huffington Post.\n\nBooks[edit]\nMorford's first book, The Daring Spectacle: Adventures in Deviant Journalism, a compendium of his SFGATE columns, as well as various banned works and samples of hate mail from conservative detractors, was published in early 2010 by Rapture Machine, Inc.[6][7]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\nMorford has twice won first place in the online segment of the National Society of Newspaper Columnists' annual contest.[8][9][10] He has been nominated multiple times for GLAAD Media Awards for his columns in support of gay rights.[11][12][13]\n\nYoga and teaching[edit]\nSince 2000, along with his writing career, Morford has taught Vinyasa yoga classes in San Francisco, most recently at the Yoga Tree network of schools,[14][15] as well as private instruction. He is a certified, RYT 200 yoga teacher, according to Yoga Alliance guidelines.[16]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Fost, Dan (2001-03-28). \"3 Staffers Suspended Over SF Gate Column\".

Masih Alinejad wrote in her book that she started journalism with the help of Marjan Sheikholeslami.[17] She began her career in journalism in 2001 with the local daily Hambastegi, and then for the Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA). Other publications such as Shargh, Bahar, Vaghaye Ettefaghiye, Ham-Mihan, and Etemad, have also published her work. During the sixth and seventh parliament, Alinejad was a parliamentary reporter. In 2005, she wrote an article suggesting that government ministers had claimed they received pay cuts; they were actually receiving considerable sums of money as \"bonuses\" for everything from serving religious duties to ringing in the New Year. The article generated controversy, and led to her dismissal from parliament.[16]\nIn 2008, she wrote an exceptionally critical piece in Etemad, called \"Song of the Dolphins\", where she compared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's followers to hungry dolphins that make sounds and perform entertaining acts to grab a morsel of food from their trainer. Some supporters of President Ahmadinejad expressed their sense of outrage and offense, eventually forcing the director of the newspaper Mehdi Karroubi, himself a relatively popular and very powerful establishment politician and cleric, to publicly apologize.[18] In the summer of 2009, during her stay in the United States, Alinejad tried very hard to get an interview with Barack Obama; however, she was refused the interview, although she had been granted a temporary visa on that very basis. When her visa expired, she was forced to return to the United Kingdom. While in the United States, she participated in some Iranian anti-government protests, and delivered a speech in San Francisco, where she said, addressing the authorities of Iran, \"We have trembled for thirty years, now it is your turn to tremble.\" Her interview with Voice of America was shown together with parts of the videos she had made, called \"A Storm of Fresh Air\". In 2010, she and a group of Iranian writers and intellectuals established the \"IranNeda\" foundation. After the presidential election in Iran in 2009, she published a novel called A Green Date.[19][dubious  \u2013 discuss]\nAlinejad graduated from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in Communications Studies.[20]\n\nCareer[edit]\nOpposition to Iranian government[edit]\nAlinejad just after she left Iran for the United States in 2009\nIn 2014, Alinejad launched My Stealthy Freedom (also known as Stealthy Freedoms of Iranian Women), a Facebook page that invites Iranian women to post pictures of themselves without a hijab. The page quickly attracted international attention, and has garnered hundreds of thousands of likes.[21] In 2015, the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, awarded her its women's rights prize for \"giving a voice to the voiceless and stirring the conscience of humanity to support the struggle of Iranian women for basic human rights, freedom, and equality\".[22]\nOn June 13, 2022, she was awarded the American Jewish Committee's Moral Courage Award for speaking out fearlessly in support of the Iranian people being oppressed by the Iranian government.\nAlinejad has said she is not opposed to the hijab per se, but believes it should be a matter of personal choice. In Iran, women who appear in public without a hijab risk being arrested, imprisoned, and fined.[21]\n\nJournalism[edit]\nMasih Alinejad wrote in her book: \"Marjan Sheikholeslami, the head of the political department of Hambastegi newspaper agreed to take me under her wing.\"[17][23][24] Since 2015, Alinejad has hosted a weekly 15-minute primetime show called Tablet for Voice of America's Persian Language Service. \"With original video from inside Iran, Tablet profiles ordinary citizens and connects them with Americans through short interviews on common themes illustrating both similar and different experiences. The program also has a weekly \"timeline report\", tracing the development of issues such as the international women's rights movement and relations between Washington and Tehran\", the press release states.[25][26]\nIn July 2019, Iranian authorities warned the public that anyone sending videos to Alinejad faced up to 10 years in prison. Musa Ghazanfarabadi, the head of Tehran's Revolutionary Court, told Fars News that those sharing protest videos with Alinejad could be imprisoned for up to a decade under laws relating to cooperating with an enemy of the state.[27]\n\nAnti-compulsory hijab campaign[edit]\nMain article: My Stealthy Freedom\nAlinejad has been critical of the Islamic Republic of Iran's laws making it illegal for women not to wear a hijab outside the home,[28] but also making the broader point that in the current historical and political context \u2013 in previous decades it wasn't required or common in Iran and many other Muslim-majority countries \u2013 describing it as the most visible symbol of oppression,[29][30] Journalist Kim Ghattas has described Alinejad as \"spearheading\" the campaign against the mandatory veil in Iran even from her residence in Brooklyn.[31]\nSome feminists have supported Alinejad's campaign because, in their view, the Islamic veil is the most visible example of women's oppression in Muslim majority societies. However, postcolonial feminists criticized the campaign for invoking the old \"Orientalist cultural imagination\" in the West, which was based on stereotypes of oppressed women in the Orient who need to be liberated by adopting Western ideals. Islamic feminists, meanwhile, viewed this effort as bolstering the rising wave of Islamophobia in Europe and the United States, which portrays Islam as a misogynist religion.[32] Alinejad rejects accusations of Islamophobia while insisting that it is religious laws (Sharia) which scare her, and that it is that same religious fanaticism that is the primary cause of Islamophobia.[33] Speaking about hijab during a debate with Palestinian-American activist Linda Sarsour on CNN, Alinejad said: \"It's important if you care about human rights, women's rights, you cannot use the same tool which is the most visible symbol of oppression in the Middle East and say that this is a sign of resistance [in the United States].\"[34]\nAfter the Christchurch mosque shooting in March 2019 in New Zealand, Alinejad criticized New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern for wearing a hijab ostensibly in sympathy and respect to the Muslim victims. She said she \"felt that you are using one of the most visible symbols of oppression for Muslim women in many countries for solidarity, and it also broke my heart\".[35][36]\n\nChess championship boycott[edit]\nIn 2016, Alinejad launched a boycott campaign against the 2016 women's chess world championship, to be held in February 2017 in Tehran, Iran.[37] The campaign was incited by Naz\u00ed Paikidze, a Georgian-American chess player. Paikidze, a non-Iranian, refused to attend world championships in Tehran because according to Iran's religious law, female players would be forced to wear a hijab. Alinejad supported Paikidze, and co-wrote an op-ed with Indian-American Asra Nomani in The Washington Post.[38]\n\nMeeting with U.S. Secretary of State[edit]\nAlinejad with Mike Pompeo, 2019\nIn February 2019, Masih Alinejad met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.[39] US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Robert Palladino said Secretary of State \"thanked Ms. Alinejad for her bravery and continued dedication\".[40] Alinejad said they met for 35 minutes and she highlighted three areas. First, \"Many Iranians want an end to the Islamic Republic. Opposition voices should be heard\". Second, the international community should focus on 40 years of human rights violations by the regime, and third, the Trump administration travel ban hurts human rights activists and students, not the regime.[39]\n\nRecognition[edit]\nAwards[edit]\nAIB Media Excellence Award for Radio Farda's production \"Victims of 88\", Nov 2013[10]\nInaugural Women\u2019s Rights Award at the Geneva Summit, 2015[41]\nFreethinker Prize by Swiss Freethinkers Association, 2017[42]\nAmerica Abroad Media award, Nov 2019[43]\nMoral Courage Award by American Jewish Committee (AJC), Jun 2022[44]\nOxi Courage Award for her fight against Iran\u2019s compulsory hijab, Oct 2022[45]\nScholar-Statesman Award by Washington Institute for Near East Policy for her tireless promotion of women\u2019s rights, freedom, and political change in her native land, Nov 2022[46]\nGlobal Impact Award, Dec 2022[47]\nOther recognitions[edit]\nNominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for her advocacy for women's rights in Iran, 2022[48]\nNamed as one of the 12 Time Magazine's Women of the Year, March 2023[49][50]\nHarassment[edit]\nArrest and harassment of family members[edit]\nOn September 23, 2019, Islamic Republic security forces arrested three of Alinejad's family members as retribution for her women's rights activism, according to Amnesty International. Alinejad's brother, Alireza Alinejad, was arrested in Tehran, while Hadi and Leila Lotfi, brother and sister of her former husband, Max Lotfi, were all arrested in the northern city of Babol by officials from the ministry of intelligence.[51][52]\nHer parents, siblings, extended family and all relatives and associates who remained in their village, in northern Iran, were repeatedly harassed[citation needed], threatened with loss of employment, and instructed to lure Alinejad to neighboring Turkey for a \"family reunion,\" so that agents could supposedly \"just talk\" to her. Her brother warned her it was a trap. In 2018, Alinejad's sister and niece were forced to go on a prime-time television programme to say that the family was disgraced by Alinejad's behavior, and that their parents have disowned her.\nAlinejad responded that her family was forced to say such things by the authorities, a common tactic employed by the Iranian government aimed at discrediting dissidents.[53][54]\nShe wrote in a New York Times Op-ed published two weeks later: \"The truth is that before the show aired, I got a call from my mother \u2013 a tiny, illiterate woman who has the toughness that comes from being abandoned at an early age by her own mother and married off at 14 years old. She was sobbing. The intelligence service had tried to pressure her and my father to participate in the show. And the local Friday prayer leader had called them out in public and urged them to cooperate. She refused \u2013 a show of loyalty that I can never repay.\"[55] As did her brother Alireza, imprisoned after Intelligence agents raided his home and blindfolded and handcuffed him in front of his two small children, and dragged him away. He was sentenced to eight years, and remains in prison.[56]\n\nIranian government smear campaign[edit]\nBy this point, Iranian authorities had been conducting a concerted smear campaign against Alinejad for a decade. Even going to such extremes as doctoring photos to make it look like she engaged in sexually provocative behavior, and showing them to her elderly, poorly-educated father. She told The Guardian in 2013 that her father had refused to speak to her for three years as a result. Iranian state-run media have run numerous fabricated stories, such as her being an MI6 agent serving directly under then-Queen Elizabeth II, false quotes attributed to her saying such things as \"to be a journalist in Western countries, it is compulsory that you also work for the spy agencies\", that she is a drug addict, and that she was a victim of rape on the London subway.[56][57]\n\nKidnapping plot[edit]\nAlinejad meeting with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in July 2021\nIn July 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice claimed that four Iranian intelligence officials and a fifth assistant were planning to kidnap a New York-based journalist critical of Iran, as well as four further people in Canada and the UK. The Iranian kidnapping scheme\u2014which appears to be the first publicized case on U.S. soil\u2014dated back to at least June 2020. Robin Wright revealed in the New Yorker: \"According to the DOJ announcement, the plotters had identified travel routes from Alinejad's home to a Brooklyn waterfront, researched a service offering military-style speedboats for maritime evacuation out of New York, and studied sea travel from New York to Venezuela, which has close ties with the Islamic Republic. In a detailed e-mail, Kiya Sadeghi, another of the four indicted Iranian intelligence agents, even instructed the private investigators to take pictures of the envelopes in Alinejad's mailbox. The FBI stated that it had foiled Iran's scheme in the United States. \"Not on our watch,\" William Sweeney, the head of New York's FBI office, said.\"[56][58][14]\n\nAssassination plot[edit]\nOn July 28, 2022, a man named Khalid Mehdiyev approached Alinejad's residence in Brooklyn, looking inside the windows and attempting to open the front door. He was stopped later that day by New York City Police during a traffic stop. His license had been suspended and he was arrested for driving without one. The police found a suitcase in his car containing an AK-47 assault rifle with an obliterated serial number. The rifle, manufactured by Norinco, was loaded with a round in the chamber and a magazine attached, along with a second, separate magazine and approximately 66 rounds of ammunition. Mehdiyev, who is from Yonkers, waived his Miranda rights and told police that he was looking for an apartment. Mehdiyev, unprompted, volunteered that he did not know about a gun and claimed the suitcase was not his.[59] On August 11, 2022, Mehdiyev was indicted on one count of possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.[60] In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal, Alinejad quotes a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as saying, \"This time their objective was to kill you.\"[61] On January 27, 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging Mehdiyev and two other men in a plot to assassinate Alinejad.[62][63]\nIn 2023, Niloufar Bahadorifar was convicted for having willfully violated sanctions and knowingly provided financial support to Iranian intelligence assets, who in turn were engaged in a plot to kidnap Masih Alinejad.[64]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nAlinejad speaking at the PaykanArtCar unveiling in Oslo 2023, Simin Keramati is standing to her left\nAlinejad's memoir, The Wind in My Hair ISBN\u00a09780349008967, dealing with her journey from a tiny village in northern Iran to becoming a journalist and creating an online movement that sparked a nationwide protest movement, was published by Little Brown in 2018.[65] The New York Times wrote that the book paints a vivid portrait of modern Iran, saying that it was written with a \"blunt honesty\" that it considered to be a characteristic of Alinejad's life and writing.\nShe has published four books in Persian:\n\nTahasson[ISBN\u00a0missing] \u2013 which describes the political turmoil/challenges created when the \"Sixth Iranian Parliament\" went on strike.\nTaj-e-Khar (The Crown of Thorns)[ISBN\u00a0missing] \u2013 a novel that is now being translated into English. It refers to the passion of the Christ and the crown of thorns placed on his head by the Romans.\nI am Free[ISBN\u00a0missing] \u2013 which deals with women's issues in Iran, published in Germany because of its being blacklisted by the Islamic Culture and Guidance Ministry, Iran's censorship body.\nGharar Sabz (Green Rendezvous)[ISBN\u00a0missing] \u2013 which deals with post-2009 presidential election fraud violence. This book was also published in Germany, for the same reasons.\nSee also[edit]\nGuardianship of the Islamic Jurist\nIslamic Revolution\nIslamic Revolutionary Court\nTheocracy\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Weiser, Benjamin (July 13, 2021). \"Iranian Operatives Planned to Kidnap a Brooklyn Author, Prosecutors Say\".
