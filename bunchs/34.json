A winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, he is a regular CNN contributor and an op-ed columnist for The New York Times.\nBorn in Chicago, Kristof was raised in Yamhill, Oregon, the son of two professors at nearby Portland State University. After graduating from Harvard University, where he wrote for The Harvard Crimson, Kristof intermittently interned at The Oregonian. He joined the staff of The New York Times in 1984.\nKristof is a self-described progressive.[1] According to The Washington Post, Kristof \"rewrote opinion journalism\" with his emphasis on human rights abuses and social injustices, such as human trafficking and the Darfur conflict.[2] Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa described Kristof as an \"honorary African\" for shining a spotlight on neglected conflicts in the continent.[3]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nKristof was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up on a family sheep farm and cherry orchard in Yamhill, Oregon.[4] He is the son of Jane Kristof (n\u00e9e McWilliams) and Ladis \"Kris\" Kristof (born W\u0142adys\u0142aw Krzysztofowicz; 1918-2010), both long-time professors at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. His father was born to Polish and Armenian parents in the Chernivtsi, former Austria-Hungary, who immigrated to the United States after World War II.[5][6][7] Kristof graduated from Yamhill Carlton High School, where he was student body president and school newspaper editor. He attended Harvard College, where he was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate. At Harvard, he studied government, interned at Portland's The Oregonian, and worked on The Harvard Crimson newspaper. According to a profile of him, \"Alums recall Kristof as one of the brightest undergraduates on campus.\"[8]\nAfter Harvard, he studied law at Magdalen College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar. He earned his law degree with first-class honors and won an academic prize. He studied Arabic in Egypt for the 1983\u201384 academic year at The American University in Cairo.[9] He has a number of honorary degrees.\n\nCareer[edit]\nAfter joining The New York Times in 1984, initially covering economics, Kristof worked as a correspondent for the company in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Tokyo. He rose to be associate managing editor of The New York Times, responsible for Sunday editions. His columns have often focused on global health, poverty, and gender issues in the developing world. In particular, since 2004 he has written dozens of columns about Darfur and visited the area 11 times.\nKristof's biography says he has traveled to more than 150 countries.[10] Jeffrey Toobin of CNN and The New Yorker, a Harvard classmate, has said: \"I'm not surprised to see him emerge as the moral conscience of our generation of journalists. I am surprised to see him as the Indiana Jones of our generation of journalists.\"[11]\nBill Clinton said of Kristof in September 2009: \n\n\"There is no one in journalism, anywhere in the United States at least, who has done anything like the work he has done to figure out how poor people are actually living around the world, and what their potential is. So every American citizen who cares about this should be profoundly grateful that someone in our press establishment cares enough about this to haul himself all around the world to figure out what's going on. ... I am personally in his debt, as are we all.\"[12]\nKristof was a member of the board of overseers of Harvard University, where he was chief marshal of commencement for his 25th reunion. He is a member of the board of trustees of the Association of American Rhodes Scholars. Joyce Barnathan, president of the International Center for Journalists, said in a 2013 statement: \"Nick Kristof is the conscience of international journalism.\"[13]\nIn 2020, Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation described Kristof as \"journalism\u2019s North Star on issues of poverty, dignity and justice.\"[14]\nBetween 2010 and 2018 Kristof wrote three articles about Kevin Cooper, a man who had been sentenced to death for murdering a family in California. In these articles Kristof made the case that Cooper had been framed by a racist Sheriff's department and that the true killer was a white contract killer named Lee Furrow. After the third article, both U.S. Senators from California, Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein, called for a second round of DNA testing to clarify whether Cooper had been framed. Seven months after the article was published, departing Governor Jerry Brown authorized limited retesting to settle the issue; the testing is still ongoing.[as of?][15]\nOn November 12, 2016, Kristof made national headlines after he chased and tackled an intruder whom he discovered burglarizing his room at the Franklin Hotel near Independence Hall in Philadelphia.[16] In a blog post titled \"Why You Should Always Lock Your Hotel Room Door,\" published in The New York Times later that day, Kristof wrote that the thief threatened multiple times to stab him during the chase and was restrained in the lobby with the help of several hotel employees.[17]\n\nOregon gubernatorial campaign[edit]\nIn July 2021, survey research was conducted that appeared to be directed toward recruiting him or testing his potential appeal, as a candidate for governor of Oregon in 2022, as incumbent Kate Brown is term-limited.[18] In October 2021, Kristof left The New York Times after forming a political action committee for his potential candidacy, saying in a statement, \n\n\"Precisely because I have a great job, outstanding editors and the best readers, I may be an idiot to leave. But you all know how much I love Oregon, and how much I\u2019ve been seared by the suffering of old friends there. So I\u2019ve reluctantly concluded that I should try not only to expose problems but also see if I can fix them directly.\"[19][20]\nIn a twitter thread about Kristof\u2019s announcement, New York Times Features Editor Hillary Howard wrote, \"Nick had a remarkable talent for never taking anything personally, for never letting his ego get in the way. At a place as competitive as the Times, this trait really stood out. He somehow seemed like this innocent, unchanged after dining with warlords or interviewing pimps. This trait will serve him well, should he go into politics.\"[21] Other colleagues described Kristof as a mentor to young journalists.[22]\nOn October 27, 2021, Kristof officially announced he would run for governor as a Democrat.[23] A day later, on October 28, 2021, the Times published an essay by Kristof in which he wrote, \n\n\"I love journalism, but I also love my home state. I keep thinking of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s dictum: 'It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,' he said. 'The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena.'\"[24]\nOn January 6, 2022, Shemia Fagan, the Oregon Secretary of State, announced that Kristof was ineligible to run as he was judged not to have met the state's residency requirements.[25] Kristof challenged the decision in court and on February 17, the Oregon Supreme Court upheld the Secretary of State's ruling.[26]\nOn August\u00a01, 2022, Kristof and The New York Times announced that he would be returning to his  job as a columnist for the newspaper.[27] His first new column since returning to the paper was published on November 16, 2022.\n\nPrizes[edit]\nIn 1990, Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, won a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for their reporting on the pro-democracy student movement and the related Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.[28] They were the first married couple to win a Pulitzer for journalism. Kristof has also received the George Polk Award and an award from the Overseas Press Club for his reporting which focuses on human rights and environmental issues.\nKristof was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 2004 and again in 2005 \"for his powerful columns that portrayed suffering among the developing world's often forgotten people and stirred action.\" In 2006 Kristof won his second Pulitzer, the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary \"for his graphic, deeply reported columns that, at personal risk, focused attention on genocide in Darfur and that gave voice to the voiceless in other parts of the world.\" Kristof was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize again in 2012 and 2016; altogether, he has been a Pulitzer finalist seven times.\nIn 2008, Kristof received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[29][30]\nIn 2009, Kristof and WuDunn received the Dayton Literary Peace Prize's 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award.[31] Together, they also received the 2009 World of Children Lifetime Achievement Award.[32] He has also won the 2008 Anne Frank Award, the 2007 Fred Cuny Award for Prevention of Deadly Conflict, and the 2013 Advancing Global Health Award (from Seattle Biomed). Commentators have occasionally suggested Kristof for the Nobel Peace Prize, but when Media Web named Kristof its \"print journalist of the year\" in 2006 and asked him about that, it quoted him as saying: \"I can't imagine it going to a scribbler like me. That's a total flight of fancy.\"[33]\nIn 2011, Kristof was named one of seven \"Top American Leaders\" by the Harvard Kennedy School and The Washington Post. \"His writing has reshaped the field of opinion journalism,\" The Washington Post explained in granting the award.[2] That same year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.[34] Earlier, in 2007, U.S. News & World Report named Kristof one of \"America's Best Leaders.\"[35]\nIn 2013, Kristof was awarded the Goldsmith Award for Career Excellence in Journalism by Harvard University. Alex Jones, the Pulitzer Prize-winning director of Harvard Kennedy School of Government's Shorenstein Center, declared in presenting the award that \"the reporter who's done more than any other to change the world is Nick Kristof.\"[36] In the same year, Kristof was named an International Freedom Conductor by the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, largely for his work exposing human trafficking and linking it to modern slavery. The last person named to receive the title, two years earlier, was the Dalai Lama.[37]\nIn 2021, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded Kristof and The New York Times opinion video team an Emmy award for their video, \"Heartache in the Hot Zone: The Front Line Against Covid-19.\"[38]\n\nBooks[edit]\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Kristof and WuDunn on China Wakes, October 16, 1994, C-SPAN TimesTalks interview with Kristof and WuDunn on Half the Sky, September 15, 2009, C-SPAN Presentation by Kristof on A Path Appears, September 26, 2014, C-SPAN, After Words interview with Kristof and WuDunn on Tightrope, February 12, 2020, C-SPAN\nKristof has co-authored all his books with his wife WuDunn, include China Wakes: The Struggle for the Soul of a Rising Power (1994), Thunder from the East: Portrait of a Rising Asia (1999), Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide (Knopf, September 2009),[39] A Path Appears: Transforming Lives, Creating Opportunity (2014) and Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope (Knopf, January 2020). A feature documentary for Tightrope was released in 2019.[40] These were all bestsellers.\nKristof explained to Jane Wales of the World Affairs Council of Northern California that the idea for their book Half the Sky was sparked by the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. After covering the protests, which resulted in some 500 deaths, Kristof and WuDunn were shocked to learn that roughly 39,000 Chinese girls died each year because they were not given the same access to food and medical care as boys. WuDunn and Kristof did not find coverage of these deaths, although they were far more numerous than the casualties at Tiananmen Square. They decided to  dig deeper into questions of gender, Kristof said.[41] Half the Sky covers topics such as sex trafficking and forced prostitution, contemporary slavery, gender-based violence, and rape as a weapon of war and method of justice, as it highlights the multitude of ways women are oppressed and violated in the world.[39]\nHalf the Sky reached No. 1 on the best-seller lists. Carolyn See, an author and book critic of The Washington Post, said in her review: \n\n\"Half the Sky is a call to arms, a call for help, a call for contributions, but also a call for volunteers. It asks us to open our eyes to this enormous humanitarian issue. It does so with exquisitely crafted prose and sensationally interesting material. ... I really do think this is one of the most important books I have ever reviewed.\"[42]\nIn Cleveland, a reviewer for The Plain Dealer said: \"As Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring\" once catalyzed us to save our birds and be better stewards of our earth, 'Half the Sky' stands to become a classic, spurring us to spare impoverished women these terrors, and elevate them to turn around the future of their nations.\"[43] The Seattle Times review predicted that Half the Sky may \"ignite a grass-roots revolution like the one that eliminated slavery.\"[44]\n\nOpinion and stances[edit]\nIraq War[edit]\nKristof was opposed to the Iraq War and grew further opposed as time went on. In a column published on January 28, 2003, he summarized his position by writing, \"If we were confident that we could oust Saddam with minimal casualties and quickly establish a democratic Iraq, then that would be fine -- and such a happy scenario is conceivable. But it's a mistake to invade countries based on best-case scenarios.\"[45] He continued, \"Frankly, it seems a bad idea to sacrifice our troops' lives -- along with billions of dollars -- in a way that may add to our vulnerability.\"[46]\nKristof was criticized at the time for reporting that Iraqis opposed an American invasion. Andrew Sullivan was among Kristof's critics but in 2018, on the 15th anniversary of the war, apologized to Kristof in a tweet.[47]\nIn a column published on August 27, 2002, \"Wimps on Iraq,\" he wrote \"To us the existing Iraq debate seems largely beside the point; the real issue isn't whether we want to overthrow Saddam, but what price we would have to pay to get the job done.\"[45] He concludes, after detailing five practical concerns about invading Iraq, \"So if Mr. Bush were really addressing these concerns, weighing them and then concluding that on balance it's worth an invasion, I'd be reassured. But instead it looks as if the president, intoxicated by moral clarity, has decided that whatever the cost, whatever the risks, he will invade Iraq.\"[45] In the same column, he wrote, \"President Bush has convinced me that there is no philosophical reason we should not overthrow the Iraqi government, given that Iraqis themselves would be better off, along with the rest of the world. But Mr. Bush has not overcome some practical concerns about an invasion.\"[45]\nIn the column \"The Day After\" in September 2002, Kristof wrote, \"In one Shiite city after another, expect battles between rebels and army units, periodic calls for an Iranian-style theocracy, and perhaps a drift toward civil war. For the last few days, I've been traveling in these Shiite cities\u2014Karbala, Najaf and Basra\u2014and the tension in the bazaars is thicker than the dust behind the donkey carts. So before we rush into Iraq, we need to think through what we will do the morning after Saddam is toppled. Do we send in troops to try to seize the mortars and machine guns from the warring factions? Or do we run from civil war, and risk letting Iran cultivate its own puppet regime?\"[48]\nOn May 6, 2003, less than two months into the war, Kristof published the op-ed column \"Missing in Action: Truth\" in which he questioned whether the intelligence gathered by the Bush administration, which purportedly indicated that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, was either faked or manipulated. In this article, Kristof cited as his source a \"former ambassador\" who had traveled to Niger in early 2002 and reported to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the State Department that the uranium \"allegations were unequivocally wrong and based on forged documents.\" Kristof added, \"The envoy's debunking of the forgery was passed around the administration and seemed to be accepted\u2014except that President Bush and the State Department kept citing it anyway.\"[49]\nTwo months later, former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV came forward publicly and published a now-famous op-ed in The New York Times, \"What I Didn't Find in Africa.\"[50] This set off a series of events which resulted in what become known as \"Plamegate,\" the disclosure by the journalist Robert Novak of the until-then covert status as a CIA officer of Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame Wilson. A criminal investigation was launched as to the source of the leak, as a consequence of which I. Lewis (\"Scooter\") Libby, then-Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was indicted on obstruction of justice, false statement, and perjury charges and subsequently convicted and sentenced to 30\u00a0months in federal prison and a $250,000 fine though he never served time in prison because President Bush commuted his prison sentence. Kristof's May 6 article was mentioned in the federal indictment of Libby as a key point in time and a contributing factor that caused Libby to inquire about the identity of the \"envoy\" and later to divulge the secret identity of his wife to reporters.[51]\n\n\"Grand bargain\" with Iran[edit]\nKristof published several articles criticizing the missed opportunity of the \"grand bargain,\" a proposal by Iran to normalize relations with the United States, implement procedures to assure the US it will not develop nuclear weapons, deny any monetary support to Palestinian resistance groups until they agree to stop targeting civilians, support the Arab Peace Initiative, and ensure full transparency to assuage any US concerns. In return, the Iranians demanded abolition of sanctions and a US statement that Iran does not belong in the so-called \"Axis of Evil.\" In his columns, Kristof revealed the documents detailing the \"grand bargain\" proposal and argued that it was killed by hardliners in the Bush administration.\nAccording to Kristof, that was an \"appalling mistake\"[52] since \"the Iranian proposal was promising and certainly should have been followed up. It seems diplomatic mismanagement of the highest order for the Bush administration to have rejected that process out of hand, and now to be instead beating the drums of war and considering air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.\"[53] Kristof further believes that even if the grand bargain is not currently feasible, there is still an option for what he calls a \"mini-bargain,\" a more modest proposal for normalizing American-Iranian relations.[53]\n\nAnthrax attacks columns[edit]\nOn October 12, 2001, Times reporter Judith Miller became one of several victims of alleged anthrax attacks.[54][55] The book Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War, which Miller had co-written with two other Times staffers, had been published ten days earlier on October 2.[56] It became a top New York Times bestseller a few weeks later.[57] Its cover art depicted a white envelope like those used in the anthrax incidents. The text, written before the September 11 attacks, made reference to jihadist terrorists.[58]\nIn 2002, Kristof wrote a series of columns[59][60] indirectly suggesting that Steven Hatfill, a former U.S. Army germ-warfare researcher named as a \"person of interest\" by the FBI might be a \"likely culprit\"[61][62] in the anthrax attacks.[63][64] Hatfill was never charged with any crime. In July 2004, Hatfill sued the Times and Kristof for libel, claiming defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.[65] Subsequently, Hatfill voluntarily dismissed Kristof as a defendant in the case when it became clear that the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, lacked personal jurisdiction over Kristof. The suit continued against the Times itself but was dismissed in 2004 on the basis that allegations within Kristof's articles did not constitute defamation though they appeared untrue.\nThe appeals court reversed the lower court ruling in 2005, reinstating Hatfill's suit against the Times.[66] In January 2007, Presiding Judge Claude M. Hilton again dismissed the suit and ruled that Kristof's anthrax articles were \"cautiously worded\" and asserted that the scientist may perhaps be innocent.[67] Judge Hilton wrote that Kristof \"made efforts to avoid implicating his guilt\" and that \"Mr. Kristof reminded readers to assume plaintiff's innocence.\"[67] Kristof praised the dismissal of the suit, commenting that he was \"really pleased that the judge recognized the importance of this kind of reporting\" and that it was \"terrific to have a judgment that protects journalism at a time when the press has had a fair number of rulings against it.\"[67] After the case was dismissed in 2007, the dismissal was upheld by the Appeals Court. In 2008, the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to grant certiorari in the case and effectively left the Appeals Court decision in place. The basis for the dismissal was that Hatfill was a \"public figure\" and had not proved malice on the part of the Times.[68]\n\nSudan and Darfur[edit]\nKristof is particularly well known for his reporting on Sudan. At the beginning of 2004, he was among the first reporters to visit Darfur and describe \"the most vicious ethnic cleansing you've never heard of.\" He recounted what he called \"a campaign of murder, rape and pillage by Sudan\" and was among the first to call it genocide. His biography says that he has made 11 trips to the region, some illegally by sneaking in from Chad, and on at least one occasion, he was detained at a checkpoint when the authorities seized his interpreter and Kristof refused to leave him behind.\nKristof's reporting from Sudan has been both praised and criticized. Robert DeVecchi, past president of the International Rescue Committee, told the Council on Foreign Relations: \"Nicholas Kristof... had an unprecedented impact in single-handedly mobilizing world attention to this crisis. There are undoubtedly hundreds of thousands of refugees in and from the Darfur region who owe their very lives to this formidable humanitarian and journalist.\"[69] New York Magazine said that Kristof \"single-handedly focused the world's attention on Darfur,\"[70] and the Save Darfur Coalition said that \"he is the person most responsible for getting this issue into America's consciousness and the resulting efforts to resolve it.\"[71] Samantha Power, the author of A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, the Pulitzer Prize-winning book on genocide, told an American Jewish World Service audience that Kristof was probably the person the Janjaweed militia in Darfur most wanted to kill. In June 2008, the actress Mia Farrow spoke as Kristof was honored with the Anne Frank Award by declaring: \"Nick Kristof was one of the first to publicly insist that the words Never Again mean something for the people of Darfur. For his courage and his conviction in telling tell searing truths, he is the voice of our collective conscience, demanding we bear witness to the first genocide of the 21st century and encouraging us not to sit by while innocents die. Every once in a great while a moral giant appears among us. Nicholas Kristof is that person.\" For his coverage of Darfur, Ann Curry of NBC suggested that Kristof was \"the modern journalist who showed courage and leadership comparable to the great Edward R. Murrow.\"[72]\nOn the other hand, some commentators have criticized Kristof for focusing on atrocities by Arab militias in Darfur and downplaying atrocities by non-Arab militias. A book by Mahmood Mamdani of Columbia University, \"Saviors and Survivors,\" criticized Kristof's reporting for oversimplifying a complex historically-rooted conflict and packaging it as \"genocide.\" Others, including some critical of Sudan, have sometimes made similar arguments. The Sudanese government has also objected that Kristof's reporting exaggerates the scale of suffering and ignores the nuances of tribal conflicts in Darfur. The Sudan government and pro-government news media criticized him in March 2012 for sneaking into Sudan's Nuba Mountains region without a visa to report on hunger and bombings there by saying that his illegal entry was \"shameful and improper.\"[73]\n\nCriticism of anti-sweatshop movement[edit]\nNicholas Kristof argues that sweatshops are, if not a good thing, defensible as a way for workers to improve their lives and for impoverished countries to transform themselves into industrial economies. In his argument, sweatshops are an unpleasant but necessary stage in industrial development. Kristof is critical of the way \"well-meaning American university students regularly campaign against sweatshops\", particularly the anti-sweatshop movement's strategy of encouraging consumer boycotts against sweatshop-produced imports. Kristof and WuDunn counter that the sweatshop model is a primary reason that Taiwan and South Korea, which accepted sweatshops as the price of development, are today modern countries with low rates of infant mortality and high levels of education, but India, which has generally resisted sweatshops, suffers from a high rate of infant mortality.[74] Kristof and WuDunn admit that sweatshop labor is grueling and dangerous but argue that it is an improvement over most alternatives in extremely poor countries by providing much-needed jobs and boosting economies. They caution that anti-sweatshop boycott campaigns could lead to the closing down of manufacturing and processing plants in places like Africa, where they are needed most. \"This is not to praise sweatshops,\" they admit:\n\nSome managers are brutal in the way they house workers in firetraps, expose children to dangerous chemicals, deny bathroom breaks, demand sexual favors, force people to work double shifts or dismiss anyone who tries to organize a union. Agitation for improved safety conditions can be helpful, just as it was in 19th-century Europe. But Asian workers would be aghast at the idea of American consumers boycotting certain toys or clothing in protest. The simplest way to help the poorest Asians would be to buy more from sweatshops, not less.[75]\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict[edit]\nKristof supports Israeli and US negotiation with Hamas as a means to resolve the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He criticizes Israel for what he views as collective punishment of Gazans and holds that the lack of negotiations only strengthens extremists.[76] He also advocates removing Israeli settlements from Hebron since \"the financial cost is mind-boggling, and the diplomatic cost is greater.\" Kristof contrasts \"two Israels\": an oppressive security state in the Palestinian territories and a \"paragon of justice, decency, fairness \u2013 and peace,\" in the work of Israeli human rights activists, journalists, and jurists.[77]\n\nLibya[edit]\nDuring the 2011 Libyan civil war, Kristof remarked that the US should create a no-fly zone and also use military aircraft to jam Libyan state communications: \"let's remember the risks of inaction \u2013 and not psych ourselves out. For crying out loud!\"[78]\n\nUS government[edit]\nIn a column published in The New York Times on June 15, 2011, Kristof argued that the US military was a prime example of how a comprehensive social safety net, universal health care, a commitment to public service, low income disparity, and structured planning could be made to work within an organization. He then suggested that the military could serve as a model for improving American society along those lines.[79] That brought criticism from several other commentators, who argued that the military is effective at what it does only by severely limiting the freedom of its members. Jonah Goldberg argued, \"You've got to love how a system that requires total loyalty, curbs free speech, free association, freedom of movement, etc., is now either 'lefty' or 'liberal' because it gives 'free' healthcare and daycare,\" and he hinted that the ideas in Kristof's column resembled fascism.[80] David French added, \"If you want to see the military do what it does best, then ride out on a mission with an armored cavalry squadron. If you want to see the military struggle to do its job well, then I suggest you spend some time with its social services.\"[81]\n\nEducation reform[edit]\nIn a 2021 New York Times essay, Kristof wrote that he favors education reform more than teachers' unions do.[82] He wishes that unions would push more for higher pay and less for job security for weak teachers.[83] He suggests that unions sometimes encourage teachers to accept low wages in return for job security.[84] Instead, Kristof advocates that teachers give up some protections in exchange for receiving much higher average starting salaries. He says that despite his disagreements with unions on some issues, \"I roll my eyes\" at what he calls a conservative narrative that unions are the fundamental problem in K-12 education. States with the best schools, like Massachusetts, have strong teachers' unions, while those with the worst education outcomes, like South Carolina, have weak or non-existent unions, he wrote.\n\nFlame retardants and chemical reform[edit]\nKristof has written several articles on the controversial use of flame retardants in furniture,[85][86][87][88] most recently in the November 2013 piece \"Danger Lurks in that Mickey Mouse Couch.\" Kristof argues that legislative mandates of flame retardants in furniture are a result of powerfully-influential lobbyists representing the chemical industry. He claims that flame retardants are ineffective in saving lives but pose an increasingly evident public health risk to both families and firefighters. In his words, \"These flame retardants represent a dizzying corporate scandal. It's a story of corporate greed, deceit and skulduggery.\"[85]\nIn 2012, Kristof went as far as to write that flame retardants in furniture are \"a case study of everything that is wrong with money politics.\"[86] He concluded the article \"Are You Safe On That Sofa?\" by arguing that the United States needs not only safer couches but also a political system less distorted by what he calls \"toxic money.\"\nKristof's stances on flame retardants have come under fire from the chemical industry, which calls his opeds \"overdramatic\" and \"misleading.\"[89][90]\n\nChild pornography and nonconsensual pornography[edit]\nOn December 4, 2020, Kristof published a lengthy look at the website Pornhub and at its parent company, MindGeek.[91] Kristof examined how Pornhub routinely has pornographic content on its site involving minors, and he wrote about how Pornhub's reviewers often have to make judgment calls on whether the user-submitted pornographic videos feature underage performers and whether the videos depict individuals engaging in nonconsensual sex. Kristof's article included interviews with underage victims who have appeared in videos on Pornhub that were submitted by people who filmed them, in some cases while being raped, and he reported that several such victims had attempted suicide. Pornhub denied Kristof's claims by calling them \"irresponsible and flagrantly untrue.\"[92] Kristof implored leaders of Canada, where MindGeek is based, to consider why Canada hosts a website that profits off videos featuring rape and children.[91] In response, Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on December 4 told reporters outside his residence, \"We are always extremely concerned with gender-based violence, with exploitation of minors, with child pornography.\"[92]\nAfter MasterCard, Visa, and Discover banned payments to MindGeek-owned sites based on Kristof's report, several commentators argued that Kristof's solution impacted the many legal consensual sex workers who rely on MindGeek sites for income.[93] Sex Workers Outreach Project USA provided a statement on December 11, 2020 that asserted that \"the damage they do does not impact the labor as much as it affects the laborers who depend on the Pornhub platform to earn a living. Because of this decision, based on fiction and conflated reports regarding the presence of minors being assaulted on its platform, many sex workers will be forced even further into the margins.\"[94] Sarah T. Roberts described the campaign targeting Pornhub as \"strangely punitive and uniquely puritanical in an American way.\"[95]\nIn a follow-up article on April 16, 2021, \"Why Do We Let Corporations Profit From Rape Videos,\" Kristof provided an update and shared the story of a woman in Alberta who had been drugged and raped by her ex-husband, who later posted a video of the assault on Pornhub. The video was viewed by more than 200,000 people, and in her interview with Kristof, the woman shared she had attempted suicide. \"How do you get your head around 200,000 guys masturbating as you\u2019re being assaulted?\" she said.[96]\nKristof also addressed some of the concerns raised by pro-sex work activists that he was anti-pornography. He remarked that \"a starting point is to recognize that the issue is not pornography but child abuse and exploitation. We can be sex positive and exploitation negative.\"[96]\n\nPolitical party[edit]\nKristof is a self-described progressive and a registered member of the Democratic Party.[1] In 1974, a front-page article in the News-Register (McMinnville, Oregon) reported on Kristof's activism in Democratic politics throughout high school with the headline \"Nicholas Gets into Politics Early.\"[97] He has attributed many of his progressive views to his mother, Jane Kristof, who formerly served as treasurer of the Yamhill County Democratic Central Committee and currently serves as both her precinct committee-person and the coordinator of the Yamhill County Democratic Think Tank.[98][99] In 2011, President Barack Obama hosted Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, at the State Dinner for Hu Jintao.[100]\n\nWin-a-Trip with Nick Kristof contest[edit]\nIn 2006, The New York Times launched the Win a Trip with Nick Kristof contest, offering a college student the opportunity to win a reporting trip to Africa with Kristof by submitting essays outlining what they intend to accomplish in such a trip. From among 3,800\u00a0students who submitted entries, Kristof chose Casey Parks of Jackson, Mississippi. In September 2006, Kristof and Parks traveled to Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic and reported on AIDS, poverty, and maternal mortality. During the trip, Kristof published his New York Times columns while Parks wrote about her observations in her blog.\nThe success of this partnership prompted the Times to hold the Second Annual Win A Trip with Nick Kristof contest in 2007. Leana Wen, a medical student at Washington University in St. Louis, and Will Okun, a teacher at Westside Alternative High School in Chicago, were the winners of the 2007 competition.[101] During summer 2007, they traveled with Kristof to Rwanda, Burundi, and eastern Congo. Filmmaker Eric Daniel Metzgar joined Kristof, Wen and Okun on their trip. The resulting film, Reporter, premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival[102][103] and aired on HBO in February 2010.[104] In reviewing the film, which was executive produced by Ben Affleck, Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"In Reporter, he's a compelling figure, a cross between Mother Teresa and the James Woods character in Salvador, and what seals the intensity of his job is the danger.\"[105] The Washington Post observed, \"Ideally, [Kristof] hopes to teach his companions, who won a contest to travel with him, about the value of witnessing the world's atrocities and scintillating  [sic] them into stories that will call on people to act. Which is what Kristof did with his work in Darfur, Sudan: He caused people \u2013 from George Clooney on down \u2013 to do whatever they can.\"[104]\nSince 2010, the Center for Global Development has screened applicants for the contest, forwarding Kristof a short list of finalists for his selection.\nIn March 2018 Kristof traveled again to the Central African Republic accompanied by Tyler Pager, the former editor of The Daily Northwestern and the winner of that year's contest. The co-director of Columbia University's Human Rights Institute, Sarah Knuckey, described Kristof's reporting of the Central African Republic resulting from this trip as \"shallow\" and \"reckless\".[106]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nKristof married Sheryl WuDunn, a third-generation Chinese American, in 1988.[107] They have three children. In 2018, Kristof and his wife began converting his family's cherry orchard in Yamhill, Oregon, to a cider apple orchard and vineyard.[108] As of 2020[update], Kristof resides in Scarsdale, New York.[109]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of people from Oregon\nBibliography[edit]\nKristof, Nicholas D.; WuDunn, Sheryl (February 23, 2001).

    "wiki": "Journalism institution at Harvard University\nLogo of the Nieman Foundation\nThe Nieman Foundation for Journalism is the primary journalism institution at Harvard University.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nIt was founded in February 1938 as the result of a $1.4 million bequest by Agnes Wahl Nieman, the widow of Lucius W. Nieman, founder of The Milwaukee Journal. Scholarships were established for journalists with at least three years' experience to go back to college to advance their work.[1] She stated the goal was \"to promote and elevate the standards of journalism in the United States and educate persons deemed specially qualified for journalism.\"[2]\n\nPrograms[edit]\nNieman Fellows[edit]\nMain article: Nieman Fellowship\nThe Nieman Foundation is best known as home to the Nieman Fellows, a group of journalists from around the world who come to Harvard for a year of study. Many noted journalists, and from 1959, also photojournalists, have been Nieman Fellows, including John Carroll, Dexter Filkins, Susan Orlean, Robert Caro, Hodding Carter, Michael Kirk, Alex Jones, Anthony Lewis, Robert Maynard, Allister Sparks, Stanley Forman, Hedrick Smith, Lucia Annunziata, Jonathan Yardley, Philip Meyer, Howard Sochurek and Huy Duc. It is considered the most prestigious fellowship program for journalists; Nieman Fellows have collectively won 101 Pulitzer Prizes.[citation needed]\n\nNieman Reports[edit]\nThe foundation is also the home of Nieman Reports, a quarterly journal on journalism issues. The journal was founded in 1947.[3]\n\nNieman Watchdog[edit]\nIn 2004, the Foundation launched Nieman Watchdog, a website intended to encourage more aggressive questioning of the powerful by news organizations. In 2012 it became a project of Nieman Reports.[4]\n\nNieman Journalism Lab[edit]\nIn 2008, the foundation created the Nieman Journalism Lab, an effort to investigate future models that could support quality journalism.[5][6][7][8]\n\nNarrative journalism[edit]\nFor several years, ending in 2009, the foundation sponsored the annual Nieman Conference on Narrative Journalism,[9] the largest conference of its kind, which attracted hundreds of writers, filmmakers, and broadcasters to Boston. The narrative program now consists of a writing seminar for Fellows, and a public website, Nieman Storyboard,[10] which covers storytelling across media. \n\nAwards based at Nieman Foundation[edit]\nSeveral prestigious literary or journalism awards are based at the Nieman Foundation. They include three given in connection with the Columbia University School of Journalism:\n\nThe J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize ($10,000, \"recognizes superb examples of nonfiction writing that exemplify literary grace, a commitment to serious research and social concern\")\nThe Mark Lynton History Prize ($10,000, awarded to the \"book-length work of history, on any subject, that best combines intellectual or scholarly distinction with felicity of expression\")\nThe J. Anthony Lukas Work-in-Progress Award ($30,000, \"given annually to aid in the completion of a significant work of nonfiction\")\nOther awards based at Nieman include:\n\nThe Worth Bingham Prize for Investigative Reporting ($20,000, \"honors investigative reporting of stories of national significance where the public interest is being ill-served\")\nThe I.F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence (\"to a journalist whose work captures the spirit of independence, integrity, courage, and indefatigability that characterized I. F. Stone's Weekly\")\nThe Louis Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in Journalism (\"recognizes displays of conscience and integrity by individuals, groups or institutions in communications\")\nThe Taylor Family Award for Fairness in Newspapers ($10,000, \"recognizes fairness in newspaper reporting\")\nCurators[edit]\nThe leader of the Nieman Foundation is known as its \"curator\" \u2014 a holdover from a brief moment after Agnes Wahl Nieman's death when her gift was to be used to build a microfilm library of quality journalism. The foundation has appointed eight curators:\n\nArchibald MacLeish, 1938\u20131939\nLouis M. Lyons (Nieman Fellow class of 1939), 1939\u20131964\nDwight E.

Buchanan was an assistant and special consultant to U.S. presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan.[2] He is an influential figure in the modern paleoconservative movement in America.\nIn 1992 and 1996, he sought the Republican presidential nomination. In 1992 he ran against incumbent president George H. W. Bush, campaigning against Bush's breaking of his \"Read my lips: no new taxes\" pledge, as well as his foreign policy and positions on social issues. At the 1992 Republican National Convention, Buchanan delivered his \"Culture War\" speech in support of the nominated President Bush. In 1996, he ran against eventual Republican nominee Bob Dole, but withdrew after getting only 21 percent of Republican primary votes. In 2000, he was the Reform Party's presidential nominee. His campaign centered on non-interventionism in foreign affairs, opposition to illegal immigration, and opposition to the outsourcing of manufacturing from free trade. He selected educator and conservative activist Ezola Foster as his running-mate.\nIn 2002, he co-founded The American Conservative magazine and launched a foundation named The American Cause.[3] He has been published in The Occidental Observer, Human Events, National Review, The Nation, and Rolling Stone. The original host on CNN's Crossfire, he was a political commentator on the MSNBC cable network, including the show Morning Joe until February 2012, later appearing on Fox News. Buchanan was also a regular panelist on The McLaughlin Group.  Many of his views, particularly his opposition to American imperialism and the managerial state, echo those of the Old Right Republicans of the first half of the 20th century. Since 2006, Buchanan has been a frequent contributor to VDARE.[4][5]\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBuchanan was born in Washington, D.C., a son of William Baldwin Buchanan (August 13, 1905, in Virginia \u2013 January 19, 1988 in Washington, D.C.), a partner in an accounting firm, and his wife Catherine Elizabeth (Crum) Buchanan (December 23, 1911, in Charleroi, Washington County, Pennsylvania \u2013 September 18, 1995, in Oakton, Fairfax County, Virginia), a nurse and a homemaker.[6][7] Buchanan had six brothers (Brian, Henry, James, John, Thomas, and William Jr.) and two sisters (Kathleen Theresa and Angela Marie, nicknamed Bay). Bay served as U.S. Treasurer under Ronald Reagan. His father was of Irish, English, and Scottish ancestry, and his mother was of German descent.[6][8] He had a great-grandfather who fought in the American Civil War in the Confederate States Army, which is why he is a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.[9] He admires Robert E. Lee, Douglas MacArthur and Joseph McCarthy.[10]\nOf his Southern ancestry, Buchanan has written:[11]\n\nI have family roots in the South, in Mississippi. When the Civil War came, Cyrus Baldwin enlisted and did not survive Vicksburg. William Buchanan of Okolona, who would marry Baldwin's daughter, fought at Atlanta and was captured by General Sherman. William Baldwin Buchanan was the name given to my father and by him to my late brother.\nAs a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, I have been to their gatherings. I spoke at the 2001 SCV convention in Lafayette, LA. The Military Order of the Stars and Bars presented me with a battle flag and a wooden canteen like the ones my ancestors carried.[12]\nBuchanan was born into a Catholic family and attended Catholic schools, including the Jesuit-run Gonzaga College High School. As a student at a Catholic college\u2014Georgetown University\u2014he was in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) but did not complete the program. He earned his bachelor's degree in English from Georgetown, and received his draft notice after he graduated in 1960. The District of Columbia draft board exempted Buchanan from military service because of reactive arthritis, classifying him as 4-F. He received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in 1962, writing his thesis on the expanding trade between Canada and Cuba.[13]\n\nCareer[edit]\nSt. Louis Globe-Democrat editorial writer[edit]\nBuchanan joined the St. Louis Globe-Democrat at age 23. During the first year of the United States embargo against Cuba in 1961, Canada\u2013Cuba trade tripled. The Globe-Democrat published a rewrite of Buchanan's Columbia master's project under the eight-column banner \"Canada sells to Red Cuba \u2014 And Prospers\" eight weeks after Buchanan started at the paper. According to Buchanan's memoir Right from the Beginning, this article was a career milestone. Buchanan later said the embargo strengthened the communist regime and he turned against it.[14] Buchanan was promoted to assistant editorial page editor in 1964 and supported Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign. The Globe-Democrat did not endorse Goldwater, and Buchanan speculated there was a clandestine agreement between the paper and President Lyndon B. Johnson. Buchanan recalled: \"The conservative movement has always advanced from its defeats ... I can't think of a single conservative who was sorry about the Goldwater campaign.\"[10] According to the foreword (written by Pat Buchanan) in some editions of Goldwater's Conscience of a Conservative, Buchanan was a member of the Young Americans for Freedom and wrote press releases for that organization. He served as an executive assistant in the Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander, and Mitchell law offices in New York City in 1965.\n\nWork for the Nixon White House[edit]\nBuchanan on July 12, 1969\nThe next year, he was the first adviser hired by Nixon's presidential campaign;[15] he worked primarily as an opposition researcher. The highly partisan speeches Buchanan wrote were consciously aimed at Richard Nixon's dedicated supporters, for which his colleagues soon nicknamed him Mr. Inside.[16] Buchanan traveled with Nixon throughout the campaigns of 1966 and 1968. He made a tour of Western Europe, Africa and, in the immediate aftermath of the Six-Day War, the Middle East.\nDuring the course of Nixon's presidency, Buchanan became entrusted on press relations, policy positions, and political strategy.[17] Early on during Nixon's presidency, Buchanan worked as a White House assistant and speechwriter for Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew. Buchanan coined the phrase \"Silent Majority,\" and helped shape the strategy that drew millions of Democrats to Nixon. In a 1972 memo, he suggested the White House \"should move to re-capture the anti-Establishment tradition or theme in American politics.\"[18] His daily assignments included developing political strategy, publishing the President's Daily News Summary, and preparing briefing books for news conferences. He accompanied Nixon on his trip to China in 1972 and the summit in Moscow, Yalta and Minsk in 1974. He suggested that Nixon label Democratic opponent George McGovern an extremist and burn the White House tapes.[19] Buchanan later argued that Nixon would have survived the Watergate scandal with his reputation intact if he had burnt the tapes.[20]\nBuchanan remained as a special assistant to Nixon through the final days of the Watergate scandal. He was not accused of wrongdoing, though some mistakenly suspected him of being Deep Throat. In 2005 when the actual identity of the press leak was revealed as Federal Bureau of Investigation Associate Director Mark Felt, Buchanan called him \"sneaky,\" \"dishonest\" and \"criminal.\"[21] Because of his role in the Nixon campaign's \"attack group,\" Buchanan appeared before the Senate Watergate Committee on September 26, 1973. He told the panel: \"The mandate that the American people gave to this president and his administration cannot, and will not, be frustrated or repealed or overthrown as a consequence of the incumbent tragedy\".[19]\nWhen Nixon resigned in 1974, Buchanan briefly stayed on as special assistant under incoming President Gerald Ford. Chief of Staff Alexander Haig offered Buchanan his choice of three open ambassador posts, including South Africa, for which Buchanan opted. President Ford initially signed off on the appointment, but then rescinded it after it was prematurely reported in the Evans-Novak Political Report and caused controversy, especially among the U.S. diplomatic corps.[22]\nBuchanan remarked about Watergate: \"The lost opportunity to move against the political forces frustrating the expressed national will ... To effect a political counterrevolution in the capital\u2014\u00a0... there is no substitute for a principled and dedicated man of the Right in the Oval Office\".[19]\nLong after his resignation, Nixon called Buchanan a confidant and said he was neither a racist nor an antisemite nor a bigot or \"hater,\" but a \"decent, patriotic American.\" Nixon said Buchanan had \"some strong views,\" such as his \"isolationist\" foreign policy, with which he disagreed. While Nixon did not think Buchanan should become president, he said the commentator \"should be heard.\"[23][24] However, according to a memo President Nixon sent to John Ehrlichman in 1970, Nixon characterized Buchanan's attitude towards integration as \"segregation forever.\"[25] Following Nixon's re-election in 1972, Buchanan himself had written in a memo to Nixon suggesting he should not \"fritter away his present high support in the nation for an ill-advised governmental effort to forcibly integrate races.\"[26]\n\nNews commentator[edit]\nBuchanan returned to his column and began regular appearances as a broadcast host and political commentator. He co-hosted a three-hour daily radio show with liberal columnist Tom Braden called the Buchanan-Braden Program. He delivered daily commentaries on NBC radio from 1978 to 1984. Buchanan started his TV career as a regular on The McLaughlin Group and CNN's Crossfire (inspired by Buchanan-Braden) and The Capital Gang, making him nationally recognizable. His several stints on Crossfire occurred between 1982 and 1999; his sparring partners included Braden, Michael Kinsley, Geraldine Ferraro, and Bill Press.\nBuchanan was a regular panelist on The McLaughlin Group. He appeared most Sundays alongside John McLaughlin and the more liberal Newsweek journalist Eleanor Clift. His columns are syndicated nationally by Creators Syndicate.[27]\n\nWork for the Reagan White House[edit]\nBuchanan in 1985\nBuchanan served as White House Communications Director from February 1985 to March 1987.[28] In a speech to the National Religious Broadcasters in 1986, Buchanan said of the Reagan administration: \"Whether President Reagan has charted a new course that will set our compass for decades\u2014or whether history will see him as the conservative interruption in a process of inexorable national decline\u2014is yet to be determined\".[19]\nA year later, he remarked that \"the greatest vacuum in American politics is to the right of Ronald Reagan.\"[19] While her brother was working for Reagan, Bay Buchanan started a \"Buchanan for President\" movement in June 1986. She said the conservative movement needed a leader, but Buchanan was initially ambivalent.[19] After leaving the White House, he returned to his column and Crossfire. Out of respect for Jack Kemp he sat out the 1988 race, although Kemp later became his adversary.[18]\n\nPolitical campaigns[edit]\n1992 presidential primaries[edit]\nMain article: 1992 Republican Party presidential primaries\nLogo used for Buchanan's 1992 and 1996 campaigns\nBuchanan at the Florida State Capitol in 1992\nBuchanan was highly critical of the foreign and economic policies of the George H.W. Bush administration, particularly Bush's breaking of his 1988 \"Read my lips: no new taxes\" pledge.[29] In 1990, Buchanan published a newsletter called Patrick J. Buchanan: From the Right; it sent subscribers a bumper sticker reading: \"Read Our Lips! No new taxes.\"[30] In the 1992 Republican Party presidential primaries, Buchanan challenged Bush in his bid for re-nomination by the Republican Party, launching his campaign in December 1991.[31] Buchanan failed to win any primaries, but finished a strong second in the New Hampshire primary and was regarded as forcing Bush to walk back his economic policies.[29][32] The Buchanan campaign ran a number of radio and TV spots criticizing Bush's policies; in one, Buchanan accused Bush of being a \"trade wimp\", while another attacked him for presiding over the National Endowment of the Arts, which he said \"invested our tax dollars in pornographic and blasphemous art too shocking to show.\"[33]\nIn 1992, Buchanan explained his reasons for challenging the incumbent, President George H. W. Bush:\n\nIf the country wants to go in a liberal direction, if the country wants to go in the direction of [Democrats] George Mitchell and Tom Foley, it doesn't bother me as long as I've made the best case I can. What I can't stand are the back-room deals. They're all in on it, the insider game, the establishment game\u2014this is what we're running against.[10]\nHe ran on a platform of immigration reduction and social conservatism, including opposition to multiculturalism, abortion, and gay rights. Buchanan challenged Bush (whose popularity was waning) when he won 38% of the New Hampshire primary. In the primary elections, Buchanan garnered three million total votes or 23% of the vote.\nBuchanan later threw his support behind Bush and delivered an address at the 1992 Republican National Convention, which became known as the culture war speech, in which he described \"a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America.\"[34] In the speech, he said of Bill and Hillary Clinton:\n\nThe agenda Clinton & Clinton would impose on America\u2014abortion on demand, a litmus test for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat units\u2014that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America needs. It is not the kind of change America wants. And it is not the kind of change we can abide in a nation we still call God's country.[35]\nBuchanan also said, in reference to the then recently held 1992 Democratic National Convention, \"Like many of you last month, I watched that giant masquerade ball at Madison Square Garden\u2014where 20,000 radicals and liberals came dressed up as moderates and centrists\u2014in the greatest single exhibition of cross-dressing in American political history.\"[36]\nThe contents of Buchanan's speech prompted his detractors to claim that the speech alienated moderate voters from the Bush-Quayle ticket.[37] The newspaper columnist Molly Ivins wrote: \"Many people did not care for Pat Buchanan's speech; it probably sounded better in the original German.\"[38]\n\nOff the campaign trail[edit]\nBuchanan returned to his column and Crossfire. To promote the principles of federalism, traditional values, and anti-intervention, he founded The American Cause, a conservative educational foundation, in 1993. Bay Buchanan serves as the Vienna, VA-based foundation's president and Pat is its chairman.[39]\nBuchanan returned to radio as host of Buchanan and Company, a three-hour talk show for Mutual Broadcasting System on July 5, 1993. It pitted him against liberal co-hosts, including Barry Lynn, Bob Beckel, and Chris Matthews, in a time slot opposite Rush Limbaugh's show. To launch his 1996 campaign, Buchanan left the program on March 20, 1995.\n\n1996 presidential primaries[edit]\nMain article: Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1996\nBuchanan made another attempt to win the Republican nomination in the 1996 primaries. Democratic President Bill Clinton was seeking reelection, but Clinton's predecessor President George H.W. Bush made clear he was uninterested in regaining the office. The party's front-runner was Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Majority Leader, who was considered to have many weaknesses.[citation needed]\nBuchanan contested the Republican nomination from Dole's right, voicing his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Other candidates for the nomination included Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander and multi-millionaire publisher Steve Forbes.\nIn February, the liberal Center for Public Integrity issued a report claiming Buchanan's presidential campaign co-chairman, Larry Pratt, appeared at two meetings organized by white supremacist and militia leaders. Pratt denied any tie to racism, calling the report an orchestrated smear before the New Hampshire primary. Buchanan told the conservative Manchester Union Leader he believed Pratt. Pratt took a leave of absence \"to answer these charges,\" \"so as not to have distraction in the campaign.\"[40]\nBuchanan defeated Dole by about 3,000 votes, bettering his 1992 second-place finish in the February New Hampshire primary. He was endorsed by conservative Phyllis Schlafly, among others. He won three other states (Alaska, Missouri, and Louisiana), and finished only slightly behind Dole in the Iowa caucus. His insurgent campaign used his soaring rhetoric to mobilize grass-roots right wing opinion against what he saw as the bland Washington establishment (personified by Dole) which he believed had controlled the party for years. At a rally later in Nashua, he said:\n\nWe shocked them in Alaska. Stunned them in Louisiana. Stunned them in Iowa. They are in a terminal panic. They hear the shouts of the peasants from over the hill. All the knights and barons will be riding into the castle pulling up the drawbridge in a minute. All the peasants are coming with pitchforks. We're going to take this over the top.[41]\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Buchanan on The Great Betrayal, May 17, 1998, C-SPAN\nIn the Super Tuesday primaries Dole defeated Buchanan by large margins. Having collected only 21%, or 3.1 million, of the total votes in Republican primaries, Buchanan suspended his campaign in March. He declared that, if Dole were to choose a pro-choice running mate, he would run as the US Taxpayers Party (now Constitution Party) candidate.[42] Dole chose Jack Kemp, and he received Buchanan's endorsement. After the 1996 campaign, Buchanan returned to his column and Crossfire. He also began a series of books with 1998's The Great Betrayal.\n\n2000 presidential campaign[edit]\nMain articles: Reform Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000 and Pat Buchanan presidential campaign, 2000\n\nBuchanan announced his departure from the Republican Party in October 1999, disparaging them (along with the Democrats) as a \"beltway party.\" He sought the nomination of the Reform Party. Many reformers backed Iowa physicist John Hagelin, whose platform was based on Transcendental Meditation. Party founder Ross Perot did not endorse either candidate for the Reform Party's nomination. (In late October 2000, Perot publicly endorsed George W. Bush, but Perot's 1996 running-mate, Pat Choate, would go on to endorse Buchanan.)\nSupporters of Hagelin charged the results of the party's open primary, which favored Buchanan by a wide margin, were \"tainted.\" The Reform Party divisions led to dual conventions being held simultaneously in separate areas of the Long Beach Convention Center complex. Both conventions' delegates ignored the primary ballots and voted to nominate their presidential candidates from the floor, similar to the Democratic and Republican conventions. One convention nominated Buchanan while the other backed Hagelin, with each camp claiming to be the legitimate Reform Party.\nUltimately, when the Federal Elections Commission ruled Buchanan was to receive ballot status as the Reform candidate, as well as about $12.6 million in federal campaign funds secured by Perot's showing in the 1996 election, Buchanan won the nomination. In his acceptance speech, Buchanan proposed US withdrawal from the United Nations and expelling the United Nations Headquarters from New York, abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Housing and Urban Development, taxes on inheritance and capital gains, and affirmative action programs.\nAs his running mate, Buchanan chose African American activist and retired teacher from Los Angeles, Ezola B. Foster. Buchanan was supported in this election run by future Socialist Party USA presidential candidate Brian Moore, who said in 2008 he supported Buchanan in 2000 because \"he was for fair trade over free trade. He had some progressive positions that I thought would be helpful to the common man.\"[43] On August 19, the New York Right to Life Party, in convention, chose Buchanan as their nominee, with 90% of the districts voting for him.[44]\nIn a campaign speech at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, Buchanan attempted to rally his conservative base:\n\nGod and the Ten Commandments have all been expelled from the public schools. Christmas carols are out. Christmas holidays are out. The latest decision of the United States Supreme Court said that children in stadiums or young people in high school games are not to speak an inspirational moment for fear they may mention God's name, and offend an atheist in the grandstand ...\nWe may not succeed, but I believe we need a new fighting conservative traditionalist party in America. I believe, and I hope that one day we can take America back. That is why we are building this Gideon's army and heading for Armageddon, to do battle for the Lord.[45]\nIn the 2000 presidential election, Buchanan finished fourth with 449,895 votes, 0.4% of the popular vote. (Hagelin garnered 0.1% as the Natural Law Party candidate.) In Palm Beach County, Florida, Buchanan received 3,407 votes\u2014which some saw as inconsistent with Palm Beach County's liberal leanings, its large Jewish population and his showing in the rest of the state. As a result of the county's now-infamous \"butterfly ballot\", he is suspected to have gained close to 3000 inadvertent votes. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer stated, \"Palm Beach county is a Pat Buchanan stronghold and that's why Pat Buchanan received 3,407 votes there.\" Reform Party officials strongly disagreed, estimating the number of supporters in the county at between 400 and 500. Appearing on The Today Show, Buchanan said: \"When I took one look at that ballot on Election Night ... it's very easy for me to see how someone could have voted for me in the belief they voted for Al Gore\".[46]\nSome observers said his campaign was aimed to spread his message beyond his white conservative and populist base, while his views had not changed.[47]\n\nLater presidential elections[edit]\nFollowing the 2000 election, Reform Party members urged Buchanan to take an active role within the party. Buchanan declined, though he did attend their 2001 convention. In the next few years, he identified himself as a political independent, choosing not to align himself with what he viewed as the neo-conservative Republican party leadership. Prior to the 2004 election, Buchanan announced he once again identified himself as a Republican, declared that he had no interest in ever running for president again, and reluctantly endorsed Bush's 2004 reelection, writing: \"Bush is right on taxes, judges, sovereignty, and values. Kerry is right on nothing\".[48]\nBuchanan also endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012, stating in an article that \"Obama offers more of the stalemate America has gone through for the past two years\" while \"Romney alone offers a possibility of hope and change.\"[49]\nBuchanan supported the nomination of Donald Trump, who ran on many of the same positions that Buchanan ran on twenty years prior, as Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.[50][51]\n\nLater media activities[edit]\nMSNBC commentator[edit]\nBuchanan being interviewed in 2008\nAlthough CNN decided not to take him back, Buchanan's column resumed.[52] A longer variation of the Crossfire format was aired by MSNBC as Buchanan and Press on July 15, 2002, reuniting Buchanan and Press. Billed as \"the smartest hour on television\", Buchanan and Press featured the duo interviewing guests and sparring about the top news stories. As the Iraq War loomed, Buchanan and Press toned down their rivalry, as they both opposed the invasion.[53] Press claims they were the first cable hosts to discuss the planned attack.[54] MSNBC Editor-in-Chief Jerry Nachman once jokingly lamented this unusual situation:\n\nSo the point is why does only Fox [News Channel] get this? At least, we work at the perfect place, the place that's fiercely independent. We try to have balance by putting you two guys together and then this Stockholm syndrome love fest set in between the two of you, and we no longer even have robust debate.[55]\nJust hours after his talk show debuted, Buchanan was a guest on the premiere of MSNBC's short-lived Donahue program. Host Phil Donahue and Buchanan debated the separation of church and state. Buchanan called Donahue \"dictatorial\"[56] and said that the host got his job through affirmative action.[57]\nMSNBC President Eric Sorenson canceled Buchanan and Press on November 26, 2003.[53] Buchanan stayed at MSNBC as a political analyst. He regularly appeared on the network's talk shows. He occasionally filled in on the nightly show Scarborough Country during its run on MSNBC. Buchanan also was a frequent guest and co-host of Morning Joe as well as Hardball and The Rachel Maddow Show.\nIn September 2009, Buchanan wrote an MSNBC opinion column arguing that Adolf Hitler did not want war and the Allied force's actions were unnecessary. The article was removed from the website after MSNBC was urged to do so in a public statement by the National Jewish Democratic Council.[58] Buchanan had used the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the German invasion of Poland to argue that the United Kingdom should not have declared war on Nazi Germany.[59][60] This revived charges of antisemitism and helping to legitimize Holocaust denial.\nIn October 2011, Buchanan was indefinitely suspended from MSNBC as a contributor after the publication of his book Suicide of a Superpower. One of the book's chapters is titled, \"The End of White America.\"[61] The minority advocacy group Color of Change had urged MSNBC to fire him over alleged racist slurs.[62] It was announced on February 16, 2012, that MSNBC's connection with Buchanan had ended.[63]\n\nThe American Conservative magazine[edit]\nMain article: The American Conservative\nIn 2002, Buchanan partnered with former New York Post editorial page editor Scott McConnell and journalist Taki Theodoracopulos to found The American Conservative, a new magazine intended to promote traditional conservative viewpoints on economic, immigration and foreign policies. The first issue was dated October 7, 2002.\n\nVDARE[edit]\nSince 2006, Buchanan has been a frequent contributor to VDARE, a far right website and blog founded by anti-immigration activist and paleo-conservative Peter Brimelow. VDARE is considered a white nationalist news source by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[4][5]\n\nControversies[edit]\nAntisemitism allegations[edit]\nIn December 1991, a 40,000-word article by William F. Buckley Jr. was published in the National Review discussing antisemitism among conservative commentators focused largely on Buchanan; the article and many responses to it were collected in the book In Search of Anti-Semitism (1992). He wrote: \"I find it impossible to defend Pat Buchanan against the charge that what he did and said during the period under examination amounted to anti-Semitism\",[64][65] but concluded: \"If you ask, do I think Pat Buchanan is an anti-Semite, my answer is he is not one. But I think he's said some anti-Semitic things\".[66]\nThe Anti-Defamation League has described Buchanan as an \"unrepentant bigot\" who \"repeatedly demonizes Jews and minorities and openly affiliates with white supremacists.\"[67] In an article for The Washington Post in March 1992, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer suggested: \"The real problem with Buchanan ... is not that his instincts are antisemitic but that they are, in various and distinct ways, fascistic.\"[68] \"There's no doubt,\" said Krauthammer in 1999 when contacted for a Salon article, \"he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice.\" He added: \"The interesting thing is how he can say these things and still be considered a national figure.\"[26] Buchanan denies assertions that he is an antisemite, and some of his fellow journalists, including Murray Rothbard,[69] Jack Germond, Al Hunt and Mark Shields, have defended him against the charge.[70]\n\nNazi war criminals[edit]\nAround 1982,[71] Buchanan began to defend Cleveland auto-worker John Demjanjuk against the charge that Demjanjuk was a Nazi war criminal nicknamed \"Ivan the Terrible\" responsible for the mass murder of Jews at Treblinka. In 1986, while he was a senior figure in the Reagan administration, he was highly critical of the charges brought by Office of Special Investigations (OSI), the Nazi war crimes unit of the Justice Department. He claimed Demjanjuk was the victim of mistaken identity and possibly the victim of a deliberate frame-up by the Soviet Union.[72]\nThe following year, while still a member of the administration, he made unofficial attempts to stop the deportation of suspected Nazi war criminals from the Eastern Bloc, including Estonian Karl Linnas as well as Demjanjuk.[73] Menachem Z. Rosensaft, in a New York Times op-ed, described Buchanan's \"oft-expressed sympathy for a host of Nazi criminals\" like Linnas as being \"a constitutionally protected perversion.\"[74] Buchanan referred to such cases as being pursued by \"revenge-obsessed Nazi hunters\" in 1987.[75] As a member of the Reagan White House, he was accused of having suppressed the Reagan Justice Department's investigation into Nazi scientists brought to America by the OSS's Operation Paperclip.[76]\nIn 1990, Allan Ryan Jr., a former head of the OSI said Buchanan's accusation of KGB involvement in the Demjanjuk case was \"an absolutely cockamamie theory.\" Ryan accused Buchanan of being \"the spokesman for Nazi war criminals in America.\" Neal Sher, OSI head in 1990 said Buchanan had never contacted them, even when he was a government official. \"He essentially took what was fed him by our opponents, sometimes Holocaust-deniers, and just regurgitated it,\" Sher told The Washington Post.[71] In 1993, however, the Supreme Court of Israel overturned Demjanjuk's war crimes conviction and sentence of death by hanging as a miscarriage of justice based on mistaken identity. Demjanjuk then returned to the United States to fight the revocation of his American citizenship.[77]\nFollowing an elderly Demjanjuk's re-arrest and extradition to the Federal Republic of Germany in 2009,[78] Menachem Z. Rosensaft in The Times of Israel and Jeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic, objected to an outraged Buchanan again accusing the case of being a frame-up and comparing Demjanjuk to Jesus Christ and calling him an \"American Dreyfuss. [sic]\" This was alleged by Goldberg as an example of the libel that the Jews as a whole killed Christ.[79][80] Describing Buchanan's comparison as \"strikingly offensive\" and an attempt to \"revive the charge of blood libel\" against Jews, Peter Wehner wrote in Commentary magazine: \"Rarely do you find such an obscene mix of blasphemy and bigotry, and all in less than 900 words.\"[81] Demjanjuk was later convicted of being an accessory to murder of 28,000 Jewish prisoners at the Sobibor extermination camp. Demjanjuk died in 2012, while the verdict had been overturned and was pending appeal.[82]\n\nBitburg visit by President Reagan[edit]\nBuchanan supported President Reagan's plan to visit a German military cemetery at Bitburg in 1985, where among buried Wehrmacht soldiers were the graves of 48 Waffen SS members. At the insistence of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and over the vocal objections of Jewish groups, the trip went ahead.[83] In a 1992 interview, Elie Wiesel described attending a White House meeting of Jewish leaders about the trip: \"The only one really defending the trip was Pat Buchanan, saying, 'We cannot give the perception of the President being subjected to Jewish pressure.'\"[84] Buchanan accused Wiesel of fabricating the story in an ABC interview in 1992: \"I didn't say it and Elie Wiesel wasn't even in the meeting ... That meeting was held three weeks before the Bitburg summit was held. If I had said that, it would have been out of there within hours and on the news.\"[85]\n\nComments on the Holocaust[edit]\nIn a 1990 column for the New York Post, Buchanan wrote that it was impossible for 850,000 Jews to be killed by diesel exhaust fed into the gas chamber at Treblinka in a return to his interest in the Demjanjuk case. \"Diesel engines do not emit enough carbon monoxide to kill anybody,\" he wrote. The Washington Post cited experts to the effect that there is more than sufficient carbon monoxide present in the fumes to speedily asphyxiate victims, causing their death.[71][86] Buchanan once argued Treblinka \"was not a death camp but a transit camp used as a 'pass-through point' for prisoners\". In fact, historians have estimated that some 900,000 Jews were murdered at Treblinka.[87] When George Will challenged him on the issue on TV in December 1991, Buchanan did not reply.[64]\n\nComments about Israel[edit]\nIn the context of the Gulf War, on August 26, 1990, Buchanan appeared on The McLaughlin Group and said: \"there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East \u2013 the Israeli defense ministry and its 'amen corner' in the United States.\" Buchanan on The McLaughlin Group on June 15, 1990, asserted: \"Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory\".[88] He also said in the August 1990 program: \"The Israelis want this war desperately because they want the United States to destroy the Iraqi war machine. They want us to finish them off. They don't care about our relations with the Arab world.\"[89] A. M. Rosenthal, in an article for The New York Times explicitly accused Buchanan of antisemitism on the grounds that he had used the word \"Israelis\" as a cover for Jews.[90] Abraham Foxman, the director of the ADL, compared Buchanan's comments to insinuations made during the Second World War \"that Jews were the only ones who sought American entry in the war against Nazi Germany\".[89]\nHolocaust survivor Elie Wiesel in September 1990 said Buchanan \"leaves the memory of Jewish victims in such disdain; a man who always takes the side of those accused of being killers; a man who is constantly criticizing Israel; a man who always has something nasty to say about the Jewish people\".[71]\n\nCentral Park jogger case[edit]\nIn a 1989 column, Buchanan called for the public hanging in Central Park of a 16-year-old black teenager and the horsewhipping of four other younger African American and Hispanic teenagers for allegedly raping a white jogger in the Central Park Five case.[91] He also called for the civilizing of \"barbarians\" by putting the \"fear of death\" in them. Robert C. Smith, professor of political science at San Francisco State University, characterized the column as racist.[92][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The five teenagers were convicted, but their charges were later withdrawn, when in 2002 a man said he acted alone and DNA testing affirmed his guilt.[91]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBuchanan's wife Shelley in 1996\nBuchanan married White House staffer Shelley Ann Scarney in 1971.[93] They had a tabby cat named Gipper, who reportedly sat on Buchanan's lap during staff meetings.[94] Buchanan identifies as a traditionalist Catholic who attends Mass in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite,[95] and strongly defended Summorum Pontificum.[96]\n\nElectoral history[edit]\nMain article: Electoral history of Pat Buchanan\nPublications[edit]\nExternal videos \"A Firing Line Debate: Resolved: That the Senate Should Ratify the Proposed Panama Canal Treaties.\" Firing Line with William F.

He retired from Princeton in June 2015, and holds the title of professor emeritus there. He also holds the title of Centennial Professor at the London School of Economics.[10] Krugman was President of the Eastern Economic Association in 2010,[11] and is among the most influential economists in the world.[12] He is known in academia for his work on international economics (including trade theory and international finance),[13][14] economic geography, liquidity traps, and currency crises.\nKrugman is the author or editor of 27 books, including scholarly works, textbooks, and books for a more general audience, and has published over 200 scholarly articles in professional journals and edited volumes.[15] He has also written several hundred columns on economic and political issues for The New York Times, Fortune and Slate. A 2011 survey of economics professors named him their favorite living economist under the age of 60.[16] According to the Open Syllabus Project, Krugman is the second most frequently cited author on college syllabi for economics courses.[17] As a commentator, Krugman has written on a wide range of economic issues including income distribution, taxation, macroeconomics, and international economics. Krugman considers himself a modern liberal, referring to his books, his blog on The New York Times, and his 2007 book The Conscience of a Liberal.[18] His popular commentary has attracted widespread praise and criticism.[19]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nPaul Krugman, Roger Tsien, Martin Chalfie, Osamu Shimomura, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Masukawa, Nobel Prize Laureates 2008, at a press conference at the Swedish Academy of Science in Stockholm.\nKrugman was born to a Ukrainian Jewish family,[20][21] the son of Anita and David Krugman. In 1914, his maternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from Ukraine,[22] while in 1920, his paternal grandparents arrived from Belarus.[23][24] He was born in Albany, New York, spent several years of his childhood in the upstate city of Utica,[25] before growing up from age eight in Merrick, a hamlet in Nassau County, Long Island. [26] He graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore.[27] According to Krugman, his interest in economics began with Isaac Asimov's Foundation novels, in which the social scientists of the future use a new science of \"psychohistory\" to try to save civilization. Since present-day science fell far short of \"psychohistory\", Krugman turned to economics as the next best thing.[28][29]\nIn 1974, Krugman earned his BA[30] summa cum laude in economics from Yale University, where he was a National Merit Scholar. He then went on to pursue a PhD in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  In 1977, he successfully completed his PhD in three years, with a thesis titled Essays on flexible exchange rates.[31] While at MIT, he was part of a small group of MIT students sent to work for the Central Bank of Portugal for three months in the summer of 1976, during the chaotic aftermath of the Carnation Revolution.[32]\nKrugman later praised his PhD thesis advisor, Rudi Dornbusch, as \"one of the great economics teachers of all time\" and said that he \"had the knack of inspiring students to pick up his enthusiasm and technique, but find their own paths\".[33] In 1978, Krugman presented a number of ideas to Dornbusch, who flagged as interesting the idea of a monopolistically competitive trade model. Encouraged, Krugman worked on it and later wrote, \"[I] knew within a few hours that I had the key to my whole career in hand\".[32] In that same year, Krugman wrote \"The Theory of Interstellar Trade\", a tongue-in-cheek essay on computing interest rates on goods in transit near the speed of light. He says he wrote it to cheer himself up when he was \"an oppressed assistant professor\".[34]\n\nAcademic career[edit]\nKrugman giving a lecture at the German National Library in Frankfurt in 2008.\nKrugman became an assistant professor at Yale University in September 1977. He joined the faculty at MIT in 1979. From 1982 to 1983, Krugman spent a year working at the Reagan White House as a staff member of the Council of Economic Advisers. He rejoined MIT as a full professor in 1984. Krugman has also taught at Stanford, Yale, and the London School of Economics.[35]\nIn 2000, Krugman joined Princeton University as Professor of Economics and International Affairs. He is also currently Centenary Professor at the London School of Economics, and a member of the Group of Thirty international economic body.[7] He has been a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research since 1979.[36] Krugman was President of the Eastern Economic Association in 2010.[11] In February 2014, he announced that he would be retiring from Princeton in June 2015 and that he would be joining the faculty at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.[37]\nPaul Krugman has written extensively on international economics, including international trade, economic geography, and international finance. The Research Papers in Economics project ranks him among the world's most influential economists.[12] Krugman's International Economics: Theory and Policy, co-authored with Maurice Obstfeld, is a standard undergraduate textbook on international economics.[38] He is also co-author, with Robin Wells, of an undergraduate economics text which he says was strongly inspired by the first edition of Paul Samuelson's classic textbook.[39] Krugman also writes on economic topics for the general public, sometimes on international economic topics but also on income distribution and public policy.[40]\nThe Nobel Prize Committee stated that Krugman's main contribution is his analysis of the effects of economies of scale, combined with the assumption that consumers appreciate diversity, on international trade and on the location of economic activity.[9] The importance of spatial issues in economics has been enhanced by Krugman's ability to popularize this complicated theory with the help of easy-to-read books and state-of-the-art syntheses. \"Krugman was beyond doubt the key player in 'placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream' ... and in conferring it the central role it now assumes.\"[41]\n\nNew trade theory[edit]\nMain article: New trade theory\nPrior to Krugman's work, trade theory (see David Ricardo and Heckscher\u2013Ohlin model) emphasized trade based on the comparative advantage of countries with very different characteristics, such as a country with a high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity. However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the Journal of International Economics, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale.[42] Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of Volvos all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one).\n\nGraph illustrating Krugman's 'core-periphery' model. The horizontal axis represents costs of trade, while the vertical axis represents the share of either region in manufacturing. Solid lines denote stable equilibria, dashed lines denote unstable equilibria.\nKrugman modeled a 'preference for diversity' by assuming a CES utility function like that in a 1977 paper by Avinash Dixit and Joseph Stiglitz.[43][44] Many models of international trade now follow Krugman's lead, incorporating economies of scale in production and a preference for diversity in consumption.[9][45] This way of modeling trade has come to be called New Trade Theory.[41]\nKrugman's theory also took into account transportation costs, a key feature in producing the \"home market effect\", which would later feature in his work on the new economic geography. The home market effect \"states that, ceteris paribus, the country with the larger demand for a good shall, at equilibrium, produce a more than proportionate share of that good and be a net exporter of it\".[41] The home market effect was an unexpected result, and Krugman initially questioned it, but ultimately concluded that the mathematics of the model were correct.[41]\nWhen there are economies of scale in production, it is possible that countries may become 'locked into' disadvantageous patterns of trade.[46] Krugman points out that although globalization has been positive on a whole, since the 1980s the process known as hyper-globalization has at least played a part in rising inequality.[47] Nonetheless, trade remains beneficial in general, even between similar countries, because it permits firms to save on costs by producing at a larger, more efficient scale, and because it increases the range of brands available and sharpens the competition between firms.[48] Krugman has usually been supportive of free trade and globalization.[49][50] He has also been critical of industrial policy, which New Trade Theory suggests might offer nations rent-seeking advantages if \"strategic industries\" can be identified, saying it's not clear that such identification can be done accurately enough to matter.[51]\n\nNew economic geography[edit]\nIt took an interval of eleven years, but ultimately Krugman's work on New Trade Theory (NTT) converged to what is usually called the \"new economic geography\" (NEG), which Krugman began to develop in a seminal 1991 paper, \"Increasing Returns and Economic Geography\", published in the Journal of Political Economy.[52] In Krugman's own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was \"obvious in retrospect; but it certainly took me a while to see it. ... The only good news was that nobody else picked up that $100 bill lying on the sidewalk in the interim.\"[53] This would become Krugman's most-cited academic paper: by early 2009, it had 857 citations, more than double his second-ranked paper.[41] Krugman called the paper \"the love of my life in academic work\".[54]\nThe \"home market effect\" that Krugman discovered in NTT also features in NEG, which interprets agglomeration \"as the outcome of the interaction of increasing returns, trade costs and factor price differences\".[41] If trade is largely shaped by economies of scale, as Krugman's trade theory argues, then those economic regions with most production will be more profitable and will therefore attract even more production. That is, NTT implies that instead of spreading out evenly around the world, production will tend to concentrate in a few countries, regions, or cities, which will become densely populated but will also have higher levels of income.[9][14]\n\nAgglomeration and economies of scale[edit]\nManufacturing is characterized by increasing returns to scale and less restrictive and expansive land qualifications as compared to agricultural uses. So, geographically where can manufacturing be predicted to develop? Krugman states that manufacturing's geographical range is inherently limited by economies of scale, but also that manufacturing will establish and accrue itself in an area of high demand. Production that occurs adjacent to demand will result in lower transportation costs, but demand, as a result, will be greater due to concentrated nearby production. These forces act upon one another simultaneously, producing manufacturing and population agglomeration. Population will increase in these areas due to the more highly developed infrastructure and nearby production, therefore lowering the expense of goods, while economies of scale provide varied choices of goods and services. These forces will feed into each other until the greater portion of the urban population and manufacturing hubs are concentrated into a relatively insular geographic area.[55]\n\nInternational finance[edit]\nKrugman has also been influential in the field of international finance. As a graduate student, Krugman visited the Federal Reserve Board where Stephen Salant and Dale Henderson were completing their discussion paper on speculative attacks in the gold market. Krugman adapted their model for the foreign exchange market, resulting in a 1979 paper on currency crises in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, which showed that misaligned fixed exchange rate regimes are unlikely to end smoothly but instead end in a sudden speculative attack.[56] Krugman's paper is considered one of the main contributions to the 'first generation' of currency crisis models,[57][58] and it is his second-most-cited paper (457 citations as of early 2009).[41]\nIn response to the global financial crisis of 2008, Krugman proposed, in an informal \"mimeo\" style of publication,[59] an \"international finance multiplier\", to help explain the unexpected speed with which the global crisis had occurred. He argued that when, \"highly leveraged financial institutions [HLIs], which do a lot of cross-border investment [. ... ] lose heavily in one market ... they find themselves undercapitalized, and have to sell off assets across the board. This drives down prices, putting pressure on the balance sheets of other HLIs, and so on.\" Such a rapid contagion had hitherto been considered unlikely because of \"decoupling\" in a globalized economy.[60][61][62] He first announced that he was working on such a model on his blog, on October 5, 2008.[63] Within days of its appearance, it was being discussed on some popular economics-oriented blogs.[64][65]\nThe note was soon being cited in papers (draft and published) by other economists,[66] even though it had not itself been through ordinary peer review processes.\n\nMacroeconomics and fiscal policy[edit]\nPart of a series onMacroeconomics\nBasic concepts\nAggregate demand\nAggregate supply\nBusiness cycle\nDeflation\nDemand shock\nDisinflation\nEffective demand\nExpectations\nAdaptive\nRational\nFinancial crisis\nGrowth\nInflation\nDemand-pull\nCost-push\nInterest rate\nInvestment\nLiquidity trap\nMeasures of national income and output\nGDP\nGNI\nNNI\nMicrofoundations\nMoney\nEndogenous\nMoney creation\nDemand for money\nLiquidity preference\nMoney supply\nNational accounts\nSNA\nNominal rigidity\nPrice level\nRecession\nShrinkflation\nStagflation\nSupply shock\nSaving\nUnemployment\n\n\nPolicies\nFiscal\nMonetary\nCommercial\nCentral bank\nUniversal basic income\n\n\nModels\nIS\u2013LM\nAD\u2013AS\nKeynesian cross\nMultiplier\nAccelerator\nPhillips curve\nArrow\u2013Debreu\nHarrod\u2013Domar\nSolow\u2013Swan\nRamsey\u2013Cass\u2013Koopmans\nOverlapping generations\nGeneral equilibrium\nDSGE\nEndogenous growth\nMatching theory\nMundell\u2013Fleming\nOvershooting\nNAIRU\n\n\nRelated fields\nEconometrics\nEconomic statistics\nMonetary economics\nDevelopment economics\nInternational economics\n\n\nSchoolsMainstream\nKeynesian\nNeo-\nNew\nMonetarism\nNew classical\nReal business-cycle theory\nStockholm\nSupply-side\nNew neoclassical synthesis\nSaltwater and freshwater\nHeterodox\n\nAustrian\nChartalism\nModern monetary theory\nEcological\nPost-Keynesian\nCircuitism\nDisequilibrium\nMarxian\nMarket monetarism\n\n\nPeople\nFran\u00e7ois Quesnay\nAdam Smith\nThomas Robert Malthus\nKarl Marx\nL\u00e9on Walras\nKnut Wicksell\nIrving Fisher\nWesley Clair Mitchell\nJohn Maynard Keynes\nAlvin Hansen\nMicha\u0142 Kalecki\nGunnar Myrdal\nSimon Kuznets\nJoan Robinson\nFriedrich Hayek\nJohn Hicks\nRichard Stone\nHyman Minsky\nMilton Friedman\nPaul Samuelson\nLawrence Klein\nEdmund Phelps\nRobert Lucas Jr.\nEdward C.

Cochrane.[85] In June 2012, Krugman and Richard Layard launched A manifesto for economic sense, where they call for greater use of fiscal stimulus policy to reduce unemployment and foster growth.[86] The manifesto received over four thousand signatures within two days of its launch,[87] and has attracted both positive and critical responses.[88][89]\n\nPresident George W.

This prize includes an award of about $1.4\u00a0million and was given to Krugman for his work associated with New Trade Theory and the New Economic Geography.[90] In the words of the prize committee, \"By having integrated economies of scale into explicit general equilibrium models, Paul Krugman has deepened our understanding of the determinants of trade and the location of economic activity.\"[91]\n\nAwards[edit]\nPaul Krugman accepts EPI Distinguished Economist Award (2011)\n1991, American Economic Association, John Bates Clark Medal.[92] Since it was awarded to only one person, once every two years (prior to 2009), The Economist has described the Clark Medal as 'slightly harder to get than a Nobel prize'.[93]\n1992, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS).[36]\n1995, Adam Smith Award of the National Association for Business Economics[94]\n1998, Doctor honoris causa in Economics awarded by Free University of Berlin Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin in Germany\n2000, H.C.

Only nine of the prognosticators predicted more accurately than chance, two were significantly less accurate, and the remaining 14 were no better or worse than a coin flip. Krugman was correct in 15 out of 17 predictions, compared to 9 out of 11 for the next most accurate media figure, Maureen Dowd.[109]\nKrugman was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2011.[110]\nForeign Policy named Krugman one of its 2012 FP Top 100 Global Thinkers \"for wielding his acid pen against austerity\".[111]\n\nAuthor[edit]\nKrugman at the 2010 Brooklyn Book Festival.\nIn the 1990s, besides academic books and textbooks, Krugman increasingly began writing books for a general audience on issues he considered important for public policy. In The Age of Diminished Expectations (1990), he wrote in particular about the increasing US income inequality in the \"New Economy\" of the 1990s. He attributes the rise in income inequality in part to changes in technology, but principally to a change in political atmosphere which he attributes to Movement Conservatives.\nIn September 2003, Krugman published a collection of his columns under the title, The Great Unraveling, about the Bush administration's economic and foreign policies and the US economy in the early 2000s. His columns argued that the large deficits during that time were generated by the Bush administration as a result of decreasing taxes on the rich, increasing public spending, and fighting the Iraq War. Krugman wrote that these policies were unsustainable in the long run and would eventually generate a major economic crisis. The book was a best-seller.[93][112][113]\nIn 2007, Krugman published The Conscience of a Liberal, whose title refers to Barry Goldwater's Conscience of a Conservative.[114] It details the history of wealth and income gaps in the United States in the 20th century. The book describes how the gap between rich and poor declined greatly during the middle of the century, and then widened in the last two decades to levels higher even than in the 1920s. In Conscience, Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the Bush administration for implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor.\nKrugman also argued that Republicans owed their electoral successes to their ability to exploit the race issue to win political dominance of the South.[115][116] Krugman argues that Ronald Reagan had used the \"Southern Strategy\" to signal sympathy for racism without saying anything overtly racist,[117] citing as an example Reagan's coining of the term \"welfare queen\".[118]\nIn his book, Krugman proposed a \"new New Deal\", which included placing more emphasis on social and medical programs and less on national defense.[119]  In his review of Conscience of a Liberal, the liberal journalist and author Michael Tomasky credited Krugman with a commitment \"to accurate history even when some fudging might be in order for the sake of political expediency\".[115] In a review for The New York Times, Pulitzer prize-winning historian David M. Kennedy stated: \"Krugman's chapter on the imperative need for health care reform is the best in this book, a rueful reminder of the kind of skilled and accessible economic analysis of which he is capable\".[120]\nIn late 2008, Krugman published a substantial updating of an earlier work, entitled The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008. In the book, he discusses the failure of the United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published End This Depression Now!, a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy \u2013 people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.[121]\n\nCommentator[edit]\nMartin Wolf has written that Krugman is both the \"most hated and most admired columnist in the US\".[122]\nEconomist J. Peter Neary has noted that Krugman \"has written on a wide range of topics, always combining one of the best prose styles in the profession with an ability to construct elegant, insightful and useful models\".[123] Neary added that \"no discussion of his work could fail to mention his transition from Academic Superstar to Public Intellectual. Through his extensive writings, including a regular column for The New York Times, monographs and textbooks at every level, and books on economics and current affairs for the general public ... he has probably done more than any other writer to explain economic principles to a wide audience.\"[123] Krugman has been described as the most controversial economist in his generation[124][125] and according to Michael Tomasky since 1992 he has moved \"from being a center-left scholar to being a liberal polemicist\".[115]\nFrom the mid-1990s onwards, Krugman wrote for Fortune (1997\u201399)[36] and Slate (1996\u201399),[36] and then for The Harvard Business Review, Foreign Policy, The Economist, Harper's, and Washington Monthly. In this period Krugman critiqued various positions commonly taken on economic issues from across the political spectrum, from protectionism and opposition to the World Trade Organization on the left to supply-side economics on the right.[126]\nDuring the 1992 presidential campaign, Krugman praised Bill Clinton's economic plan in The New York Times, and Clinton's campaign used some of Krugman's work on income inequality. At the time, it was considered likely that Clinton would offer him a position in the new administration, but allegedly Krugman's volatility and outspokenness caused Clinton to look elsewhere.[124] Krugman later said that he was \"temperamentally unsuited for that kind of role. You have to be very good at people skills, biting your tongue when people say silly things.\"[126][127] In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Krugman added, \"you have to be reasonably organized ... I can move into a pristine office and within three days it will look like a grenade went off.\"[128]\nIn 1999, near the height of the dot com boom, The New York Times approached Krugman to write a bi-weekly column on \"the vagaries of business and economics in an age of prosperity\".[126] His first columns in 2000 addressed business and economic issues, but as the 2000 US presidential campaign progressed, Krugman increasingly focused on George W. Bush's policy proposals. According to Krugman, this was partly due to \"the silence of the media \u2013 those 'liberal media' conservatives complain about ...\"[126] Krugman accused Bush of repeatedly misrepresenting his proposals, and criticized the proposals themselves.[126] After Bush's election, and his perseverance with his proposed tax cut in the midst of the slump (which Krugman argued would do little to help the economy but substantially raise the fiscal deficit), Krugman's columns grew angrier and more focused on the administration. As Alan Blinder put it in 2002, \"There's been a kind of missionary quality to his writing since then ... He's trying to stop something now, using the power of the pen.\"[126] Partly as a result, Krugman's twice-weekly column on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times has made him, according to Nicholas Confessore, \"the most important political columnist in America ... he is almost alone in analyzing the most important story in politics in recent years \u2013 the seamless melding of corporate, class, and political party interests at which the Bush administration excels.\"[126] In an interview in late 2009, Krugman said his missionary zeal had changed in the post-Bush era and he described the Obama administration as \"good guys but not as forceful as I'd like ... When I argue with them in my column this is a serious discussion. We really are in effect speaking across the transom here.\"[129] Krugman says he's more effective at driving change outside the administration than inside it, \"now, I'm trying to make this progressive moment in American history a success. So that's where I'm pushing.\"[129]\nKrugman's columns have drawn criticism as well as praise. A 2003 article in The Economist[130] questioned Krugman's \"growing tendency to attribute all the world's ills to George Bush\", citing critics who felt that \"his relentless partisanship is getting in the way of his argument\" and claiming errors of economic and political reasoning in his columns.[93] Daniel Okrent, a former The New York Times ombudsman, in his farewell column, criticized Krugman for what he said was \"the disturbing habit of shaping, slicing and selectively citing numbers in a fashion that pleases his acolytes but leaves him open to substantive assaults\".[131][132]\nKrugman's New York Times blog is \"The Conscience of a Liberal\", devoted largely to economics and politics.\nFive days after 9/11 terrorist attacks, Krugman argued in his column that the calamity was \"partly self-inflicted\", citing poor pay and training for airport security driven by the transfer of responsibility for airport security from government to airlines. His column provoked an angry response and The New York Times was flooded with complaints. According to Larissa MacFarquhar of The New Yorker, while some people[who?] thought that he was too partisan to be a columnist for The New York Times, he was revered on the left.[133][134] Similarly, on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 on the United States Krugman again provoked a controversy by accusing on his New York Times blog former U.S. President George W. Bush and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani of rushing \"to cash in on the horror\" after the attacks and describing the anniversary as \"an occasion for shame\".[135][136]\nKrugman was noteworthy for his fierce opposition to the 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders. On January 19, 2016, he wrote an article which criticized Bernie Sanders for his perceived lack of political realism, compared Sanders' plans for healthcare and financial reform unfavorably to those of Hillary Clinton, and cited criticisms of Sanders from other liberal policy wonks like Mike Konczal and Ezra Klein.[137] Later, Krugman wrote an article which accused Sanders of \"[going] for easy slogans over hard thinking\" and attacking Hillary Clinton in a way that was \"just plain dishonest\".[138]\nOn the 12 July 2016, Krugman tweeted \"leprechaun economics\", in response to Central Statistics Office (Ireland) data that 2015 GDP grew 26.3% and 2015 GNP grew 18.7%. The leprechaun economics affair (proved in 2018 to be Apple restructuring its double Irish subsidiaries), led to the Central Bank of Ireland introducing a new economic statistic, Modified gross national income (or GNI*) to better measure the Irish economy (2016 Irish GDP is 143% of 2016 Irish GNI*).  The term leprechaun economics has since been used by Krugman,[139][140] and others,[141][142]  to describe distorted/unsound economic data.\nKrugman's use of the term leprechaun to refer to Ireland and its people has raised rebuke. In June 2021, Krugman wrote an article titled, \"Yellen's New Alliance Against Leprechauns\".[143] Following the article, the Irish Ambassador to the US, Daniel Mulhall, wrote a letter to his publisher saying, \"This is not the first time your columnist has used the word 'leprechaun' when referring to Ireland, and I see it as my duty to point out that this represents an unacceptable slur.\"[144]\nKrugman harshly criticized the Trump administration.[145] He has also remarked several times on how Trump tempts him to assume the worst, such that he has to be careful to check his personal beliefs against the weight of evidence.[citation needed]\n\nEast Asian growth[edit]\nIn a 1994 Foreign Affairs article, Paul Krugman argued that it was a myth that the economic successes of the East Asian 'tigers' constituted an economic miracle. He argued that their rise was fueled by mobilizing resources and that their growth rates would inevitably slow.[146] His article helped popularize the argument made by Lawrence Lau and Alwyn Young, among others, that the growth of economies in East Asia was not the result of new and original economic models, but rather from high capital investment and increasing labor force participation, and that total factor productivity had not increased. Krugman argued that in the long term, only increasing total factor productivity can lead to sustained economic growth. Krugman's article was highly criticized in many Asian countries when it first appeared, and subsequent studies disputed some of Krugman's conclusions. However, it also stimulated a great deal of research, and may have caused the Singapore government to provide incentives for technological progress.[147]\nDuring the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Krugman advocated currency controls as a way to mitigate the crisis. Writing in a Fortune magazine article, he suggested exchange controls as \"a solution so unfashionable, so stigmatized, that hardly anyone has dared suggest it\".[148] Malaysia was the only country that adopted such controls, and although the Malaysian government credited its rapid economic recovery on currency controls, the relationship is disputed.[149] An empirical study found that the Malaysian policies produced faster economic recovery and smaller declines in employment and real wages.[150] Krugman later stated that the controls might not have been necessary at the time they were applied, but that nevertheless \"Malaysia has proved a point \u2013 namely, that controlling capital in a crisis is at least feasible.\"[151] Krugman more recently pointed out that emergency capital controls have even been endorsed by the IMF, and are no longer considered radical policy.[152][153][154]\n\nU.S. economic policies[edit]\nIn the early 2000s, Krugman repeatedly criticized the Bush tax cuts, both before and after they were enacted. Krugman argued that the tax cuts enlarged the budget deficit without improving the economy, and that they enriched the wealthy \u2013 worsening income distribution in the US.[113][155][156][157][158] Krugman advocated lower interest rates (to promote investment and spending on housing and other durable goods), and increased government spending on infrastructure, military, and unemployment benefits, arguing that these policies would have a larger stimulus effect, and unlike permanent tax cuts, would only temporarily increase the budget deficit.[158][159] In addition, he was against Bush's proposal to privatize social security.[160]\nIn August 2005, after Alan Greenspan expressed concern over housing markets, Krugman criticized Greenspan's earlier reluctance to regulate the mortgage and related financial markets, arguing that \"[he's] like a man who suggests leaving the barn door ajar, and then \u2013 after the horse is gone \u2013 delivers a lecture on the importance of keeping your animals properly locked up.\"[161] Krugman has repeatedly expressed his view that Greenspan and Phil Gramm are the two individuals most responsible for causing the subprime crisis. Krugman points to Greenspan and Gramm for the key roles they played in keeping derivatives, financial markets, and investment banks unregulated, and to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed Great Depression era safeguards that prevented commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies from merging.[162][163][164][165]\nKrugman has also been critical of some of the Obama administration's economic policies. He has criticized the Obama stimulus plan as being too small and inadequate given the size of the economy and the banking rescue plan as misdirected; Krugman wrote in The New York Times: \"an overwhelming majority [of the American public] believes that the government is spending too much to help large financial institutions. This suggests that the administration's money-for-nothing financial policy will eventually deplete its political capital.\"[166] In particular, he considered the Obama administration's actions to prop up the US financial system in 2009 to be impractical and unduly favorable to Wall Street bankers.[132] In anticipation of President Obama's Job Summit in December 2009, Krugman said in a Fresh Dialogues interview, \"This jobs summit can't be an empty exercise ... he can't come out with a proposal for $10 or $20\u00a0Billion of stuff because people will view that as a joke. There has to be a significant job proposal ... I have in mind something like $300\u00a0Billion.\"[167]\nKrugman has criticized China's exchange rate policy, which he believes to be a significant drag on global economic recovery from the Late-2000s recession, and he has advocated a \"surcharge\" on Chinese imports to the US in response.[168] Jeremy Warner of The Daily Telegraph accused Krugman of advocating a return to self-destructive protectionism.[169]\nIn April 2010, as the Senate began considering new financial regulations, Krugman argued that the regulations should not only regulate financial innovation, but also tax financial-industry profits and remuneration. He cited a paper by Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny released the previous week, which concludes that most innovation was in fact about \"providing investors with false substitutes for [traditional] assets like bank deposits\", and once investors realize the sheer number of securities that are unsafe a \"flight to safety\" occurs which necessarily leads to \"financial fragility\".[170][171]\nIn his June 28, 2010, column in The New York Times, in light of the recent G-20 Toronto Summit, Krugman criticized world leaders for agreeing to halve deficits by 2013. Krugman claimed that these efforts could lead the global economy into the early stages of a \"third depression\" and leave \"millions of lives blighted by the absence of jobs\". He advocated instead the continued stimulus of economies to foster greater growth.[172]\nIn a 2014 review of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century he stated we are in a Second Gilded Age.[173]\n\nEconomic views[edit]\nKeynesian economics[edit]\nKrugman identifies as a Keynesian[174][175] and a saltwater economist,[176] and he has criticized the freshwater school on macroeconomics.[177][178] Although he has used New Keynesian theory in his work, he has also criticized it for lacking predictive power and for hewing to ideas like the efficient-market hypothesis and rational expectations.[178] Since the 1990s, he has promoted the practical use of the IS-LM model of the neoclassical synthesis, pointing out its relative simplicity compared to New Keynesian models, and its continued currency in economic policy analysis.[179][180][181]\nIn the wake of the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis he has remarked that he is \"gravitating towards a Keynes-Fisher-Minsky view of macroeconomics\".[182] Post-Keynesian observers cite commonalities between Krugman's views and those of the Post-Keynesian school,[183][184][185] although Krugman has been critical of some Post-Keynesian economists such as John Kenneth Galbraith \u2013 whose works The New Industrial State (1967) and Economics in Perspective (1987) Krugman has referred to as not \"real economic theory\" and \"remarkably ill-informed\" respectively.[186] In recent academic work, he has collaborated with Gauti Eggertsson on a New Keynesian model of debt-overhang and debt-driven slumps, inspired by the writings of Irving Fisher, Hyman Minsky, and Richard Koo. Their work argues that during a debt-driven slump, the \"paradox of toil\", together with the paradox of flexibility, can exacerbate a liquidity trap, reducing demand and employment.[187]\n\nFree trade[edit]\nKrugman's support for free trade in the 1980s\u20131990s provoked some ire from the anti-globalization movement.[188][189][190] In 1987 he quipped that, \"If there were an Economist's Creed, it would surely contain the affirmations 'I understand the Principle of Comparative Advantage' and 'I advocate Free Trade'.\"[191][192] However, Krugman argues in the same article that, given the findings of New Trade Theory, \"[free trade] has shifted from optimum to reasonable rule of thumb ... it can never again be asserted as the policy that economic theory tells us is always right.\" In the article, Krugman comes out in favor of free trade given the enormous political costs of actively engaging in strategic trade policy and because there is no clear method for a government to discover which industries will ultimately yield positive returns. He also notes that increasing returns and strategic trade theory do not disprove the underlying truth of comparative advantage.\nIn the midst of the 2009 Great Recession, Krugman made a significant departure from his general support for free trade, entertaining the idea of a 25% tariff on Chinese imports as a retaliation for China's policy of maintaining a low value for the renminbi, which many saw as hostile currency manipulation, artificially making their exports more competitive.[193]\nIn 2015, Krugman noted his ambivalence about the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, as the agreement was not mainly about trade and, \"whatever you may say about the benefits of free trade, most of those benefits have already been realized\" [by existing agreements].[194]\nAfter the 2016 elections, and Trump's moves towards protectionism, he wrote that while protectionism can make economies less efficient and reduce long-term growth, it would not directly cause recessions. He noted that if there is a trade war, imports would decrease as much as exports, so employment should not be strongly impacted, at least in the medium to long run.[195] He believes that the US should not repeat Reagan's 1981 policy on taxes and quotas on imported products,[196] as even if it does not produce a recession, protectionism would shock \"value chains\" and disrupt jobs and communities in the same way as free trade in the past. In addition, other countries would take retaliatory measures against US exports.[197] Krugman recommended against the abandonment of NAFTA, because it could cause economic losses and disruptions to businesses, jobs, and communities.[198]\nIn the late 2010s, Krugman admitted that the models that scholars used to measure the impact of globalization in the 1990s underestimated the effect on jobs and inequality in developed countries such as the US.[199][200] He noted that although free trade has harmed some industries, communities, and some workers, it remains a win-win system overall, enriching both parties to the agreement at the national level; a trade war is equivalently negative for the nations involved, even while it may benefit some individuals or industries within each nation.[201]\n\nImmigration[edit]\nKrugman wrote in March 2006: \"Immigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants. That's just supply and demand: we're talking about large increases in the number of low-skill workers relative to other inputs into production, so it's inevitable that this means a fall in wages ... the fiscal burden of low-wage immigrants is also pretty clear.\"[202]\n\nGreen economy[edit]\nKrugman has called for a transition to a green economy.[203][204] He supported the Green New Deal.,[205] asserting \"I believe progressives should enthusiastically embrace the G.N.D.\".[206] He said that a \"Green New Deal stuff is investment. On that stuff, don't worry about paying for it. Debt as an issue is vastly overstated, and a lot of these things pay for themselves. Go ahead and just deficit finance it.\"[207] In 2021, he wrote that \"we will almost surely have to put a price\" on greenhouse gas emissions.[208] He criticized Democratic \"moderates\" and corporations \"torpedoing efforts to avoid a civilization-threatening crisis because you want to hold down your tax bill\".[209]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nKrugman describes himself as liberal and has explained that he views the term \"liberal\" in the American context to mean \"more or less what social democratic means in Europe\".[114] In a 2009 Newsweek article, Evan Thomas described Krugman as having \"all the credentials of a ranking member of the East coast liberal establishment\" but also as someone who is anti-establishment, a \"scourge of the Bush administration\", and a critic of the Obama administration.[132] In 1996, Newsweek's Michael Hirsh remarked, \"Say this for Krugman: though an unabashed liberal ... he's ideologically colorblind. He savages the supply-siders of the Reagan\u2013Bush era with the same glee as he does the 'strategic traders' of the Clinton administration.\"[124]\nKrugman has at times advocated free markets in contexts where they are often viewed as controversial. He has written against rent control and land-use restrictions in favor of market supply and demand,[210][211] likened the opposition against free trade and globalization to the opposition against evolution via natural selection (1996),[189] opposed farm subsidies,[212] argued that sweatshops are preferable to unemployment,[49] dismissed the case for living wages (1998),[213] and argued against mandates, subsidies, and tax breaks for ethanol (2000).[214] In 2003, he questioned the usefulness of NASA's manned space flights given the available technology and their high financial cost compared to their general benefits.[215] Krugman has also criticized U.S. zoning laws[216] and European labor market regulation.[217][218]\nKrugman endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[219]\n\nU.S. race relations[edit]\nKrugman has criticized the Republican Party leadership for what he sees as a strategic (but largely tacit) reliance on racial divisions.[220][221][222] In his Conscience of a Liberal, he wrote:\n\nThe changing politics of race made it possible for a revived conservative movement, whose ultimate goal was to reverse the achievements of the New Deal, to win national elections \u2013 even though it supported policies that favored the interests of a narrow elite over those of middle- and lower-income Americans.[223]\nOn working in the Reagan administration[edit]\nKrugman worked for Martin Feldstein when the latter was appointed chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and chief economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan. He later wrote in an autobiographical essay, \"It was, in a way, strange for me to be part of the Reagan Administration. I was then and still am an unabashed defender of the welfare state, which I regard as the most decent social arrangement yet devised.\"[32] Krugman found the time \"thrilling, then disillusioning\". He did not fit into the Washington political environment and was not tempted to stay on.[32]\n\nOn Gordon Brown vs. David Cameron[edit]\nAccording to Krugman, Gordon Brown and his party were unfairly blamed for the late-2000s financial crisis.[224] He has also praised the former British prime minister, whom he described as \"more impressive than any US politician\" after a three-hour conversation with him.[225] Krugman asserted that Brown \"defined the character of the worldwide financial rescue effort\" and urged British voters not to support the opposition Conservative Party in the 2010 general election, arguing their Party Leader David Cameron \"has had little to offer other than to raise the red flag of fiscal panic\".[224][226]\n\nOn the Iraq War[edit]\nKrugman opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[227] He wrote in his New York Times column: \"What we should have learned from the Iraq debacle was that you should always be skeptical and that you should never rely on supposed authority. If you hear that 'everyone' supports a policy, whether it's a war of choice or fiscal austerity, you should ask whether 'everyone' has been defined to exclude anyone expressing a different opinion.\"[228]\n\nOn Donald Trump[edit]\nKrugman has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump and his administration.[229] His criticisms have included the president's climate change proposals, economic policy,[230] the Republican tax plan and Trump's foreign policy initiatives. Krugman has often used his op-ed column in The New York Times to set out arguments against the president's policies. On election night in 2016, Krugman wrongly predicted in a New York Times op-ed that the markets would never recover under Trump and stated \"first-pass answer is never\"[231][232] but retracted the call in the same publication three days later.[233] Trump gave him a 'Fake News Award'. Krugman stated \"I get a 'fake news award' for a bad market call, retracted 3 days later, from 2000-lie man, who still won't admit he lost the popular vote. Sad!\"[234]\n\nOn Russia under Vladimir Putin[edit]\nIn his New York Times column, Krugman described Russia as a \"Potemkin superpower\" in reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. He stated that \"Russia is even weaker than most people, myself included, seem to have realized\", that the military performance of Russia \"has been less effective than advertised\" in a stalemate at the beginning of the invasion, and that Russia encountered serious logistical problems. Krugman observed that the country's total gross domestic product is only a bit more than half as large as those of countries such as Britain and France, despite Russia's greater landmass, total population and natural resource endowment. He also noted that Russia's economy was further weakened by international sanctions as a result of the war. He concluded that Russia had \"far less real strength than meets the eye.\"[235]\n\nViews on technology[edit]\nIn 1998 during the dot-com bubble, Krugman wrote a commentary for Red Herring that urged skepticism of optimistic predictions for technology-driven progress. He followed it with several pessimistic predictions of his own, including that \"[b]y 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's\"[236][237] and that the number of jobs for IT specialists would decelerate and turn down.[236] In a 2013 interview, Krugman stated that the predictions were meant to be \"fun and provocative, not to engage in careful forecasting\".[238]\nKrugman is a vocal critic of Bitcoin,[238] arguing against its economic soundness since 2011.[239][240] In 2017, he predicted that Bitcoin is a more obvious bubble than housing and stated that \"[t]here's been no demonstration yet that it actually is helpful in conducting economic transactions\".[241]\nIn December 2022 Krugman predicted that, because of generative AI such as ChatGPT, \"quite a few knowledge jobs may be eminently replaceable\". He suggested that such technology would likely prove beneficial \"in the long run\", but that \"in the long run, we are all dead, and even before that, some of us may find ourselves either unemployed or earning far less than we expected\".[242]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nKrugman has been married twice. His first wife, Robin L. Bergman, is a designer.[243][244] He is currently married to Robin Wells, an academic economist who received her BA from the University of Chicago and her PhD from the University of California, Berkeley.[245] She, as did Krugman, taught at MIT. Together, Krugman and his wife have collaborated on several economics textbooks. Although rumors began to circulate in early 2007 that Krugman's \"son\" was working for Hillary Clinton's campaign, Krugman reiterated in his New York Times op-ed column that he and his wife are childless.[246][247][3]\nKrugman currently lives in New York City.[248] Upon retiring from Princeton after fifteen years of teaching in June 2015, he addressed the issue in his column, stating that while he retains the utmost praise and respect for Princeton, he wishes to reside in New York City and hopes to focus more on public policy issues.[249] He subsequently became a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and a distinguished scholar at the Graduate Center's Luxembourg Income Study Center.[249][250]\nKrugman reports that he is a distant relative of conservative journalist David Frum.[251] He has described himself as a \"Loner. Ordinarily shy. Shy with individuals.\"[252]\n\nPublished works[edit]\nAcademic books (authored or coauthored)[edit]\nThe Spatial Economy \u2013 Cities, Regions and International Trade (July 1999), with Masahisa Fujita and Anthony Venables.

During his tenure as chairman, Volcker was widely credited with having ended the high levels of inflation seen in the United States throughout the 1970s and early 1980s,[3] with measures known as the Volcker shock.[4][5][6] He previously served as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1975 to 1979.\nPresident Jimmy Carter nominated him to succeed G. William Miller as Fed chairman and President Ronald Reagan renominated him once. Volcker did not seek a third term at the Fed and was succeeded by Alan Greenspan. After his retirement from the Board, he chaired the Economic Recovery Advisory Board under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 during the subprime mortgage crisis.[7]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nVolcker was born in Cape May, New Jersey, the son of Alma Louise (n\u00e9e Klippel, 1892\u20131990) and Paul Adolph Volcker (1889\u20131960).[8]  All his grandparents were of German origin. Volcker grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey, where his father was the township's first municipal manager. Paul Sr. thrived in the role for 20 years as he improved the burgeoning town's economic stability and the local government's effectiveness.[9] Paul Jr. had four older sisters: Ruth (1916\u20131991), Louise (1918\u20131966), Elinor (1922\u20131923) and Virginia Streitfeld (1924\u20132011). As a child, he attended his mother's Lutheran church, while his father went to an Episcopal church. Volcker graduated from Teaneck High School in 1945,[8] where he participated in several student groups and impressed his peers and teachers with his knowledge of politics.[10]\nVolcker attended Princeton University as an undergraduate student and graduated with highest honors from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs (now the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs) in 1949. In his senior thesis, titled \"The Problems of Federal Reserve Policy since World War II\", Volcker criticized the Federal Reserve's post-WWII policies for failing to curb inflationary pressures, writing, \"a swollen money supply presented a grave inflationary threat to the economy. There was a need to bring this money supply under control if the disastrous effects of a sharp price rise were to be avoided.\"[11][12][13] Following a summer as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he moved to Harvard University to earn an M.A. in political economy from its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Graduate School of Public Administration. He worked a second summer as a New York Fed research assistant before graduating in 1951. After Harvard, Volcker attended the London School of Economics from 1951 to 1952 as a Rotary Foundation Ambassadorial Fellow under Rotary's Ambassadorial Scholarships program.[14]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 1952, Volcker joined the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a full-time economist. He left that position in 1957 to become a financial economist with the Chase Manhattan Bank. In 1962, Robert Roosa, who had been his mentor at the Federal Reserve, hired him at the Treasury Department as director of financial analysis.[15] In 1963, he became deputy under secretary for monetary affairs. He returned to Chase Manhattan Bank as vice president and director of planning in 1965.[16]\nAppointed by the Nixon Administration, Volcker served under secretary of the Treasury for international monetary affairs from 1969 to 1974. He played an important role in President Richard Nixon's decision to suspend gold convertibility of the dollar on August 15, 1971, which resulted in the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Volcker considered the suspension of gold convertibility \"the single most important event of his career.\"[17] Because of his position as under secretary, Volcker served as a board member for OPIC and Fannie Mae.[18] Across the policies he worked on, he acted as a moderating influence on policy, advocating the pursuit of an international solution to monetary problems and acting as a negotiator with other nations' policymakers.[19] After leaving the U.S. Treasury, he spent a year as a senior fellow at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School (his alma mater). In 1975, he became President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and he retained that role until he became Federal Reserve Chairman in August 1979.[16]\n\nChairman of the Federal Reserve[edit]\nPortrait of Paul A. Volcker by Luis Alvarez Roure. Collection of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C.\nAfter G. William Miller's confirmation as Secretary of the Treasury, President Jimmy Carter's confirmation of Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Frederick H. Schultz's role as Acting Chairman sent markets panicking. Carter resultingly sought a reassuring, qualified nominee who would confront inflation head-on, and nominated Paul Volcker to serve as chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on July 25, 1979.[20][21] He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 2, 1979, and took office on August 6, 1979.[22] President Ronald Reagan renominated Volcker to a second term in 1983.[23][24]\nInflation emerged as an economic and political challenge in the United States during the 1970s. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve board, led by Volcker, were widely credited with curbing the rate of inflation and expectations that inflation would continue. US inflation, which peaked at 14.8 percent in March 1980, fell below 3 percent by 1983.[25][3] The Federal Reserve board led by Volcker raised the federal funds rate, which had averaged 11.2% in 1979, to a peak of 20% in June 1981. The prime rate rose to 21.5% in 1981 as well, which helped lead to the 1980\u20131982 recession,[26] in which the national unemployment rate rose to over 10%. In addition to the rises in key interest rates, the so-called 'Volcker shock' included monetarist-inspired policies, such as monetary targeting. Despite the fact that monetarist economists did not recognize Volcker policies to be totally monetarist, some members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) claimed to follow monetarist principles.[27]\nVolcker's Federal Reserve board elicited the strongest political attacks and most widespread protests in the history of the Federal Reserve (unlike any protests experienced since 1922), due to the effects of high interest rates on the construction, farming, and industrial sectors, culminating in indebted farmers driving their tractors onto C Street NW in Washington, D.C. and blockading the Eccles Building.[28] US monetary policy eased in 1982, helping lead to a resumption of economic growth.\nThe US current account was in permanent deficit by the 1990s.  Volcker himself tried to remedy the situation by the Plaza Accord in 1986, which called for Germany and Japan to revalue relative to the US dollar.[29]\nThe combination of the Fed's tight money policies and the expansive fiscal policy of the Reagan Administration (large tax cuts and a major increase in military spending) produced large federal budget deficits and significant macroeconomic imbalances in the U.S. economy. The combination of growing federal debt and high interest rates led to a substantial rise in federal net interest costs. The sharp rise of interest costs and large deficits led Congress to take some steps towards fiscal constraint.[30]\nNobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz said about him in an interview:\n\nPaul Volcker, the previous Fed Chairman known for keeping inflation under control, was fired because the Reagan administration didn't believe he was an adequate de-regulator.[31]\nCongressman Ron Paul, well known as a harsh critic of the Federal Reserve, offered qualified praise of Volcker:\n\nBeing in Congress in the late 1970s and early 1980s and serving on the House Banking Committee, I met and got to question several Federal Reserve chairmen: Arthur Burns, G. William Miller, and Paul Volcker. Of the three, I had the most interaction with Volcker. He was more personable and smarter than the others, including the more recent board chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.[32]\nIn 1983, Volcker received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.[33]\n\nPost-Federal Reserve[edit]\nVolcker in 2014 with Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke\nAfter leaving the Federal Reserve in 1987, he became chairman of the prominent New York investment banking firm, Wolfensohn & Co., a corporate advisory and investment firm run by James D. Wolfensohn (who later became President of the World Bank).[34][35]\nIn 1992, Volcker was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[36]\nIn 1993 he chaired the Group of 30 Report on the Derivatives market entitled \"Derivatives: Practices and Principles\"[37] with several appendices and a survey on how practices may have changed since the original 1993 report.[38]  The Group of 30 is a \"consultative group on international economic and monetary affairs.\" Volcker was their Chairman emeritus.[39]\nIn 1996, he took up the chair of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (Volcker Commission) to look into the dormant accounts of Jewish victims of the Holocaust lying in Swiss banks. This included a \"massive accounting of Swiss bank records.\" In the midst of a contentious process (the committee was formed by three Jewish representatives and three representatives of Swiss banks), he was able to bring about an agreement among the parties for a settlement of $1.25 billion.[40]\nVolcker was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1992.[36]\nIn 2000 he accepted the Chairmanship of the IFRS Trustees, the not-for-profit funding arm of the International Accounting Standards Board (later the IFRS Foundation). The IFRS Foundation is a private sector enterprise based in London which seeks to develop a single global accounting model, subject to adoption country by country under their rules of law.[41]\nIn April 2004, the United Nations assigned Volcker to research possible corruption in the Iraqi Oil for Food program. In the report summarizing its research, Volcker criticized Kojo Annan, son of then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and the Swiss company Cotecna Inspection SA, Kojo's employer, for trying to conceal their relationship. He concluded in his March 2005, report that \"there is no evidence that the selection of Cotecna, in 1998, was subject to improper influence of the Secretary General in the bidding or selection process.\"[42] While Volcker did not implicate the Secretary General in the selection process, however, he did cast serious doubt on Kofi Annan, whose \"management performance ... fell short of the standards that the United Nations Organization should strive to maintain.\"[43] Volcker was a director of the United Nations Association of the United States of America between 2000 and 2004,[44][45] prior to his being appointed to the Independent Inquiry by Kofi Annan.[46]\nAs of October 2006, he was the chairman of the board of trustees of the influential Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty, and a member of the Trilateral Commission. He had a long association with the Rockefeller family, not only with his positions at Chase Bank and the Trilateral Commission, but also through membership of the trust committee of Rockefeller Group, Inc., which he joined in 1987. That entity managed, at one time, the Rockefeller Center on behalf of the numerous members of the Rockefeller family. He was a chairman and an honorary trustee of International House, the cultural exchange residence and program center in New York City. He was a founding member of the Trilateral Commission and a long-time member of the Bilderberg Group.[citation needed]\nIn January 2008, he endorsed Democratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama in the upcoming presidential election.[47]\nOn April 8, 2008, he was the featured speaker at The Economic Club of New York. Volcker discussed \"what appears to be in substance a direct transfer of mortgage and mortgage-backed securities of questionable pedigree from an investment bank to the Federal Reserve,\" and offered his detailed analysis and evaluation of interrelationships among the U.S. capital markets, Federal Reserve policies, and the economy as whole.[48]\nPaul Volcker appeared in the Charles Ferguson's movie Inside Job. He was interviewed about current Wall Street CEO pay, claiming it is \"excessive.\"[49]\nVolcker was an economic advisor to President Barack Obama, heading the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board.[50][51][52] Volcker had also been Obama's first pick as United States Secretary of the Treasury, but he was considered too old.[53] During the financial crisis, Volcker was extremely critical of banks, saying that their response to the financial crisis was inadequate, and that more regulation of banks is called for.[54][55][56] Specifically, Volcker called for a break-up of the nation's largest banks, prohibiting deposit-taking institutions from engaging in riskier activities such as proprietary trading, private equity, and hedge fund investments (see Volcker Rule).[57][58]  Volcker left the board when its charter expired on February 6, 2011, without being included in discussions on how the board would be reconstituted.[59]\nOn January 21, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed bank regulations which he dubbed \"The Volcker Rule,\" in reference to Volcker's aggressive pursuit of these regulations.[60] Volcker appeared with the president at the announcement. The proposed rules would prevent commercial banks from owning and investing in hedge funds and private equity, and limit the trading they do for their own accounts.[61] According to SEC Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar, \"[t]he success or failure of the Volcker Rule will depend on the manner in which banking entities comply with the letter and spirit of the rule, and on the willingness of regulators to enforce it.\"[62]\nVolcker was known to defy the stereotype of a Wall Street insider. A profile in The Week for February 5, 2010, stated that Volcker does not agree with the conventional wisdom that \"financial innovation\" is necessary for a healthy economy. In fact, he likes to say, \"the only useful banking innovation was the invention of the ATM.\"[63]\nOn April 6, 2010, at the New-York Historical Society's Global Economic Panel, Volcker commented that the United States should consider adding a national sales tax similar to the Value Added Tax (VAT) imposed in European countries, stating \"If, at the end of the day, we need to raise taxes, we should raise taxes.\"[64]\nIn 2011, Volcker and former Secretary of State George Shultz authored an article in The Wall Street Journal voicing their opinion that the War on Drugs had failed. They did not advocate for the legalization of drugs, but rather for a reexamination of the costs of drug prohibition in the United States.[65]\nIn 2015, Volcker donated his public service papers to Princeton University's Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library.[66]\n\nWorld Justice Project[edit]\nVolcker served as an honorary co-chairman for the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project works to lead a global, multi-disciplinary effort to strengthen the rule of law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.[citation needed]\n\nVolcker Alliance[edit]\nIn 2013, Volcker founded the nonprofit organization the Volcker Alliance to address the challenge of effective execution of public policies and to rebuild public trust in government.[67][68] The nonpartisan Alliance works toward that objective by partnering with other organizations\u2014academic, business, governmental, and public interest\u2014to strengthen professional education for public service, conduct needed research on government performance, and improve the efficiency and accountability of governmental organization at the federal, state, and local levels.[69]\n\nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget[edit]\nVolcker served on the board of directors of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.[70] The nonpartisan organization is \"committed to educating the public on issues with significant fiscal policy impact.\"[71]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nVolcker married Barbara Bahnson, the daughter of a physician, on September 11, 1954. They had two children, Janice, a nurse and a Georgetown University graduate,[72] and James, a research assistant and a New York University graduate[73] who was born with cerebral palsy.

    "wiki": "Paul Waldman (born February 27, 1968) is a liberal American op-ed columnist and senior writer for The American Prospect, as well as a contributor to The Week and a blogger for the Washington Post's Plum Line blog.\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nWaldman was formerly a senior researcher at the Annenberg Public Policy Center.[1] From 2004 to 2009, he worked at Media Matters for America.[2] In 2020, referencing a Ta-Nehisi Coates article which described Donald Trump as \"the first white president\", Waldman has proposed that Trump, drawing on decades of rhetoric which amplifies \"whiteness as an identity and locus of oppression\", has utilized white identity into a foundational aspect of his presidency.[3]\n\nBooks[edit]\nThe Press Effect: Politicians, Journalists, and the Stories That Shape the Political World (2000, with Kathleen Hall Jamieson)\nFraud: The Strategy Behind the Bush Lies and why the Media Didn't Tell You (2004)\nBeing Right is Not Enough: What Progressives Must Learn From Conservative Success (2006)\nFree Ride: John McCain and the Media (2008, with David Brock)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The National Annenberg Election Survey\".

Retrieved 19 May 2016.\n\n^ Paul Waldman (February 5, 2020). \"How Rush Limbaugh made the Trump presidency possible\". The Washington Post. The effect is to increase the salience of whiteness as an identity and locus of oppression, an idea that came to fruition in Trump's presidential candidacy. As Ta-Nehisi Coates has written, Trump is \"the first white president,\" in that he is the first president who elevated white identity to such a central place in his political project.\n\n\nExternal links[edit]\n\n\n\nWikiquote has quotations related to Paul Waldman.\n\nBiography at the Week\nAppearances on C-SPAN\nAuthority control databases International\nFAST\nISNI\nVIAF\nNational\nIsrael\nBelgium\nUnited States\nNetherlands\nPoland\nOther\nIdRef\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Waldman&oldid=1175367006\"",
