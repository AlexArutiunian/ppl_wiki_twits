He served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency from September 6, 2011,[3] until his resignation on November 9, 2012.[4] Prior to his assuming the directorship of the CIA, Petraeus served 37 years in the United States Army. His last assignments in the Army were as commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and commander, U.S. Forces \u2013 Afghanistan (USFOR-A) from July 4, 2010, to July 18, 2011. His other four-star assignments include serving as the 10th commander, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) from October 13, 2008, to June 30, 2010, and as commanding general, Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq (MNF-I) from February 10, 2007, to September 16, 2008.[5] As commander of MNF-I, Petraeus oversaw all coalition forces in Iraq.[6][7]\nPetraeus was the General George C. Marshall Award winner as the top graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College class of 1983.[8] He later served as assistant professor of international relations at the United States Military Academy and also completed a fellowship at Georgetown University.[9]\nPetraeus has repeatedly stated that he has no plans to run for elected political office.[10][11][12] On June 23, 2010, President Barack Obama nominated Petraeus to succeed General Stanley McChrystal as commanding general of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, technically a step down from his position as Commander of United States Central Command, which oversees the military efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Central Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, and Egypt.[13][14][15]\nOn June 30, 2011, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed as the Director of the CIA by the U.S. Senate 94\u20130.[16] Petraeus relinquished command of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan on July 18, 2011, and retired from the U.S. Army on August 31, 2011.[17] On November 9, 2012, he resigned from his position as director of the CIA, citing his extramarital affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, which was reportedly discovered in the course of an FBI investigation.[18][19] In January 2015, officials reported the FBI and Justice Department prosecutors had recommended bringing felony charges against Petraeus for allegedly providing classified information to Broadwell while serving as director of the CIA.[20] Eventually, Petraeus pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information.[21] He was later sentenced to two years of probation and fined $100,000 for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified material he gave to Broadwell.[22]\n\n\nEarly life and family[edit]\nPetraeus was born in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, the son of Miriam Sweet (n\u00e9e Howell; 1912\u20131991),[23] a librarian, and Sixtus Petraeus (1915\u20132008),[24] a sea captain. His father was a Dutch merchant mariner who emigrated to the United States at the start of World War II,[25] from Franeker, the Netherlands,[26][27] and his mother was American, a resident of Brooklyn, New York.[28] They met at the Seamen's Church Institute of New York and New Jersey and married. Sixtus Petraeus commanded a Liberty ship for the U.S. for the duration of World War II.[28] The family moved after the war, settling in Cornwall-on-Hudson, where David Petraeus grew up and graduated from Cornwall Central High School in 1970.\n\nWith his son Stephen, Afghanistan, 2010\nPetraeus went on to the United States Military Academy at West Point. Petraeus was on the intercollegiate soccer and ski teams, was a cadet captain on the brigade staff, and was a \"distinguished cadet\" academically, graduating in the top 5% of the Class of 1974 (ranked 40th overall). In the class yearbook, Petraeus was remembered as \"always going for it in sports, academics, leadership, and even his social life.\"[29]\nWhile a cadet, Petraeus started dating the daughter of Army General William A. Knowlton (the West Point superintendent at the time), Holly.[30][31] Two months after Petraeus graduated, they married.[32] Holly, who is multi-lingual, was a National Merit Scholar in high school, and graduated summa cum laude from Dickinson College. They have a daughter and son, Anne and Stephen. Petraeus administered the oath of office at his son's 2009 commissioning into the Army after his son's graduation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[33][34] His son went on to serve as an officer in Afghanistan as a member of 3rd Platoon, Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team.[35]\nPetraeus's official residence in the United States is a small property in the small town of Springfield, New Hampshire, which his wife inherited from her family.[36] Petraeus once told a friend that he was a Rockefeller Republican.[1]\n\nEducation and academia[edit]\nPetraeus graduated from West Point in 1974, receiving a B.S. degree in Military Science. He earned the General George C. Marshall Award as the top graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College Class of 1983 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He subsequently earned an M.P.A. degree in 1985 and a Ph.D. in international relations in 1987 from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, where he was mentored by Richard H. Ullman.[37]\nAt that time, he also served as an assistant professor of international relations at the U.S. Military Academy from 1985 to 1987. His doctoral dissertation was titled \"The American Military and the Lessons of Vietnam: A Study of Military Influence and the Use of Force in the Post-Vietnam Era\".[38] He completed a military fellowship at Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in 1994\u20131995,[39] although he was called away early to serve in Haiti as the Chief of Operations for NATO there in early 1995.[citation needed]\nFrom late 2005 through February 2007,[40] Petraeus served as commanding general of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center (CAC) located there. As commander of CAC, Petraeus was responsible for oversight of the Command and General Staff College and seventeen other schools, centers, and training programs as well as for developing the Army's doctrinal manuals, training the Army's officers, and supervising the Army's center for the collection and dissemination of lessons learned. During his time at CAC, Petraeus and Marine Lt. Gen. James F. Amos jointly oversaw the publication of Field Manual 3\u201324, Counterinsurgency, the body of which was written by an extraordinarily diverse group of military officers, academics, human rights advocates, and journalists who had been assembled by Petraeus and Amos.[41][42]\nAt both Fort Leavenworth and throughout the military's schools and training programs, Petraeus integrated the study of counterinsurgency into lesson plans and training exercises. In recognition of the fact that soldiers in Iraq often performed duties far different from those for which they trained, Petraeus stressed the importance of teaching soldiers how to think and how to fight, and the need to foster flexibility and adaptability in leaders.[43][44]\nPetraeus called this change the most significant part of The Surge, saying in 2016, \"the surge that mattered most was the surge of ideas. It was the change of strategy, and in many respects, this represented quite a significant change to what it was we were doing before the surge.\"[45] Petraeus has been called \"the world's leading expert in counter-insurgency warfare\".[46] Later, having refined his ideas on counterinsurgency based on the implementation of the new counterinsurgency doctrine in Iraq, he published both in Iraq as well as in the Sep/Oct 2008 edition of Military Review his \"Commander's Counterinsurgency Guidance\" to help guide leaders and units in the Multi-National Force-Iraq.[47]\n\nMilitary operations[edit]\nU.S. Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, during his time in the Army\n1970s[edit]\nUpon his graduation from West Point in 1974, Petraeus was commissioned an infantry officer. After completing Ranger School (Distinguished Honor Graduate and other honors), Petraeus was assigned to the 509th Airborne Battalion Combat Team, a light infantry unit stationed in Vicenza, Italy.[48] Ever since, light infantry has been at the core of his career, punctuated by assignments to mechanized units, unit commands, staff assignments, and educational institutions. After leaving the 509th as a first lieutenant,[49] Petraeus began a brief association with mechanized units when he became assistant operations officer on the staff of the 2nd Brigade, 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized), at Fort Stewart, Georgia. In 1979, he assumed command of a company in the same division: A Company, 2nd Battalion, 19th Infantry Regiment (Mechanized), and then served as that battalion's operations officer, a major's position that he held as a junior captain.\n\n1980s[edit]\nIn 1981, Petraeus became aide-de-camp to General John Galvin, then commanding general of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized).[50] He spent the next few years furthering his military and civilian education, including spending 1982\u201383 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, attending the Command and General Staff College. At graduation in 1983, he was the General George C. Marshall Award winner as the top graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. From 1983 to 1985, he was at Princeton; and 1985\u201387 at West Point.\nAfter earning his Ph.D. and teaching at West Point, Petraeus continued up the rungs of the command ladder, serving as military assistant to Gen. John Galvin, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. From there, he moved to the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized). During 1988\u20131989, he served as operations officer to the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized)'s 30th Infantry Regiment. He was then posted as an aide and assistant executive officer to the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, General Carl Vuono, in Washington, D.C.\n\n1990s[edit]\nUpon promotion to lieutenant colonel, Petraeus moved from the office of the chief of staff to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where he commanded the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)'s 3rd Battalion 187th Infantry Regiment, known as the \"Iron Rakkasans\",[citation needed] from 1991 to 1993. During this period, he suffered one of the more dramatic incidents in his career; in 1991 he was accidentally shot in the chest with an M-16 rifle during a live-fire exercise when a soldier tripped and his rifle discharged.[51] He was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, where he was operated on by future U.S. Senator Bill Frist. The hospital released him early after he did fifty push-ups without resting, just a few days after the accident.[52][53]\nDuring 1993\u201394, Petraeus continued his long association with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) as the division's assistant chief of staff, G-3 (plans, operations, and training) and installation director of plans, training, and mobilization (DPTM). In 1995, he was assigned to the United Nations Mission in Haiti Military Staff as its chief operations officer during Operation Uphold Democracy. His next command, from 1995 to 1997, was the 1st Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division, centered on the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment. At that post, his brigade's training cycle at Fort Polk's Joint Readiness Training Center for low-intensity warfare was chronicled by novelist and military enthusiast Tom Clancy in his book Airborne.[54]\nFrom 1997 to 1999, Petraeus served in the Pentagon as executive assistant to the director of the Joint Staff and then to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Henry Shelton, who described Petraeus as \"a high-energy individual who likes to lead from the front, in any field, he is going into.\"[54] In 1999, as a brigadier general, Petraeus returned to the 82nd, serving as the assistant division commander for operations and then, briefly, as acting commanding general. During his time with the 82nd, he deployed to Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Spring, the continuous rotation of combat forces through Kuwait during the decade after the Gulf War.\n\n2000s[edit]\nFrom the 82nd, he moved on to serve as chief of staff of XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg during 2000\u20132001. In 2000, Petraeus suffered his second major injury, when, during a civilian skydiving jump, his parachute collapsed at low altitude due to a hook turn, resulting in a hard landing that broke his pelvis. He was selected for promotion to major general in 2001.[55] During 2001\u20132002, as a brigadier general, Petraeus served a ten-month tour in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of Operation Joint Forge. In Bosnia, he was the NATO Stabilization Force assistant chief of staff for operations as well as the deputy commander of the U.S. Joint Interagency Counter-Terrorism Task Force, a command created after the September 11 attacks to add counterterrorism capability to the U.S. forces attached to the NATO command in Bosnia. In 2004, he was promoted to lieutenant general.[56]\nIn 2007, he was promoted to General.[57] On April 23, 2008, Secretary of Defense Gates announced that President Bush was nominating General Petraeus to command U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), headquartered in Tampa, Florida. In 2010, Petraeus was nominated to command the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, which required Senate confirmation.[58] He was confirmed on June 30, 2010,[59] and took over command from temporary commander Lieutenant-General Sir Nick Parker on July 4, 2010.[60]\n\nInvolvement in the Iraq War[edit]\n101st Airborne Division[edit]\nMaj. Gen. David H. Petraeus (right), commanding general, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), looks on as Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace, V Corps commanding general speaks to soldiers, March 21, 2003, Kuwait.\nIn 2003, Petraeus, then a major general, saw combat for the first time when he commanded the 101st Airborne Division during V Corps's drive to Baghdad. In a campaign chronicled in detail by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Rick Atkinson of The Washington Post in the book In the Company of Soldiers, Petraeus led his division through fierce fighting south of Baghdad, in Karbala, Hilla and Najaf. Following the fall of Baghdad, the division conducted the longest heliborne assault on record in order to reach Nineveh Governorate, where it would spend much of 2003. The 1st Brigade was responsible for the area south of Mosul, the 2nd Brigade for the city itself, and the 3rd Brigade for the region stretching toward the Syrian border. An often-repeated story of Petraeus's time with the 101st is his asking of embedded The Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to \"Tell me how this ends\",[61] an anecdote he and other journalists have used to portray Petraeus as an early recognizer of the difficulties that would follow the fall of Baghdad.[50][62][63][64][65][66]\nIn Mosul, a city of nearly two million people, Petraeus and the 101st employed classic counterinsurgency methods to build security and stability, including conducting targeted kinetic operations and using force judiciously, jump-starting the economy, building local security forces, staging elections for the city council within weeks of their arrival, overseeing a program of public works, reinvigorating the political process,[67][68][69] and launching 4,500 reconstruction projects in Iraq.[70]\nThis approach can be attributed to Petraeus, who had been steeped in nation-building during his previous tours in nations such as Bosnia and Haiti and thus approached nation-building as a central military mission and who was \"prepared to act while the civilian authority in Baghdad was still getting organized\", according to Michael Gordon of The New York Times.[71] Some Iraqis gave Petraeus the nickname 'King David',[67][72] which was later adopted by some of his colleagues.[73][74][75] In 2004, Newsweek stated that \"It's widely accepted that no force worked harder to win Iraqi hearts and minds than the 101st Airborne Division led by Petraeus.\"[76]\n\nPetraeus on patrol in Mosul with Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, 2003\nOne of the General's major public works was the restoration and re-opening of the University of Mosul.[77][78] Petraeus strongly supported the use of commanders' discretionary funds for public works, telling Coalition Provisional Authority director L. Paul Bremer \"Money is ammunition\" during the director's first visit to Mosul.[79][80] Petraeus's often repeated[81] catchphrase was later incorporated into official military briefings[82][83] and was also eventually incorporated into the U.S. Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted with Petraeus's oversight.[84]\n\nPetraeus's Bronze Star Medal with V Device for actions in combat leading the 101st Airborne (Air Assault) Division during Operation Iraqi Freedom, May 2003\nIn February 2004, the 101st was replaced in Mosul by a portion of I Corps headquarters, but operational forces consisted solely of a unit roughly one quarter its size\u2014a Stryker brigade. The following summer, the governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated, and most of the Sunni Arab Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly Sunni Arab province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely Sunni Arab police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked Fallujah in November 2004.\n\nOrders awarding the Combat Action Badge to then LTG David H. Petraeus for actions in combat during Iraqi Freedom\nThere are differing explanations for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul. The Guardian quoted an anonymous U.S. diplomat saying, \"Mosul basically collapsed after he [Petraeus] left.\" Former diplomat Peter Galbraith criticized Petraeus's command of the 101st, saying his achievements had been exaggerated and his reputation inflated. He wrote for The New York Review of Books that \"Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing the wrong people to key positions in Mosul's local government and police.\"[85]\nOn the other hand, in the book Fiasco, The Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that \"Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had\u2014and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques.\" Ricks went on to say that \"the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006.\"[86]\nTime columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st \"didn't do any of the local governance that Petraeus had done.\" Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, \"they were occupiers, not builders\".[87] The New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus \"did it right and won over Mosul.\"[88]\n\nMulti-National Security Transition Command \u2013 Iraq[edit]\nIn June 2004, less than six months after the 101st returned to the U.S., Petraeus was promoted to lieutenant general and became the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq. This newly created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing army, police, and other security forces, as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts.[89]\nDuring Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II\", at a cost of over $11 billion.[89]\nIn September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses \u2013 not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"[90]\nSome of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency\u2014or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight\u2014and while being shot at.\" Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former Interim Iraq Governing Council member Ali A. Allawi in The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace, \"under the very noses of the security transition command, officials both inside and outside the ministry of defense were planning to embezzle most, if not all, of the procurement budget of the army.\"[91] The Washington Post stated in August 2007 that the Pentagon had lost track of approximately 30% of weapons supplied to the Iraqi security forces. The General Accounting Office said that the weapons distribution was haphazard, rushed, and did not follow established procedures\u2014particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by Petraeus and Iraq's security forces began to see combat in places like Najaf and Samarra.[92]\nOver a hundred thousand AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were delivered to Iraqi forces without full documentation, and some of the missing weapons may have been abducted by Iraqi insurgents.[93][94] Thousands of body armour pieces have also been lost.[95] The Independent has stated that the military believed \"the situation on the ground was so urgent, and the agency responsible for recording the transfers of arms so short-staffed, that field commanders had little choice in the matter.\"[96] The Pentagon conducted its own investigation, and accountability was subsequently regained for many of the weapons.[97]\nFollowing his second tour in Iraq, Petraeus authored a widely read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations he had made during two tours in Iraq, including: do not do too much with your own hands, money is ammunition, increasing the number of stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, there is no substitute for flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.[98]\n\nMulti-National Force \u2013 Iraq (spring 2007)[edit]\nPetraeus walking through a market in Baghdad, March 2007\nThe intervening time between the Iraq commands was spent at Fort Leavenworth, where Petraeus further developed his military doctrine and pursued an important White House contact in Meghan O'Sullivan who was the principal adviser to the president on the war.[99] In January 2007, as part of his overhauled Iraq strategy, President George W. Bush announced that Petraeus would succeed Gen. George Casey as commanding general of MNF-I to lead all U.S. troops in Iraq. In his memoirs, President Bush likened his selection of Petraeus to the elevations of other great generals of American history, writing, \"Lincoln discovered Generals Grant and Sherman.  Roosevelt had Eisenhower and Bradley.  I found David Petraeus and Ray Odierno.\"[100][101]\nOn January 23, the Senate Armed Services Committee held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort.\" He went on to state that security would require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.[102]\nThroughout Petraeus's tenure in Iraq, Multi-National Force-Iraq endeavored to work with the Government of Iraq to carry out this strategy that focused on securing the population. Doing so required establishing\u2014and maintaining\u2014persistent presence by living among the population, separating reconcilable Iraqis from irreconcilable enemies, relentlessly pursuing the enemy, taking back sanctuaries and then holding areas that had been cleared, and continuing to develop Iraq's security forces and to support local security forces, often called Sons of Iraq, and integrate them into the Iraqi Army and Police and other employment programs.[103][104]\nThe strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces, as well as the ideas Petraeus included in U.S. Army Field Manual 3\u201324, Counterinsurgency, have been referred to by some journalists and politicians as the \"Petraeus Doctrine\", although the surge itself was proposed a few months before Petraeus took command. Despite the misgivings of most Democratic and a few Republican senators over the proposed implementation of the \"Petraeus Doctrine\" in Iraq, specifically regarding the troop surge, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed as a four-star general and MNF-I commander on January 27.[105][106]\nBefore leaving for Iraq, Petraeus recruited a number of highly educated military officers, nicknamed \"Petraeus guys\" or \"designated thinkers\", to advise him as commander, including Col. Mike Meese, head of the Social Sciences Department at West Point and Col. H.R. McMaster, famous for his leadership at the Battle of 73 Easting in the Gulf War and in the pacification of Tal Afar more recently, as well as for his doctoral dissertation on Vietnam-era civil-military relations titled Dereliction of Duty. While most of Petraeus's closest advisers were American military officers, he also hired Lt. Col. David Kilcullen of the Australian Army, who was working for the U.S. State Department.[107] Kilcullen upon his return from Iraq published The Accidental Guerrilla,[108] and has discussed the central front of the war and lessons learned in Iraq in The Washington Post.[109]\n\nU.S. Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq, briefs reporters at the Pentagon April 26, 2007, on his view of the current military situation in Iraq.\nAfter taking command of MNF-I on February 10, 2007, Petraeus inspected U.S. and Iraqi units all over Iraq, visiting outposts in greater Baghdad, Tikrit, Baquba, Ramadi, Mosul, Kirkuk, Bayji, Samarra, Basrah and as far west as al-Hit and Al Qaim. In April 2007, Petraeus made his first visit to Washington as MNF-I Commander, reporting to President Bush and Congress on the progress of the \"surge\" and the overall situation in Iraq. During this visit he met privately with members of Congress and reportedly argued against setting a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq.[110]\nBy late May 2007, Congress had not imposed any timetables in war funding legislation for troop withdrawal.[111] The enacted legislation did mandate that Petraeus and the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, deliver a report to Congress by September 15, 2007, detailing their assessment of the military, economic and political situation of Iraq.\nIn June 2007, Petraeus stated in an interview that there were \"astonishing signs of normalcy\" in Baghdad, and this comment drew criticism from Senate majority leader Harry Reid. In the same interview, however, Petraeus stated that \"many problems remain\" and he noted the need to help the Iraqis \"stitch back together the fabric of society that was torn during the height of sectarian violence\" in late 2006.[112] Petraeus also warned that he expected that the situation in Iraq would require the continued deployment of the elevated troop level of more than 150,000 beyond September 2007; he also stated that U.S. involvement in Iraq could last years afterward.[113]\nThese statements are representative of the fact that throughout their time in Iraq, Petraeus and Crocker remained circumspect and refused to classify themselves as optimists or pessimists, noting, instead, that they were realists and that the reality in Iraq was very hard. They also repeatedly emphasized the importance of forthright reports and an unvarnished approach.[114][115] Indeed, Petraeus's realistic approach and assessments were lauded during the McLaughlin Group's 2008 Year-End Awards, when Monica Crowley nominated Petraeus for the most honest person of the year, stating, \"[H]e spoke about the great successes of the surge in Iraq, but he always tempered it, never sugar-coated it.\"[116]\n\nMulti-National Force \u2013 Iraq (summer and fall 2007)[edit]\nIn July 2007, the White House submitted to Congress the interim report on Iraq, which stated that coalition forces had made satisfactory progress on 6 of 18 benchmarks set by Congress. On September 7, 2007, in a letter addressed to the troops he was commanding, Petraeus wrote that much military progress had been made, but that the national-level political progress that was hoped for had not been achieved.[117] Petraeus's Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq was delivered to Congress on September 10, 2007.\nOn August 15, 2007, the Los Angeles Times had stated that, according to unnamed administration officials, the report \"would actually be written by the White House, with inputs from officials throughout the government.\"[118] However, Petraeus declared in his testimony to Congress that \"I wrote this testimony myself.\" He further elaborated that his testimony to Congress \"has not been cleared by, nor shared with, anyone in the Pentagon, the White House, or Congress.\"[119]\n\nGEN Petraeus with LTG Odierno (left), President Bush (center), SecDef Gates, and SecState Rice (right) at Al Asad Airbase in September 2007\nIn his September Congressional testimony, Petraeus stated, \"As a bottom line up front, the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met.\" He cited numerous factors for this progress, to include the fact that Coalition and Iraqi Forces had dealt significant blows to Al-Qaeda Iraq and had disrupted Shia militias, that ethno-sectarian violence had been reduced, and that the tribal rejection of Al-Qaeda had spread from Anbar Province to numerous other locations across Iraq. Based on this progress and additional progress expected to be achieved, Petraeus recommended drawing down the surge forces from Iraq and gradually transitioning increased responsibilities to Iraqi Forces, as their capabilities and conditions on the ground permitted.[120]\nDemocratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada argued Petraeus's \"plan is just more of the same\" and \"is neither a drawdown or a change in mission that we need.\" Democratic Representative Robert Wexler of Florida accused Petraeus of \"cherry-picking statistics\" and \"massaging information\".[121] Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Lantos of California called Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker \"two of our nation's most capable public servants\" and said Democrats feel \"esteem for their professionalism.\" But he also said that \"We can no longer take their assertions on Iraq at face value\"; concluding, \"We need to get out of Iraq, for that country's sake as well as our own.\"[122]\nRepublican Presidential candidate Duncan Hunter called the report \"a candid, independent assessment given with integrity.\"[123] Republican senator Jon Kyl of Arizona stated, \"I commend General Petraeus for his honest and forthright assessment of the situation in Iraq.\"[124] Anti-war Republican senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska criticized the report while praising Petraeus, saying \"It's not your fault, general.\u00a0... It's not Ambassador Crocker's fault. It's this administration's fault.\"[125] A USA Today/Gallup poll taken after Petraeus's report to Congress showed virtually no change in negative public opinion toward the war.[126] A Pew Research Center survey, however, found that most Americans who had heard about the report approved of Petraeus's recommendations.[127]\nOn September 20, the Senate passed an amendment by Republican John Cornyn III of Texas designed to \"strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus.\" Cornyn drafted the amendment in response to a controversial full-page ad by the liberal group Moveon.org in the September 10, 2007, edition of The New York Times. All forty-nine Republican senators and twenty-two Democratic senators voted in support.[128] The House passed a similar resolution by a 341\u201379 vote on September 26.\nIn December 2007, The Washington Post's \"Fact Checker\" stated that \"While some of Petraeus's statistics are open to challenge, his claims about a general reduction in violence have been borne out over subsequent months. It now looks as if Petraeus was broadly right on this issue at least.\"[129]\nBased on the conditions on the ground, in October 2007, Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker revised their campaign plan for Iraq. In recognition of the progress made against Al Qaeda Iraq, one of the major points would be \"shifting the U.S. military effort to focus more on countering Shiite militias.\"[130]\n\nMulti-National Force \u2013 Iraq (spring 2008)[edit]\nOn February 18, 2008, USA Today stated that \"the U.S. effort has shown more success\" and that, after the number of troops reached its peak in fall 2007, \"U.S. deaths were at their lowest levels since the 2003 invasion, civilian casualties were down, and street life was resuming in Baghdad.\"[131] In light of the significant reduction in violence and as the surge brigades began to redeploy without replacement, Petraeus characterized the progress as tenuous, fragile, and reversible and repeatedly reminded all involved that much work remained to be done.[132][133] During an early February trip to Iraq, Defense Secretary Robert Gates endorsed the idea of a period of consolidation and evaluation upon completion of the withdrawal of surge brigades from Iraq.[134]\nPetraeus and Crocker continued these themes at their two full days of testimony before Congress on April 8 and 9. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"there has been significant but uneven security progress in Iraq\", while also noting that \"the situation in certain areas is still unsatisfactory and that innumerable challenges remain\" and that \"the progress made since last spring is fragile and reversible.\" He also recommended a continuation of the drawdown of surge forces as well as a 45-day period of consolidation and evaluation after the final surge brigade had redeployed in late July.[119] Analysts for USA Today and The New York Times stated that the hearings \"lacked the suspense of last September's debate,\" but they did include sharp questioning as well as both skepticism and praise from various Congressional leaders.[135][136]\nIn late May 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee held nomination hearings for Petraeus and Lieutenant General Ray Odierno to lead United States Central Command and Multi-National Force-Iraq, respectively. During the hearings, Committee Chairman Carl Levin praised these two men, stating that \"we owe Gen. Petraeus and Gen. Odierno a debt of gratitude for the commitment, determination and strength that they brought to their areas of responsibility. And regardless of how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, our troops are better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide.\"[137]\nDuring his opening statement, Petraeus discussed four principles that would guide his efforts if confirmed as CENTCOM Commander: seeking to strengthen international partnerships; taking a \"whole of government\" approach; pursuing comprehensive efforts and solutions; and, finally, both supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and ensuring readiness for possible contingency operations in the future. Petraeus also noted that during the week before his testimony, the number of security incidents in Iraq was the lowest in over four years.[138] After Petraeus's return to Baghdad, and despite the continued drawdown of surge forces as well as recent Iraqi-led operations in places like Basrah, Mosul, and Baghdad, the number of security incidents in Iraq remained at their lowest level in over four years.[139]\n\nMulti-National Force \u2013 Iraq (summer and fall 2008)[edit]\nPetraeus explains security improvements in Sadr City while giving an aerial tour of Baghdad to Senator Barack Obama, July 2008\nIn September 2008, Petraeus gave an interview to BBC News stating that he did not think using the term \"victory\" in describing the Iraq war was appropriate, saying \"This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade\u00a0... it's not war with a simple slogan.\"[140]\nPetraeus had discussed the term 'victory' before in March 2008, saying to NPR News that \"an Iraq that is at peace with itself, at peace with its neighbors, that has a government that is representative of\u2014and responsive to\u2014its citizenry and is a contributing member of the global community\" could arguably be called 'victory'.[141] On the eve of his change of command, in September 2008, Petraeus stated that \"I don't use terms like victory or defeat\u00a0... I'm a realist, not an optimist or a pessimist. And the reality is that there has been significant progress but there are still serious challenges.\"[142]\n\nChange of command[edit]\nIraq Defense Minister Abdul Qadir presents a gift to Petraeus during a farewell ceremony in Baghdad in September 2008.\nOn September 16, 2008, Petraeus formally gave over his command in Iraq to General Raymond T. Odierno in a government ceremony presided by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[142] During the ceremony, Gates stated that Petraeus \"played a historic role\" and created the \"translation of a great strategy into a great success in very difficult circumstances.\" Gates also told Petraeus he believed \"history will regard you as one of our nation's greatest battle captains.\"[142] He presented Petraeus with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.[142] At the event, Petraeus mentioned the difficulty in getting the Sons of Iraq absorbed into the central Government of Iraq and warned about future consequences if the effort stalled.[142]\nWhen speaking of these and other challenges, Petraeus noted that \"the gains [achieved in Iraq] are tenuous and unlikely to survive without an American effort that outlasts his tenure.\" Even so, as Petraeus departed Iraq, it appeared to many that he was leaving a much different Iraq than the one that existed when he took command in February 2007. As described by Dexter Filkins, \"violence has plummeted from its apocalyptic peaks, Iraqi leaders are asserting themselves, and streets that once seemed dead are flourishing with life.\"[143] The January 3, 2009, Iraq Trends (a chart produced weekly by the MNF-I) seemed to illustrate an increase in incidents followed by the sharp decline described by Dexter Filkens and others.\nPetraeus' command of coalition forces during the Surge in Iraq was lauded by a number of observers. In his book The Savior Generals historian Victor Davis Hanson wrote, \"that without David Petraeus, the American effort in Iraq\u2014along with the reputation of the U.S. military in the Middle East\u2014would have been lost long ago.\"[144] In her introduction of Petraeus at the Baccalaureate ceremony for the Class of 2009 at Princeton University, President Shirley Tilghman described his accomplishments. While acknowledging that much remained to be accomplished in Iraq, Tilghman paid tribute to Petraeus's \"leadership in rethinking American military strategy through his principles of counterinsurgency,\" which are, she said, \"eliminating 'simplistic definitions of victory and defeat in favor of incremental and nuanced progress.'\"[145]\n\nU.S. Central Command (fall 2008 to summer 2010)[edit]\nGen. David H. Petraeus speaking at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College\nOn October 31, 2008, Petraeus assumed command of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) headquartered in Tampa, Florida. Petraeus was responsible for U.S. operations in 20 countries spreading from Egypt to Pakistan\u2014including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. During his time at CENTCOM, Petraeus advocated that countering the terrorist threats in the CENTCOM region required more than just counter-terrorism forces, demanding instead whole-of-government, comprehensive approaches akin to those of counterinsurgency.[146] One of his closest colleagues said that Petraeus knew that defeating an insurgency required living among the people, convincing them that we were better than the insurgents.  \"[Y]ou can't kill 'em all\u00a0... [Y]ou can't kill your way out of an insurgency.\u00a0... You have to find other kinds of ammunition, and it's not always a bullet.\"[147]\nPetraeus reiterated this view in a 2009 interview published in Parade magazine.[148] In an interview for Newsweek magazine's \"Interview Issue: The View From People Who Make a Difference,\" Petraeus expressed his support for President Obama's announced Afghanistan strategy and discussed his view that reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan should for the time being occur \"at the lower and midlevels.\"[149]\nIn mid-August 2009, Petraeus established the Afghanistan-Pakistan Center of Excellence within the USCENTCOM Directorate of Intelligence to provide leadership to coordinate, integrate and focus analysis efforts in support of operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.[150]\nDuring a February 2010 World Affairs Council event in Philadelphia, General Petraeus discussed the ways in which diplomacy, history, and culture impact overall military strategy, then explained how these issues informed the U.S. approach to counterinsurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan.[151]\nOn March 16, 2010, in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Petraeus described the continuing Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict as a challenge to U.S. interests in the region. According to the testimony, the conflict was \"fomenting anti-American sentiment\" due to \"a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel.\" This was widely commented on in the media.[152][153][154][155] When questioned by journalist Philip Klein, Petraeus said the original reporter \"picked apart\" and \"spun\" his speech. He said he believed there were many important factors standing in the way of peace, including \"a whole bunch of extremist organizations, some of which by the way deny Israel's right to exist. There's a country that has a nuclear program who denies that the Holocaust took place. So again we have all these factors in there. This [Israel] is just one.\"[156][157]\nIn March 2010, Petraeus visited the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College to speak about Iraq and Afghanistan.[158] Petraeus spoke a few days after the seventh anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, noting the successful changes in Iraq since the U.S. troop surge. The visit to Saint Anselm created rumors that Petraeus was contemplating a run for the presidency; however, he denied the speculation, saying that he was not aware that the college had been the site of numerous presidential debates.[159]\nToward the close of his tenure as CENTCOM Commander, including in his interview published in Vanity Fair, Petraeus discussed the effort to determine and send to Afghanistan the right \"inputs\" for success there; these inputs included several structures and organizations that proved important in Iraq, including \"an engagement cell to support reconciliation\u00a0... a finance cell to go after financing of the enemy\u00a0... [a] really robust detainee-operations task force, a rule-of-law task force, an energy-fusion cell\u2014all these other sort of nonstandard missions that are very important.\"[160]\nOn May 5, 2010, The New York Times published an article suggesting there was mounting evidence of a Taliban role in the Times Square bombing plot.[161] On May 7, 2010, Petraeus announced that Times Square bombing suspect Faisal Shahzad was a \"lone wolf\" terrorist who did not work with others.[162] On May 10, 2010, Attorney General Eric Holder said that the evidence showed the Pakistani Taliban directed this plot.[163]\n\nHealth[edit]\nGeneral Petraeus was diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer in February 2009 and underwent two months of successful radiation treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.[164] The diagnosis and treatment were not publicly disclosed until October 2009 because Petraeus and his family regarded his illness as a personal matter that did not interfere with the performance of his duties.[165]\nOn June 15, 2010, Petraeus momentarily fainted while being questioned by the Senate Armed Services Committee. He quickly recovered and was able to walk and exit the room without assistance.[166] He attributed the episode to possible dehydration.\n\nCommander of U.S. and ISAF forces in Afghanistan (2010-2011)[edit]\nPetraeus having tea with the Afghan Border Police Commander at the border with Uzbekistan\nOn June 23, 2010, President Obama announced that he would nominate Petraeus to succeed General Stanley A. McChrystal as the commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. The change of command was prompted by McChrystal's comments about the Obama administration and its policies in Afghanistan during an interview with Rolling Stone magazine.[14] The nomination was technically a positional step down from his position as commander of Central Command; however, the President said that he believed that he was the best man for the job. After being confirmed by the Senate on June 30,[59] Petraeus formally assumed command on July 4.[167]\nDuring the assumption-of-command remarks,[168] Petraeus provided his vision and goals to NATO, the members of his command, and his Afghan partners. As he was known to do while the commander in Iraq, Petraeus delivered his first Letter to the Troops[169] on the same day he assumed command.[170]\nIn December, 2009, then President Obama announced that there would be a 30,000 troop surge in Afghanistan, but that in 18 months there would be a troop drawdown to take these forces out of the country again. Petraeus later shared his surprise at this decision, noting that he didn't agree with the choice to announce a drawdown given that it limited bargaining power with the enemy.[171]\nOn August 1, 2010, shortly after the disclosure of the Afghan war logs on WikiLeaks, which included reports of high civilian deaths and increased Taliban attacks, Petraeus issued his updated Tactical Directive for the prevention of civilian casualties, providing guidance and intent for the use of force by the U.S. military units operating in Afghanistan (replacing the July 1, 2009, version). This directive reinforced the concept of \"disciplined use of force in partnership with Afghan Security Forces\" in the fight against insurgent forces.\n\nWe must never forget that the center of gravity in this struggle is the Afghan people; it is they who will ultimately determine the future of Afghanistan\u00a0... Prior to the use of fires, the commander approving the strike must determine that no civilians are present. If unable to assess the risk of civilian presence, fires are prohibited, except under of the following two conditions (specific conditions deleted due to operational security; however, they have to do with the risk to ISAF and Afghan forces).[172]\nIn the October 2010 issue of Army Magazine, Petraeus discussed changes that had taken place over the previous 18 months, including sections discussing \"setting the conditions for progress,\" \"capitalizing on the conditions for progress,\" \"improving security,\" \"supporting governance expansion,\" \"promoting economic development,\" \"reducing corruption,\" and \"our troopers: carrying out a difficult mission.\"[173]\n\nPetraeus talks with U.S. soldiers at Combat Outpost Monti in eastern Afghanistan in August 2010.\nPetraeus visits Regional Command West in Afghanistan, May 2011.\nSources interviewed by Steve Coll were critical of aspects of Petraeus's tenure as ISAF commander. Some described Petraeus as being physically exhausted from his previous tours abroad (as well as his recovery from prostate cancer), having a proclivity to see Afghanistan through the prism of his experience in Iraq\u2014to the point of occasionally referring to Afghanistan as \"Iraq\"\u2014and being slow to react to \"green-on-blue\" or \"insider attacks\" by Afghan soldiers against their American partners. Petraeus sought to recreate the \"Sunni Awakening\" in Iraq by offering financial inducements to former Taliban insurgents to integrate into Hamid Karzai's government, but the results were not impressive.[174]\nAs commander in Afghanistan, Petraeus joined President Obama as a primary target for Osama bin Laden. After his death, documents recovered from bin Laden's compound unveiled a plot to assassinate the two men as they traveled by plane. Bin Laden's communications with a top deputy stated, \"The reason for concentrating on them is that Obama is the head of infidelity and killing him automatically will make [Vice President] Biden take over the presidency. Biden is totally unprepared for that post, which will lead the U.S. into a crisis. As for Petraeus, he is the man of the hour\u00a0... and killing him would alter the war's path\" in Afghanistan.[175][176]\nIn early March 2011, Petraeus made a \"rare apology\" following a NATO helicopter airstrike under his command that resulted in the deaths of nine Afghan boys and the wounding of a 10th, as they gathered firewood in Eastern Afghanistan. In a statement, Petraeus apologized to the members of the Afghan government, the people of Afghanistan, and the surviving family members, and said, \"These deaths should have never happened.\" Several journalists and observers noted the humanitarian candor in Petraeus's open regrets.[177][178] Petraeus relinquished command of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan on July 18, 2011.[179] He received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal and the NATO Meritorious Service Medal for his service.\n\nRetirement from the U.S. Army (August 2011)[edit]\nPetraeus retired from the U.S. Army on August 31, 2011. His retirement ceremony was held at Joint Base Myer\u2013Henderson Hall.[180][181] During this ceremony, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal by Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn.[182] During the ceremony, Lynn noted that Petraeus had played an important role as both a combat leader and strategist in the post-9/11 world. Lynn also cited General Petraeus's efforts in current counter insurgency strategy.[183]\nAdmiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in his remarks compared General Petraeus to Ulysses S. Grant, John J. Pershing, George Marshall and Dwight D. Eisenhower as one of the great battle captains of American history.[184] With his four-star rank, Petraeus receives an annual pension of about $220,000.[185]\n\nDates of rank[edit]\n\nPromotions\n\n\nRank\nDate\n\n\n Second lieutenant\nJune 5, 1974[186]\n\n\n First lieutenant\nJune 5, 1976[186]\n\n\n Captain\nAugust 8, 1978[186]\n\n\n Major\nAugust 1, 1985[186]\n\n\n Lieutenant colonel\nApril 1, 1991[186]\n\n\n Colonel\nSeptember 1, 1995[186]\n\n\n Brigadier general\nJanuary 1, 2000[186]\n\n\n Major general\nJanuary 1, 2003[186]\n\n\n Lieutenant general\nMay 18, 2004[186]\n\n\n General\nFebruary 10, 2007[186]\n\nCIA Director (September 2011 \u2013 November 2012)[edit]\nPetraeus sworn in at the CIA Headquarters as his wife, Holly, looks on\nOn April 28, 2011, President Barack Obama announced that he had nominated Petraeus to become the new Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[187] The nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate 94\u20130 on June 30, 2011.[188] Petraeus was sworn in at the White House on September 6[189] and then ceremonially sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia on October 11, 2011.[190]\nPetraeus's tenure at the CIA was more low profile than that of his predecessor, Leon Panetta, declining to give media interviews while director and speaking to Congress in closed sessions. He also differed from Panetta in management style, as an article in The New York Times published just days before his resignation said; Panetta \"wooed the work force and often did not question operational details, [while] Petraeus is a demanding boss who does not hesitate to order substandard work redone or details of plans adjusted\".[191] Petraeus's philosophy on leadership at the time was summarized in a twelve-point article published by Newsweek on November 5, 2012.[192]\nAlthough Petraeus was given good marks by most observers for his work heading the CIA,[191] during October 2012 some critics took issue with the availability of accurate information from the CIA concerning an attack in Benghazi, Libya, the month prior. On September 11 four Americans had been killed, including the ambassador, and more than thirty evacuated. Only seven of those evacuated did not work for the CIA. According to a Wall Street Journal story, other government agencies complained about being left \"largely in the dark about the CIA's role,\" with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton telephoning Petraeus directly the night of the attacks seeking assistance. Although the \"State Department believed it had a formal agreement with the CIA to provide backup security,\" \"the CIA didn't have the same understanding about its security responsibilities,\" reported The Wall Street Journal.[193]\n\nExtramarital affair, resignation and criticism[edit]\nMain article: Petraeus scandal\nPetraeus with Paula Broadwell in July 2011\nPetraeus reportedly began an affair with Paula Broadwell, principal author of his biography, All In: The Education of General David Petraeus, after Petraeus left his ISAF command on July 18, 2011, to become CIA director. Petraeus reportedly ended the affair in the summer of 2012, around the time that he learned that Broadwell had been sending harassing emails to a longstanding family friend of the Petraeuses, Jill Kelley.[194]\nKelley, a Florida socialite who frequently entertained senior military personnel at her and her husband's Tampa mansion,[195] had approached an acquaintance who worked for the FBI Tampa Field Office in the late spring with regard to anonymous emails she considered threatening.[194] The Bureau traced the emails to Broadwell, and noted that Broadwell appeared to be exchanging intimate messages with an email account belonging to Petraeus, which instigated an investigation into whether that account had been hacked into or was someone posing as Petraeus.[196][197][198] According to an Associated Press report, rather than transmit emails to each other's inbox, which would have left a more obvious email trail, Petraeus and Broadwell left messages in a draft folder and the draft messages were then read by the other person when they logged into the same account.[199]\nAlthough U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was aware that the FBI had discovered the affair,[200] it was not until November 6, 2012, that Petraeus's nominal superior, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, was advised. That same evening Clapper called Petraeus and urged him to resign. Clapper notified the White House the next day, November 7. After being briefed on November 8, President Obama summoned Petraeus to the White House where Petraeus offered his resignation.[201] Obama accepted his resignation on November 9,[202] and Petraeus cited his affair when announcing that same day that he would resign as CIA Director.[203] Eventually, Petraeus pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling the classified information that he provided to his mistress and biographer.[21]\n\nCriticism after 2012 scandal[edit]\nOn November 13, 2012, Reagan administration Assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence Korb, CIA analyst and Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity co-founder Ray McGovern, and investigative journalist Gareth Porter appeared on Al Jazeera English. Together they assessed the general's extensive military-media strategy, linking his writings on counterguerrilla operations and subsequent military media efforts to his downfall with his female biographer. Critics said that the Petraeus media strategy would prove damaging for American policy in the future because of omissions and distorted interpretations that Washington policymakers, other experts, and the American public accepted from Petraeus's media contacts.[204]\nMilitary historians have noted the absence of field records for the Iraq and Afghanistan military campaigns, but have not been personally critical of the commanders in theater.[205] One additional aspect of Petraeus's career that has come under increased scrutiny since his affair came to light has been his lack of a direct combat record in relation to the many awards he received. In particular, his Bronze Star Medal with Valor device has been mentioned in several media reports and questioned by several former Army officers.[206] The citation for Petraeus's Bronze Star with \"V\" device also notes his \"leadership under fire\", as does award of the Combat Action Badge, but neither provides a detailed account of his actions.\n\nCriminal charges and probation[edit]\nIn January 2015, The New York Times reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department had recommended bringing felony charges against Petraeus for providing classified information to Broadwell. Petraeus denied the allegations and was reported to have had no interest in a plea deal.[20] However, on Tuesday, March 3, 2015, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Petraeus agreed to plead guilty in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina to a charge of unauthorized removal and retention of classified information.[207]\nIn the 15-page statement of facts filed by the government along with the plea agreement, the government stated that Petraeus had provided Broadwell access to documents containing Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information, had later moved those documents to his personal residence and stored them in an unsecured drawer, and had deliberately and intentionally lied to Federal investigators about both providing Broadwell access to the documents and their improper storage. These facts were acknowledged to be true by Petraeus as part of his plea agreement.[208]\nOn April 23, 2015, a federal judge sentenced Petraeus to two years' probation plus a fine of $100,000. The fine was more than double the amount the Justice Department had requested.[209]\nPress accounts in January 2016 indicated that Department of Defense staff were reviewing Department of Justice documents from the Petraeus prosecution and considering whether to recommend to the Secretary of Defense that Petraeus be demoted on the Army's retired list. Laws and regulations indicate that members of the military are retired at the last rank in which they are deemed to have served successfully; Petraeus's admission of an extramarital affair and guilty plea with regard to removing and retaining classified information while serving in the grade of general could be grounds for reduction in rank to lieutenant general. The matter was reviewed by then-Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh before he left office in October 2015; he recommended no further action.[210] On January 29, press accounts indicated that Stephen C. Hedger, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, had written to the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. In his letter, Hedger informed the committee that Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter had concurred with the Army's recommendation, and would not impose any further punishment on Petraeus.[211]\n\nActivities in retirement[edit]\nIn March 2013, Petraeus accepted the role of honorary chairman of the OSS Society.[212]\nPetraeus was named a visiting professor at Macaulay Honors College at the City University of New York in July 2013. According to a statement from Petraeus, \"I look forward to leading a seminar at Macaulay that examines the developments that could position the United States\u2014and our North American partners\u2014to lead the world out of the current global economic slowdown.\"[213] After his anticipated $200,000 salary for the academic year drew fire from critics, Petraeus agreed to take on the teaching position for just $1 in order to keep the focus on the students and away from any monetary controversy.[214] In September 2013 Petraeus was harassed by students at CUNY while walking on campus.[215]\nOn May 1, 2013, the University of Southern California named David Petraeus as a Judge Widney Professor, \"a title reserved for eminent individuals from the arts, sciences, professions, business and community and national leadership\".[216] The president of the Currahee board of trustees announced May 6, 2013, that Petraeus agreed to serve on the board of trustees that preserves Camp Toccoa. During WWII, four of the main parachute infantry regiments of the Army trained at Camp Toccoa prior to their deployment.[217]\nKohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., a New York investment firm, hired Petraeus as chairman of the firm's newly created KKR Global Institute in May 2013. Part of his work would support KKR's investment teams and portfolio companies when studying new investments, especially in new locations.[218] In December 2014, Petraeus was named a partner at KKR and remains chairman of the KKR Global Institute.[219]\nPetraeus joined the board of advisers of Team Rubicon on June 18, 2013.[220]\nRoyal United Services Institute (RUSI) named Petraeus as a senior vice president of the organization in August 2013. According to RUSI, \"The honorary role was created by RUSI's trustees and advisory council in recognition of General Petraeus's long association with the Institute and his distinguished contribution to the study and development of defence and international security concepts, as well as his implementation of those concepts in operations in the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\"[221]\nIn October 2013, Petraeus joined Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government as a non-resident senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. According to the school, Petraeus joined to lead a new project focusing on the technological, scientific and economic dynamics that are spurring renewed North American competitiveness. \"The Coming North America Decades\" project would analyze how potential policy choices could effect this ongoing transformation.[222]  In 2016, the center announced a new project involving Petraeus and focusing on strategic leadership.[223]\nOn February 10, 2014, the University of Exeter in England named Petraeus as an honorary visiting professor of the Strategy and Security Institute. Alongside the other honorary faculty, the appointment would help inform the institute's key objectives of exploring policymaking, strategy, and security.[224]\nGeneral Petraeus was one of the \"11 legendary generals\" profiled in the 2014 National Geographic Channel feature \"American War Generals\".[225]\nIn 2015, Petraeus suggested the U.S. should arm members of the terror group Al-Nusra Front (an offshoot of Al-Qaeda) in Syria to fight ISIS.[226]\nOn June 10, 2016, Petraeus and Mark Kelly, a retired NASA astronaut and later senator from Arizona, announced the creation of the now defunct gun control group Veterans Coalition for Common Sense.[227]\nPetraeus delivered the inaugural lecture in a series dedicated to his mentor and the former dean of The Fletcher School at Tufts University, General Jack Galvin.[228] He also delivered the inaugural lecture in a series dedicated to Admiral Stansfield Turner at the U.S. Naval War College on August 7, 2018. The lecture series honors the achievements of Turner, who served as the college's president from 1972 to 1974.[229]\nAs a member of a panel discussion in October 2018 concerning a film documenting the Stars and Stripes newspaper, Petraeus shared his personal experiences with the newspaper with the audience.[230]\nOn June 12, 2019, Petraeus accepted the invitation of a three-year honorary professorship in the Institute of Conflict, Cooperation and Security (ICSS) at the University of Birmingham in England. The university's announcement of the appointment stated that Petraeus \"will share insights from his career with students and researchers through a variety of interactions in Birmingham and virtually.\"[231]\nGeneral Petraeus was the guest speaker at the 500th Night celebration for the U.S. Military Academy's Class of 2020 at West Point, held on January 26, 2019.[232]\n\nSecretary of State consideration[edit]\nOn November 18, 2016, an article by The Guardian cited \"diplomatic sources\" as having said that Petraeus had entered the race for U.S. Secretary of State in the Trump administration.[233] Petraeus confirmed his interest in the position during a BBC Radio 4 interview, stating that he would serve if asked.[234]\nPetraeus met with then President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower on November 28 to discuss the position and world affairs. Both Petraeus and Trump expressed favorable views of the meeting, with Trump taking to Twitter to announce, \"Just met with General Petraeus\u2014was very impressed!\" Petraeus joined a short list of potential candidates for the position, including Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani.[235]\nThere was public speculation that his nomination could hurt Trump's administration, but Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham advocated for Petraeus, calling him \"an extraordinary pick\". Petraeus also received support from Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, suggesting that Democrats would keep an open mind concerning his confirmation.[236]\nOn December 13, 2016, Trump officially selected Rex Tillerson for the role of Secretary of State. Petraeus expressed his gratitude for Trump's consideration and deferred to former secretary of defense Robert Gates' endorsement when asked his opinion of Tillerson.[237]\n\nReaction to the decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan[edit]\nOn April 14, 2021, President Joe Biden announced that all U.S. troops in Afghanistan would be withdrawn from the country by September 11, 2021, against the advice of many of his top generals and many diplomats.[238][239]\nPetraeus has been an outspoken opponent of the U.S.'s strategy for withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the agreements made with the Taliban in preparation thereof. In a Fox News interview on August 17, 2021, Petraeus called former President Donald Trump's decision to release 5,000 detainees of the Taliban held by the Afghanistan government in 2020 flawed and disastrous, with a tragic outcome.[240] In another interview with the Wall Street Journal on August 20, 2021, he noted that the U.S. negotiated with the Taliban expecting to get something in return for withdrawing, which, he said, \"didn't work out\".[241]\nDuring an interview with Fox News on May 12, 2021, Petraeus discussed his opposition to the withdrawal of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, stating, \"I fear that we will come to regret this decision.\"[242] He warned of the possible psychological effects on Afghan forces following removal of U.S. support, the erosion of Afghan Air Force maintenance, and the risk of a \"brutal civil war\".[243][244]\nFollowing a military blitz by the Taliban that ended in the group capturing the country's capital, Kabul, Petraeus again questioned the poor planning of troop withdrawal from the region and reiterated the dangers the world would face from the potential establishment of Al Qaeda or the Islamic State in the Hindu Kush. In an email interview with Die Weltwoche, Petraeus stated \"I do not believe that either terrorist group will pose a near-term threat to the U.S. homeland or our NATO allies. The longer-term threat will depend on our ability to identify, disrupt, and degrade any such sanctuaries.\"[245]\nPetraeus suggested that the removal of 18,000 contractors who maintained aircraft contributed to the surrender of Afghan government forces who ended up lacking air support against the Taliban.[240] In an interview with Brian Kilmeade Petraeus drew parallels between the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Dunkirk evacuation, and the Fall of Saigon. He advised that American forces, drones, and close air support be used to secure Kabul Airport while the U.S. communicates with the Taliban to prevent them from impeding the movement of individuals that are trying to evacuate.[246]\nDuring a discussion with CNN's Peter Bergen, Petraeus predicted that the Taliban would struggle to fund their new government following the withdrawal of U.S. and other donor nation financial support. He suggested that the resultant degradation of basic services and salaries for Afghan workers could ultimately force the Taliban to change their approach with the international community, but that it was too early to tell if the Taliban were reformed.[247]\nDiscussing the topic with NBC's Lester Holt, he expressed his belief that the Taliban's actions on the ground showed that they were \"the same old Taliban\", and that he was fairly confident that Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State would be able to re-establish sanctuaries in the region with the Taliban in power.[248] He expressed doubt that the U.S. would become involved in the country while the Taliban was in power, outside of military and intelligence actions to protect U.S. interests, and suggested that even the establishment of an embassy for diplomatic relations would not happen \"any time soon\".\n\nViews on the Russian invasion of Ukraine[edit]\nPetraeus has been vocally critical of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, joining three other retired military generals to form the Strategic Advisory Council for the Defense of Ukraine in July 2022 to provide strategic expertise and operational assistance to Ukrainian forces.[249]\nEarly in 2022, as tensions mounted between Russia and Ukraine, Petraeus attended a tabletop panel with Admiral Michael Mullen, Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, and Thomas Donilon to discuss economic sanctions, cyber defenses, and anti-Russian insurgency in Ukraine.[250]\nIn public appearances and interviews, Petraeus has criticized not only Russia's motives for the invasion, but also the tactics and standards of the country's military effort. In the weeks following the invasion of Ukraine, Petraeus spoke with Jake Tapper and Anderson Cooper, examining Russia's strategy in attempts to seize Kyiv.[251][252] On March 12, 2022, Petraeus spoke on One Nation with Brian Kilmeade, criticizing the Russian military's failed attempt to achieve a combined arms effect, which, according to Petraeus, wasn't up to the normal standards anticipated by the United States or other NATO countries' militaries.[253] In May 2022, Petraeus commented that, in an attempt to create a stronger Russia, President Putin had instead strengthened the alliance between NATO countries.[254] In a later interview, Petraeus said that the Russian military was nowhere near as good as NATO had thought it would be.[255] He described the Russian military's preferred tactic as that of overwhelming artillery strikes, leading to the question of whether Russia's military valued volume over accuracy.[256] In October 2022, he called Russia's military mobilization in Ukraine \"irreversible and disastrous.\"[257]\nIn addition to criticisms of Russia's war effort, Petraeus also discussed the negative implications that Russian sanctions have for worldwide financial markets, food supplies, and other commodities, and he commended the Ukrainian military for its impressive counter-attacks, specifically a raid on Russian tanks, the killing of five Russian generals, and the destruction of the Russian warship, Saratov.[258][259][260]\nIn mid- to late 2022, Petraeus spoke further on the Western response to Russia's aggression and the impacts U.S. involvement had on Ukraine's defense. In an interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto regarding Russia's plans to annex more regions in Ukraine, he said that US- and UK-supplied high-mobility artillery rocket systems had prompted Russian forces to relocate their headquarters and fuel supplies, which had significantly slowed Russia's advances in Ukraine.[261] In another interview, he said that Western support had improved counteroffensive strategies, resulting in retaking Crimea and Donbas territories from Russia.[262]\nPetraeus has been a strong proponent of continued aid to Ukraine and increased NATO readiness for potential escalations by Russia and its allies.[263][264][265] He spoke of the need for the United States to prioritize military readiness to counter China and to increase aid for Ukraine in the annual defense policy bill.[266] He also discussed the importance of deploying Patriot missile systems in Ukraine as an anti-ballistic missile system and discussed measures that the US and NATO would employ if Russia were to carry out a nuclear attack in Ukraine.[267][268][269] In an Atlantic Council discussion concerning additional aid to Ukraine he emphasized the need for the deployment of Western aircraft and support staff, a stronger defense guarantee, and diplomatic and economic pressures on Russia to hasten peace talks.[270]\nPetraeus expressed the belief that President Putin would eventually realize that the war is not sustainable on the battlefield and would agree to a negotiated resolution with Ukraine.[271][272] In an article published by Foreign Policy magazine, Petraeus joined other experts to derive lessons from the Russian-Ukraine war that would prevent, deter, and combat forthcoming world conflicts.[273]\nDuring a trip to Kyiv, Petraeus joined a group from the Atlantic Council in presenting the council's Global Citizen Award to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, recognizing his exceptional leadership in defending Ukraine against Russian aggression.[274] While in Kyiv, Petraeus visited the American University of Kyiv, discussing his confidence in well-equipped Ukrainian troops and the challenges faced by Russian forces. He emphasized the effectiveness of Ukraine's newly formed brigades equipped with Western tanks and fighting vehicles, offering valuable insights and support to Ukraine's efforts in countering the Russian forces.[275][276]\nIn an interview with CNN, Petraeus shared his view that alleged Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian soil were a way to not only attack valid military targets but also to acquaint the Russian people with the fact that a war was happening. He also described a shift in the Ukrainian strategy in their summer offensive as \"starve, stretch and strike,\" a tactic used to create greater opportunity for success later in the conflict.[277]\nSpeaking with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in response to the slow pace of Ukraine's counteroffensive in the summer of 2023, Petraeus noted that while the Russian military hadn't distinguished itself in many ways, the depth of their defenses in territory seized in Ukraine had proven formidable. In the same interview, he stated his opinion that Ukraine's forces had adapted well to Russian entrenchment, taking their time to pick through mine fields without the aid of air support. Petraeus once again argued for more military aid for Ukraine, and increased sanctions against Russia, in an effort to force a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.[278]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAccording to Petraeus, he does not vote in elections, having stopped following his promotion to major general in 2002 as part of a desire to be seen as apolitical. He has confirmed that he did not vote in the 2016 election.[279][280]\n\nOrganizational memberships[edit]\nCo-chairman, Task Force on North America, Council on Foreign Relations (June 2013 \u2013 December 2015)[281]\nMember, board of directors, Atlantic Council (April 2016 \u2013 present)[282]\nWashington Speakers Bureau (June 2013 \u2013 present)[283]\nMember, board of advisors, Team Rubicon (April 2013 \u2013 present)[284]\nMember, board of directors, Optiv Inc (March 2017 \u2013 present)[285]\nCo-chairman, global advisory council, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (August 2015 \u2013 present)[286]\nMember, advisory council, Veterans Coalition for Common Sense (June 2016 \u2013 present)[287]\nMember, conservation council, Panthera (February 2016 \u2013 present)[288]\nSenior vice president, Royal United Services Institute (June 2013 \u2013 present)[289]\nMember, board of directors, Institute for the Study of War (November 2013 \u2013 present)[290]\nMember, advisory council, American Corporate Partners (April 2013 \u2013 present)[291]\nFaculty advisor, USC Student Veterans Association (September 2013 \u2013 August 2019)[292]\nChairman, KKR Vets at Work (May 2014 \u2013 present)[293][294]\nMember, board of directors, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) (October 2015 \u2013 present)[295]\nMember, Concordia Leadership Council, The Concordia Summit (September 2015 \u2013 present)[296]\nMember, board of trustees, The McCain Institute for International Leadership (December 2015 \u2013 present)[297]\nMember, academic advisory board, Warrior-Scholar Project (February 2016 \u2013 present)[298]\nAdvisor, Global War on Terror Memorial Foundation (February 2016 \u2013 June 2019)[299]\nMember, national security advisory council, U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (April 2016 \u2013 present)[300]\nTrustee, Arthur F.

David H. Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in the war against terrorism in the Middle East and Central Asia, was the spring commencement convocation speaker at Texas A&M University on May 13, a relatively new practice at Texas A & M.[391]\nOn December 9, 2010, Barbara Walters picked Petraeus for the Most Fascinating Person of 2010. Walters called the top commander in Afghanistan \"an American hero\".[392] Petraeus was chosen as \"one of Time magazine's 50 \"People Who Mattered\" in December 2010.[393] The same year he was named number 12 of 50 people who mattered in 2010 by the New Statesmen magazine,[394] and Petraeus was listed as number 8 of 100 Foreign Policy Top 100 Global Thinkers for 2011.[395]\nThe New Statesman annual survey presents the most influential people from pop stars and dissident activists to tech gurus and heads of state, the people doing most to shape our world keep changing. September 26, 2011, Petraeus was listed as number 2 of the 50 for 2011.[396] The Association of Special Operations Professionals named Petraeus as its 2011 Man of the Year for 2011, and was presented the award at Ft. Bragg on November 2, 2011, at its annual Special Operations Exposition.[397]\nIn January 2012, Petraeus was named one of \"The 50 Most Powerful People in Washington\" by GQ magazine.[398] Petraeus was inducted January 29, 2012, into the Reserve Officers Association's (ROA) Minuteman Hall of Fame as the 2011 Inductee during the 2012 ROA National Security Symposium.[399] The German Order of Merit was presented to Petraeus February 14, by the German Secretary of Defense Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re. According to de Maizi\u00e8re, he is an \"outstanding strategist and a true friend of the German people\".[400]\nOn March 16, 2012, the Dutch Minister of Defense Hans Hillen knighted Petraeus at the Hague with the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau with swords. The Minister thanked Petraeus in his speech for his, \"unconditional support to the Dutch troops and for being a driving force behind a successful mission. Through his personal efforts for cooperation between the Netherlands and America, the Netherlands could achieve significant operational successes with the Task Force Uruzgan.\"[401]\nIn 2012, Petraeus received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[402] The following year, in 2013, the New-York Historical Society established the Petraeus-Hertog Lecture Leadership Library series.[403][404] Petraeus was featured alongside 18 other graduates of the United States Military Academy in\u00a0West Point Leadership: Profiles of Courage, a collection of leadership biographies published in 2013.\"[405]\nCaptured correspondence from Osama bin Laden \"Letters from Abbottabad\"[406] revealed that in May 2010, Bin Laden wanted to target President Barack Obama and General Petraeus. Bin Laden wrote: \"The reason for concentrating on them is that Obama is the head of infidelity and killing him automatically will make Biden take over the presidency for the remainder of the term, as it is the norm over there. Biden is totally unprepared for that post, which will lead the U.S. into a crisis.\" It further went on to say, \"As for Petraeus, he is the man of the hour in this last year of the war, and killing him would alter the war's path.\"[407]\nPetraeus and Dr. Henry Kissinger were the inaugural recipients of the Recanati-Kaplan Award for Civic Excellence and Cultural Engagement, presented by the 92nd Street Y on May 19, 2019.[408][409] 92Y later established an Online Master Class in Leadership featuring a library series of lectures by Petraeus.[410][411]\nOn November 19, 2020, General Petraeus became the first American military professional to deliver the annual Lee Knowles Lecture at Cambridge University's Trinity College.[412][413]\nOn December 7, 2020, the Institute for the Study of War launched \"The General David H.

He is the host of the nationally syndicated radio talk show The Dennis Prager Show. In 2009, he co-founded PragerU, which primarily creates five-minute videos from an American conservative perspective, among other content.\nHis initial political work starting in 1969 concerned Refuseniks, the Soviet Jews who were unable to emigrate.[2] He gradually began offering more and broader commentary on politics.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nDennis Prager was born in Brooklyn to Hilda (n\u00e9e\u00a0Friedfeld; 1919\u20132009) and Max Prager (1918\u20132014), the latter the son of Polish Jewish immigrants.[3] Prager and his brother Kenneth Prager,[4] were raised in a Modern Orthodox Jewish home. He attended the Yeshiva of Flatbush in Brooklyn, New York, where he befriended Joseph Telushkin.\nHe went to Brooklyn College and majored in history and Middle Eastern Studies.[citation needed] Over the next few years he took courses at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and at the University of Leeds; he then left academia without finishing a graduate degree. After he left graduate school, Prager left Modern Orthodoxy but maintained many traditional Jewish practices; he remains religious.[1] Prager holds an honorary Doctor of Laws from Pepperdine University.[5]\n\nCareer[edit]\nBeginnings[edit]\nPrager speaking at the California Capitol Building in 2008\nIn 1969, while he was studying in England, he was recruited by a Jewish group to travel to the Soviet Union to interview Jews about their life there. When he returned the next year, he was in demand as a speaker on repression of Soviet Jews; he earned enough from lectures to travel, and visited around sixty countries.[2][6] He became the national spokesman for the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry.[7]\nThe start of Prager's career overlapped with a growing tendency among American Jews, who had been staunchly liberal, to move toward the center and some to the right, driven in part by the influx of Jews from the Soviet Union.[8] In 1975, Prager and Telushkin published an introduction to Judaism intended for nonobservant Jews: The Nine Questions People Ask About Judaism, which became a bestseller. Among the questions addressed in the text were: how does Judaism differ from Christianity, and can one doubt the existence of God and still be a good Jew, and how do you account for unethical but religious Jews?[1][9]\nPrager ran the Brandeis-Bardin Institute from 1976 to 1983; Telushkin worked with him there.[1] It was Prager's first salaried job.[6]  He soon earned a reputation as a moral critic attacking secularism and narcissism, both of which he said were destroying society; some people called him a Jewish Billy Graham.[6]\n\n1980s[edit]\nIn 1982, KABC (AM) in Los Angeles hired Prager to host its Sunday night religious talk show Religion on the Line,[2] which got top ratings[10] and eventually led to a weekday talk show.[11][12] He and Telushkin published another book in 1983, Why the Jews?  The Reason for Antisemitism.[1]\nAccording to a review in Commentary, the book depicts antisemitism as a \"sinister form of flattery\"; the authors wrote that hatred of Jews arises from resentment over Jews' acceptance of the doctrine that they are God's chosen people, charged with bringing a moral message to the world.[13] The book describes Jews as both a nation (stateless for a long time) and followers of a religion and says that this identity is essential to Judaism; the book says that calls for Jews to culturally assimilate as well as opposition to Zionism are both forms of antisemitism.[13][14] The book describes secular Jews as people who have lost their way, and who generally fall into the error of applying Judaism's mission to reform the world in ways that tend to be leftist, totalitarian, and destructive.[13][14]\nHe also wrote a syndicated column for newspapers across the country. In 1985, Prager launched his own quarterly journal, Ultimate Issues,[2] which was renamed to The Prager Perspective[12] in 1996.[1]\nIn 1986, he divorced and underwent a year of therapy, which the Encyclopedia of Judaism says contributed to his 1999 book Happiness is a Serious Problem.[1] In 1990, he wrote an essay called \"Judaism, Homosexuality and Civilization\" that argued against normalizing homosexuality in the Jewish community[15] and placed sexual sins on a continuum from premarital sex, celibacy, adultery, homosexuality, bestiality, and incest; he argued that confining sex to heterosexual marriage desexualized religion, which was a great achievement of ancient Jewish tradition that was worth fighting to retain.[16]\n\n1990s[edit]\nBy 1992, he was remarried.[15] By that time he was, according to the Los Angeles Jewish Journal, a \"fixture on local radio\" and \"a Jewish St. George battling the forces of secularity on behalf of simple 'goodness'\", and generally socially conservative, with some exceptions; he supported a woman's legal access to abortion (although he said it was usually immoral), and supported and justified sex between non-married consenting men and women.[15] In 1992, he became involved with the Stephen S. Wise Temple and gave talks there,[1] and got a weekday night talk show on KABC.[17]\nIn 1994, Prager also did an hour each weekday, via satellite on WABC, KABC's sister station in New York, before doing his KABC show locally.[18]\nDuring the 1994\u20131995 television season, Multimedia Entertainment syndicated a television show featuring Prager.[19][20] Prager said he was \"ambivalent about television as a medium for deep, intelligent programming\" but that the show was \"an incredible opportunity to reach a mass audience with my belief system\".[21] In 1995, he moved the studio audience on-stage with him where they could interact with him more directly.[22]\n\nPolitical commentary[edit]\nPrager speaking at a Turning Point USA event in 2020Prager supported Jimmy Carter in the 1976 US presidential election.[23] In 1994, the Anti-Defamation League published a report on antisemitism in the Christian right movement; Prager, who aligned with the social and political conservatism of the Christian right, attacked the ADL and its report.[24] In 1995, he urged conservative Jews to be open to working with conservative Christians, like the Christian Coalition.[25] In 1995, he named Jacob Petuchowski, Eliezer Berkovits, Harold Kushner, C.S. Lewis, Richard John Neuhaus, Michael Novak, and George Gilder as the people who had influenced his theology the most.[26]\nIn 1995, Prager criticized the Illinois Supreme Court decision in the Baby Richard case that removed a child from his adoptive parents.[27] With KABC he held a \"Rally for Baby Richard\",[28] where he got support from actors Priscilla Presley, Tom Selleck, and John McCook.[11]\nIn 1996, Prager testified in Congress in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act. Prager testified that \"the acceptance of homosexuality as the equal of heterosexual marital love signifies the decline of Western civilization.\"[29][30] Prager worked with Bob Dole's campaign in the 1996 presidential election; when polls prior to the election showed that the Dole campaign did not have much Jewish support, Prager said this was because \"American Jews are ignorant regarding the anti Israel aspects of the current Democrat Party.\"[31]\nSince 1999, he has hosted a nationally syndicated talk show on the socially and politically conservative Christian radio station KRLA in Los Angeles.[1] KRLA is part of the Salem Media Group that carries other conservative hosts, including James Dobson, Randall Terry, Janet Parshall, Sebastian Gorka and Larry Elder; it is a key voice of the Christian right that seeks to change American politics as well as the way that individual people live.[32][33]\nIn 2006, Prager criticized Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, for announcing that he would use the Quran for the reenactment of his swearing in ceremony.[34] Prager wrote: \"Insofar as a member of Congress taking an oath to serve America and uphold its values is concerned, America is interested in only one book, the Bible. If you are incapable of taking an oath on that book, don't serve in Congress.\" In response, former New York City Mayor Ed Koch called for Prager to end his service on the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Council.[35]\nIn 2009, Prager joined other Salem Radio Network hosts to oppose the Affordable Care Act.[36] In 2014, while same-sex marriage in the United States was in the process of being nationally legalized, he wrote that if that were to happen, then \"there is no plausible argument for denying polygamous relationships, or brothers and sisters, or parents and adult children, the right to marry.\"[37][38] In 2014, he also said that the \"heterosexual AIDS\" crisis was something \"entirely manufactured by the Left\".[38]\nPrager endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, but said that Trump was his \"17th choice out of 17 candidates\". He clarified that he \"was not a Trump supporter, when there was a choice\" but added, \"There is no choice now.\"[39] Prager had previously said that Trump was \"unfit to be a presidential candidate, let alone president\".[40] Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic criticized Prager for endorsing Trump.[41]\nIn 2017, Prager was invited to be a guest conductor for the volunteer orchestra of Santa Monica, California, as part of a fundraising concert at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Some of the orchestra members protested the invitation, which they considered promoting bigotry. The orchestra leader, Guido Lamell, had invited Prager because he admired him, as Prager often discussed and promoted classical music on his shows and had guest-conducted a few times in the past, and because he thought Prager's presence might help raise more money.[38][37] Lamell called Prager \"a great man, leader and friend\".[42]\nIn February 2020, he told a caller: \"Of course you should never call anybody the n-word, that's despicable,\" but complained about the word itself being considered unacceptable.[43][44] In April 2020, Prager called the COVID-19 lockdowns \"the greatest mistake in the history of humanity.\"[45][46] He was subsequently criticized in the media for trivializing the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic.[47] In a 2020 video called \"'Follow the Science' Is a LIE\", Prager touted Sweden's response to COVID-19 and asserted, \"Sweden is the proof that lockdowns are useless\". A fact check in December 2020 found Prager's claim false, as Sweden had higher rates of COVID infection and mortality than other Scandinavian countries.[48]\nIn a November 2021 Newsmax interview, Prager argued that \"irrational fears\" about people not vaccinated against COVID-19 had wrongly made them \"the pariahs of America as I have not seen in my lifetime\", more than gay men and intravenous drug users during the AIDS crisis, who he inaccurately said had not been ostracized.[49][50] The Independent called his comments \"alarming revisionism\".[49] In the interview, Prager also called concerns about climate change \"idiotic\" and \"irrational\".[49]\n\nPragerU[edit]\nMain article: PragerU\nIn 2009, Prager and his producer Allen Estrin started a website called PragerU, which creates five-minute videos on various topics from a conservative perspective.[51][52][needs update] BuzzFeed News described PragerU as \"one of the biggest, most influential and yet least understood forces in online media.\" As of 2018[update] it spent around 40% of its annual $10 million budget on marketing; each video is produced according to a consistent style. Videos cover topics such as \"racism, sexism, income inequality, gun ownership, Islam, immigration, Israel, police brutality\" and speech on college campuses. BuzzFeed News wrote that \"the biggest reason PragerU has escaped national attention is that it mostly doesn't do Trump,\" or engage with the political news cycle.[40]  Some of its videos had viewer access restricted by YouTube in 2017.[53]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nPrager speaks English, French, Russian and Hebrew.[54] His brother, Kenneth Prager, is a physician and professor at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.[4] His nephew, Joshua Prager, is a former writer for The Wall Street Journal.[55]\nAccording to Media Matters for America, on October 18, 2021, Prager announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19 the previous week and had received ivermectin and Regeneron's monoclonal antibody treatment.[56] He said he had been taking hydroxychloroquine with zinc prophylactically \"from the beginning\", and that \"natural immunity\" from deliberately contracting COVID-19 was what he had \"hoped for the entire time\".[57]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nIn 2018, Prager published a commentary on the Book of Exodus; this was followed by another commentary on the Book of Genesis in 2019. Both were published by the Salem Media Group.[9]\n\nThe Nine Questions People Ask About Judaism (with Joseph Telushkin) (1986) ISBN\u00a0978-0-671-62261-9\nThink a Second Time (44 Essays on 44 Subjects) (1996) ISBN\u00a0978-0-06-098709-1\nHappiness Is a Serious Problem: A Human Nature Repair Manual[12] (1999) ISBN\u00a0978-0-06-098735-0\nWhy the Jews?

DW's satellite television service consists of channels in English, German, Spanish, Persian, and Arabic.[4] The work of DW is regulated by the Deutsche Welle Act,[note 1][5] stating that content is intended to be independent of government influence. DW is a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).[6]\nDW offers regularly updated articles on its news website and runs its own center for international media development, DW Akademie. The broadcaster's stated goals are to produce reliable news coverage, provide access to the German language, and promote understanding between peoples.[7] It is also a provider of live streaming world news which can be viewed via its website, YouTube, and various mobile devices and digital media players.\nDW has been broadcasting since 1953. It is headquartered in Bonn, where its radio programmes are produced. However, television broadcasts are produced almost entirely in Berlin. Both locations create content for DW's news website. As of 2020, Deutsche Welle had 1,668 employees (annual average).[8] In total, over 4,000 distinct people of over 140 nationalities work in DW's offices in Bonn and Berlin, as well as at other locations worldwide.[9]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nPrecursor[edit]\nA predecessor with a similar name was Deutsche Welle GmbH, which was founded in August 1924 by German diplomat and radio pioneer Ernst Ludwig Voss in Berlin and broadcast regularly from January 7, 1926. The station was initially owned by 70% by Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft and 30% by the Free State of Prussia. From 1931 onwards, Deutsche Welle broadcast from the Berlin Broadcasting House. On January 1, 1933, Deutsche Welle GmbH was officially transferred to Deutschlandsender GmbH. \nThe station sees itself in the tradition of the first German foreign broadcaster, the Weltrundfunksender (world broadcaster) of the Weimar Republic. The Weltrundfunksender was renamed to deutscher Kurzwellensender (German Shortwave Broadcaster) by the Nazis in 1933.\n\nBeginnings[edit]\nDW's first shortwave broadcast took place on 3 May 1953 with an address by the then-West German President, Theodor Heuss. On 11 June 1953, ARD public broadcasters signed an agreement to share responsibility for Deutsche Welle. At first, it was controlled by Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR). In 1955, NWDR split into Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) and Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR), WDR assumed responsibility for Deutsche Welle programming. In 1960, Deutsche Welle became an independent public body after a court ruled that while broadcasting to Germany was a state matter, broadcasting from Germany was part of the federal government's foreign affairs function.[10] On 7 June 1962, DW joined ARD as a national broadcasting station.[11] Deutsche Welle was originally headquartered in the West German city of Cologne. After reunification, when much of the government relocated to Berlin, the station's headquarters moved to Bonn.\n\nGerman reunification[edit]\nWith the German reunification in 1990, Radio Berlin International (RBI), East Germany's international broadcaster ceased to exist. Some of the RBI staff joined Deutsche Welle and DW inherited some broadcasting facilities, including transmitting facilities at Nauen, as well as RBI's frequencies.\nDW (TV) began as RIAS-TV, a television station launched by the West Berlin broadcaster RIAS (Radio in the American Sector / Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor) in August 1988; they also acquired the German Educational Television Network in the United States. The rein of the Berlin Wall the following year and German reunification in 1990 meant that RIAS-TV was to be closed down. On 1 April 1992, Deutsche Welle inherited the RIAS-TV broadcast facilities, using them to start a German- and English-language television channel broadcast via satellite, DW (TV), adding a short Spanish broadcast segment the following year. In 1995, it began 24-hour operation (12 hours German, 10 hours English, 2 hours Spanish). At that time, DW (TV) introduced a new news studio and a new logo.\nDeutsche Welle took some of the former independent radio broadcasting service Deutschlandfunk's foreign-language programming in 1993, when Deutschlandfunk was absorbed into the new Deutschlandradio.\nIn addition to radio and television programming, DW sponsored some published material. For example, the South-Asia Department published German Heritage: A Series Written for the South Asia Programme in 1967 and 1984 published African Writers on the Air. Both publications were transcripts of DW programming.\n\nInternet presence[edit]\nIn September 1994, Deutsche Welle was the first public broadcaster in Germany with an internet presence, initially www-dw.gmd.de, hosted by the GMD Information Technology Research Center. For its first two years, the site listed little more than contact addresses, although DW's News Journal was broadcast in RealAudio from Real's server beginning in 1995, and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung's initial web presence, which included news articles from the newspaper, shared the site. In 1996, it evolved into a news website using the URL dwelle.de; in 2001, the URL changed to www.dw-world.de, and was changed again in 2012, to www.dw.de. Deutsche Welle purchased the domain dw.com, which previously belonged to DiamondWare, in 2013; DW had attempted to claim ownership of the address in 2000, without success. DW eventually moved to the www.dw.com domain on 22 June 2015. According to DW, their website delivers information by topic with an intuitive navigation organized to meet users' expectations. The layout offers more flexibility to feature pictures, videos, and in-depth reporting on the day's events in a multimedia and multilingual fashion. They also integrated their Media Center into the dw.de website making it easier for users to access videos, audio, and picture galleries from DW's multimedia archive of reports, programs, and coverage of special issues.[12]\nDW's news site is in seven core languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese for Brazil, and Russian), as well as a mixture of news and information in 23 other languages in which Deutsche Welle broadcasts. Persian became the site's eighth focus language in 2007.\nGerman and European news is DW's central focus, but the site also offers background information about Germany and German language courses.[13] Deutsch, Warum Nicht? (literally: German, Why Not?) is a personal course for learning the German language, created by Deutsche Welle and the Goethe-Institut.[14]\nIn 2003, the German government passed a new \"Deutsche Welle Act\", which defined DW as a tri-media organization, making the Deutsche Welle website an equal partner with DW-TV and DW Radio. The website is available in 30 languages, but focuses on German, English, Spanish, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, and Arabic. Persian became the eighth focus language in 2007.\nIn March 2009, DW-TV expanded its television services in Asia with two new channels, namely DW-TV Asia and DW-TV Asia+. DW-TV Asia (DW-TV Asien in German) contains 16 hours of German programming and 8 hours in English, whilst DW-TV Asia+ contains 18 hours of English programmes plus 6 hours of German programmes.[15]\nIn August 2009, DW-TV's carriage in the United Kingdom on Sky channel 794 ceased, although the channel continues to be available via other European satellites receivable in the UK.[16]\nIn 2011, DW announced a significant reduction of service including the closure of most of its FM services in the Balkans (except for Romani), but that it would expand its network of FM partners in Africa. The radio production for Hausa, Kiswahili, French, and Portuguese for Africa was optimized for FM broadcasts and DW also produces a regional radio magazine daily in English, to be rebroadcast by partners in Africa.\nAudio content in Arabic is distributed online, via mobile, or rebroadcast by partners.\nDW announced it would focus on FM partnerships for Bengali, Urdu, Dari/Pashtu, and Indonesian for South Asia, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.\nOn 1 November 2011, DW discontinued shortwave broadcasts in German, Russian, Persian, and Indonesian and ended its English service outside Africa. Chinese programming was reduced from 120 minutes to 60 minutes a week. As of November 2011, DW only broadcast radio programming via shortwave in: Amharic, Chinese, Dari, English and French for Africa, Hausa, Kiswahili, Pashtu, Portuguese for Africa and Urdu.[17]\nThe budget of the Deutsche Welle for 2016 was 301.8\u00a0million euros.[18]\nOn 25 February 2018, DW-TV published \"The Climate Cover Up \u2013 Big Oil's Campaign of Deception\" (2018)[19] after documents confirmed big oil companies have known[20] the burning of fossil fuels impacts climate since 1957.[21]\n\nFunding[edit]\nDeutsche Welle is funded from federal grants taken from the federal tax revenue.[22]\nSince the reorganisation of broadcasting as a result of German reunification, Deutsche Welle has been the only remaining broadcasting corporation under federal law. In contrast to the national public broadcasters, which are financed by the license fee the ARD state broadcasters, Deutschlandradio and ZDF, it is not financed through the broadcasting fee, but from federal taxes. The Ministry for Culture and Media is responsible for the financing, which in turn allows the DW to offer a broadcast with low to nonexistent advertising time.\n\nRebranding television news[edit]\nOn 22 June 2015, DW TV launched a 24-hour English-language news channel with a new design and a new studio as part of a rebrand to DW News. Previously, DW's news programmes were called Journal and broadcast in English in 3-, 15- and 30-minute blocks. The new channel offers 30-minute updates every hour and 60-minute programmes twice a day on weekdays. DW News broadcasts from Berlin but frequently has live social media segments hosted from a specially designed studio in Bonn. The German, Spanish, and Arabic channels also received a new design.\nAt the same time, DW's news website moved from a .de URL to .com and added a social media stream to its front page. The refreshed DW services were launched under the tagline 'Made for Minds'.\n\nPlans for the future[edit]\nDeutsche Welle has developed a two-tier approach that they are using for the future growth of their company which consists of a global approach and a regional approach. Within their global approach, DW has now made plans to boost its competitiveness market throughout the world with news and television coverage. The plan implements covering almost all regions of the world with two television channels in each region. With some exclusions, the entire world will be covered. Hours covered range throughout regions and the coverage will be in German, English, Spanish, and Arabic.[23]\nThe regional approach looks at marketing over the Internet to offer news coverage in languages other than the 4 being offered. With updates on DW's website news will be better tailored to each region. Over time, they plan to diversify their online coverage with more regional content being covered.[23]\n\nCensorship[edit]\nOn 10 April 2019, DW announced that Venezuela's state telecoms regulator Conatel had halted its Spanish-language channel. By 15 April, the broadcasting service was restored.[24]\nIn 2019, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused DW of calling on Russians to take part in recent anti-government protests and threatened it would take action against the outlet under domestic law if it made such calls again.[25] Shortly after, Russia's parliament accused DW of breaking election legislation and asked the foreign ministry to consider revoking the German broadcaster's right to work in the country.[26] By November, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declared he did not support banning foreign media outlets.[26]\nOn 3 February 2022, in retaliation to Germany's broadcasting regulator's decision to ban the transmission of the Russian state-run RT Deutsch channel over a lack of a broadcasting license, the Russian foreign ministry said that it would shut down DW's Moscow bureau, strip all DW staff of their accreditation and terminate broadcasting of DW in Russia. It also stated that it would begin the procedure of designating DW as a \"foreign agent\".[27]\nThe Moscow office of Deutsche Welle was informed that it would be shut at 9:00 on Friday, 4 February 2022.[28] DW made plans to relocate Moscow operations to the Latvian capital, Riga.[29]\nOn 30 June 2022, DW was banned in Turkey upon the request of Radio and Television Supreme Council (RT\u00dcK). RT\u00dcK ordered DW in February 2022 to pay the license fee or to terminate their service in Turkey.[30]\nIn October 2022, Iran sanctioned DW Farsi for coverage of 2022 Iranian protests. Iran's Foreign Ministry announced the sanctions in a statement, accusing those listed of \"supporting terrorism.\"[31][32]\n\nLogos[edit]\n\n\n\nFirst logo (1953)\n\n\n\nSecond logo (1992\u20131995), introduced following the start of Deutsche Welle TV in 1992\n\n\n\nThird logo (1995\u20132012)\n\n\n\nFourth and current logo (2012\u2013present)\n\n\n\n\nBroadcast languages[edit]\n\n\nLanguage\nBegan\nCeased\nRemarks\n\n\nGerman\n1953[33]\n\nTV (before 31 December 2023)  [34][35][36]\n\n\nEnglish *\n1954[33]\n\nRadio & TV\n\n\nFrench *\n\nRadio\n\n\nSpanish\n\nTV\n\n\nPortuguese\n\nRadio\n\n\nArabic\n1959[37]\n\nRadio & TV\n\n\nPersian\n1962[38]\n\n\n\n\nTurkish\n\n\n\n\nRussian\n\nRadio\n\n\nPolish *\n\n\n\n\nCzech *\n2000[39]\n\n\n\nSlovak *\n2000[39]\n\n\n\nHungarian *\n2000-2021[39]\n\n\n\nSerbo-Croatian *\n1992[40]\n\n\n\nSwahili\n1963[38]\n\nRadio\n\n\nHausa\n\nRadio\n\n\nIndonesian (Malay)\n\n\n\n\nBulgarian\n\n\n\n\nRomanian *\n\n\n\n\nSlovene\n2000\n\n\n\nModern Greek\n1964[38]\n\nRadio\n\n\nHindi\n\n\n\n\nBengali\n\n\n\n\nUrdu\n\n\n\n\nItalian *\n1998[41]\n\n\n\nChinese\n1965[42]\n\n\n\n\nAmharic\n\nRadio\n\n\nSanskrit\n1966\n1998\n\n\n\nJapanese\n1969[42]\n2000[39]\n\n\n\nMacedonian\n\n\n\n\nPashto\n1970[43]\n\n\n\n\nDari\n\n\n\n\nSerbian\n1992[40]\n\n\n\n\nCroatian\n\n\n\n\nAlbanian\n\n\n\n\nBosnian\n1997[41]\n\n\n\n\nDanish *\n1965\n1998[41]\n\n\n\nNorwegian *\n\n\n\nSwedish *\n\n\n\nDutch *\n1967\n\n\n\nUkrainian\n2000[39]\n\n\n\n\nBelarusian\n2005[44]\n2011\u20132020\n\n\n\nTamil\n2021\n\n\n\n\u00a0* partly by Deutschlandfunk (until 1993)\n\nShortwave relay stations[edit]\nShortwave relay stations outside Germany[edit]\nTrincomalee, Sri Lanka (1984 to 2013) sold to Sri Lanka Broadcasting Cooperation\n3 \u00d7 250\u00a0kW shortwave transmitters\n1 \u00d7 400\u00a0kW mediumwave transmitter\n20 antennas (to be verified)\nKigali, Rwanda: A relay station in Kigali, Rwanda, was inaugurated on 30 August 1963, and provided coverage for Africa.[45] This relay station closed 28 March 2015.\n4 \u00d7 250\u00a0kW shortwave transmitters\nSines, Portugal closed on 30 October 2011 and was due to be dismantled after a few months.\n3 \u00d7 250\u00a0kW shortwave transmitters\nRadio Antilles, Montserrat[46][47]\nDW used a relay station in Malta that had three SW and one 600\u00a0kW-MW transmitter and gave partial coverage of the Americas, Southern Asia and the Far East.[48] It was inaugurated on 29 July 1974 in exchange for a grant of almost 1\u00a0million GBP. The station closed in January 1996.\nFormerly, DW shared a transmitting station on Antigua in the Caribbean with the BBC.[49] It was inaugurated on 1 November 1976 and closed on 31 March 2005. It had a relay-exchange with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that allowed DW to use two 250\u00a0kW transmitters in Sackville, New Brunswick until that facility closed down in 2012.[50]\nIn July 2011 Deutsche Welle began implementing a major reform. The main changes have been a radical reduction of shortwave radio broadcasting\u2014from a daily total of 260 to 55 hours\u2014and an expansion of television broadcasting.[23]\n\nRelay stations leasing transmitter time to DW[edit]\nThis section relies largely or entirely upon a single source.

It offers training and consulting services to partners around the world. It works with broadcasters, media organizations, and universities especially in developing and transitioning countries to promote free and independent media. The work is funded mainly by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development.[57]\nAdditional sponsors are the German Foreign Office and the European Union.\nDW Akademie's journalism traineeship is an 18-month program for young journalists that provides editorial training in the three areas in which Deutsche Welle produces content: radio, television and online. It is aimed at aspiring journalists from Germany as well as from regions to which Deutsche Welle broadcasts.[58]\nThe \"International Media Studies\" Master's Program, offered in cooperation with the University of Bonn and the University Bonn-Rhein-Sieg of Applied Sciences, is based at DW Akademie. The four-semester program combines the disciplines of media development, media regulation, and communications. The seminars are held in English and German and the degree is aimed at media representatives from developing and transitioning countries.\nCarsten von Nahmen became head of DW Akademie in September 2018. He had been DW's senior correspondent in Washington since February 2017 and prior to this, deputy editor-in-chief and head of DW's main news department since 2014. Christian Gramsch was director of DW Akademie from November 2013 until May 2018, and prior to this DW's regional director for multimedia. He succeeded DW Akademie director Gerda Meuer, who had previously been deputy editor-in-chief of Deutsche Welle's radio program, and had earlier worked for various media outlets and as a correspondent for Inter News service. Ute Schaeffer has been DW Akademie's deputy head since 2014 and was previously Deutsche Welle's editor-in-chief.[59]\n\nLearn German section[edit]\nThis section relies excessively on references to primary sources.

They offer free video and audio courses with access to exercises and transcripts. Users can also search for suitable courses and test which level they are at.[60] Among the material available in their site, they offer free access to an animated series called \"Harry Lost in Time\" (Harry gefangen in der Zeit), for beginners.[61] Through Flash animation, the series tells the story of a fictional character named Harry Walkott, a man who is struck by lightning in the Black Forest during his vacation in Germany and, because of this, becomes stuck in time, with the same day repeating over and over. With an English narration, the series introduces German expressions, words and grammar explanations, and also provides exercises to the user.\n\nAntisemitism controversies[edit]\nReporting from The Guardian in January 2020 raised allegations of \"sexual harassment, racism, antisemitism, and severe bullying\" within the organization.[62]\nOn 5 December 2021, Deutsche Welle announced that it would suspend its partnership with a Jordanian partner, Roya TV, on account of antisemitic content published on Roya's social media.[63] Guido Baumhauer, a senior executive with DW, apologized, saying: \"We are truly sorry that we did not notice these disgusting images.\"[63] Roya TV rejected the accusation and said it was the target of \"hostile campaign\" by unnamed parties.[64]\nIn November 2021, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung published an investigation into social media comments allegedly made by members of DW's Arabic service, including posts that appeared to downplay the Holocaust or perpetuate anti-Jewish stereotypes.[65][66] On 3 December 2021, DW announced that it was suspending four employees and one freelancer during an external investigation, to be led by former German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger and psychologist Ahmad Mansour, into the allegations.[63][65] On 7 February, this investigation concluded that DW was correct to suspend these five employees, and recommended further action against eight other employees; it also recommended ending cooperation agreements with some Middle East-based news outlets, but concluded that there was no \"structural antisemitism\" at DW.[66] Following the report, DW terminated the contracts of several other employees, including the former bureau chief in Beirut, who advocated the execution of \"[a]nyone who has to do with the Israelis\"; an employee who claimed that Israel controls people's brains \"through art, media and music\"; and a third journalist had posted \"the Holocaust is a lie.\"[67][68] Several of those fired stated that they had not been given a chance to defend their case, criticized DW's lack of clarity regarding guidelines for what constituted antisemitism, and said they felt they were being censored in what they could write about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.[69][67]\nIn September 2022, Farah Maraqa, one of seven Arab employees of DW fired[69] in February, subsequently sued DW and won her case. The court ruled that her dismissal on charges of anti-Semitism was \"legally unjustified\". A former colleague, Maram Salem, won her case in July against DW for unlawful termination, ruling that her Facebook posts were not anti-Semitic.[70]\nAlso in September 2022, Deutsche Welle updated its Code of Conduct to include \"Germany's historical responsibility for the Holocaust is also a reason for which we support the right of Israel to exist\" among their values and noted antisemitism is grounds for dismissal.[71] The updated code of conduct is thought to improve Deutsche Welle's chances of successfully terminating antisemitic employees in the future.[72]\nIn August 2023, The New Arab published the results of a year long investigation by Palestinian news website Arab48 which concluded that Arab employees were unfairly dismissed over largely spurious antisemitism charges.[73][74]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nGermany portalJournalism portalTelevision portal\nEuronews\nKarin Helmstaedt \u2013 DW presenter for the Euromaxx culture and lifestyle show\nMax Hofmann \u2013 Brussels Bureau Chief for DW in Belgium\nTelevision in Germany\nList of world news channels\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Gesetz \u00fcber die Rundfunkanstalt des Bundesrechts \"Deutsche Welle\"\n\n\nReferences[edit]\nCitations[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Johnson, Ian (21 August 2014). \"German Broadcaster Fires Chinese Blogger\".

Morris encouraged Clinton to pursue Third Way policies of triangulation that combined traditional Republican and Democratic proposals, rhetoric, and issues so as to achieve maximum political gain and popularity. He worked as a Republican strategist before joining the Clinton administration, where he helped Clinton recover from the Republican Revolution by advising him to adopt more moderate policies.[8] The president consulted Morris in secret beginning in 1994.[9] Clinton's communications director George Stephanopoulos has said, \"Over the course of the first nine months of 1995, no single person had more power over the president.\"[10] Morris went on to become campaign manager of  Clinton's successful 1996 bid for re-election as president, but his tenure on that political campaign was cut short two months before the election, when it was revealed that he had not only solicited a prostitute but also allowed her to listen in on conversations with the President.\nAs of 2000, Morris wrote a weekly column for the New York Post that is carried nationwide, and contributes columns and blogs to both the print and online versions of The Hill. He is also president of Vote.com.[11] By 2005, Morris had emerged as a harsh critic of the Clintons and wrote several books that criticize them, including Rewriting History, a rebuttal to then-U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton's Living History.[12]\nMorris was the strategist for Republican Christy Mihos's campaign in the 2010 Massachusetts gubernatorial election,[13] and supported Mitt Romney in 2012, predicting that he would achieve a landslide victory. Blogger Andrew Sullivan has named an annual award after Morris, given for \"stunningly wrong political, social and cultural predictions\".[14] He has appeared in the past on Fox News for political commentary, especially appearing on The O'Reilly Factor and Hannity.[15][16] After the 2012 presidential election, Morris did not appear on Fox News for three months, and the network ultimately opted not to renew his contract.[17]\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nMorris was born in 1948 in New York City, New York, the son of writer Terry Lesser Morris, an early proponent of confessional human interest stories, and attorney Eugene J. Morris.[18] He attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City,[19] where he was active on the debate team. He managed Jerrold Nadler's campaign for class president. Morris was also involved in the first campaign of Richard Gottfried for New York State Assembly in 1970. Morris graduated from Stuyvesant in 1964, then attended Columbia University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree, graduating in 1967.[20] At Columbia, he roomed with Nadler.[21]\n\nMorris and the Clintons[edit]\nMorris first worked with Bill and Hillary Clinton during Bill Clinton's successful 1978 bid for Governor of Arkansas. Morris did not have a role in Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign, which instead was headed by David Wilhelm, James Carville, George Stephanopoulos, and Paul Begala. After the 1994 midterm elections, in which Republicans took control of both houses of the United States Congress and gained considerable power in the states, Clinton once again sought Morris' help to prepare for the 1996 presidential election.\nIn his writings, Morris \"recounts the First Lady\u2019s numerous kindnesses to his aging (and of course Jewish[22]) parents.\"[23]\n\nProstitute scandal[edit]\nOn August 29, 1996, Morris resigned from the Clinton campaign after tabloid reports stated that he had been involved with a prostitute, Sherry Rowlands, as reported by The Washington Post. A New York tabloid newspaper, Star, had obtained and published a set of photographs allegedly of Morris and the woman on a Washington, D.C., hotel balcony. News of the impending publication broke during the third day of the 1996 Democratic Convention. The Electronic Telegraph reported unverified claims that in order to impress Rowlands, Morris invited her to listen in on his conversations with President Clinton. It was reported that Rowlands worked for $200 an hour and that after he solicited her for sex, Morris gave Rowlands access to President Clinton's campaign speeches before they were delivered and also let her hear the President's voice during a telephone conservation.[24] According to Rowlands, Morris had a fondness for sucking toes.[25][26][27] It was also alleged he had an out-of-wedlock child from an affair with a Texas woman.[28]\nMorris resigned on the same day that Bill Clinton spoke and accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention. In his resignation statement, he said that \"while I served I sought to avoid the limelight because I did not want to become the message. Now, I resign so I will not become the issue.\"[29] In his response, President Clinton praised Morris as a \"friend\", and publicly thanked him for his years of service. Privately, several of Clinton's aides were furious that in his resignation statement Morris credited himself with helping the President \"come back from being buried in a landslide\" and that Morris ended by comparing himself to Robert F. Kennedy.[30]\nMorris was featured on two consecutive covers of Time magazine. The September 2, 1996 issue, which was released before the prostitute story broke, featured Morris as \"The Man Who Has Clinton's Ear\".[8] The following week, the cover featured Morris and his wife, Eileen McGann, and the headline read \"The Morris Mess: After the Fall\".[30]\nMontgomery Blair Sibley wrote a book Why Just Her in defence of the \"Washington Madam\", Debra Jeane Palfrey. In it, he wrote that Morris was a client of Palfrey's escort agency, and the first individual he (Sibley) planned to call in Palfrey's defence.[31]\n\nLater work[edit]\nIn his 1997 book, Behind the Oval Office, Morris wrote that, following an argument in the Arkansas Governor's Mansion in May 1990, he strode toward the exit and was tackled by Clinton. In 2003, Morris further stated that Clinton cocked his arm back to throw a punch, but Hillary Clinton pulled her husband off Morris. In both versions of the story, she consoled Morris and apologized to him, stating that Bill behaved as such only with those he cared for most. According to Morris, she did this to keep him quiet about the incident. He says the incident was the reason for denying Bill Clinton's request to work on the 1992 campaign.[32]\nMorris has become a vocal and regular critic of the Clintons since his departure, in particular Hillary Rodham Clinton and her bid for the presidency. Morris has written extensively about the Clintons (see below) and also contributed to Hillary: The Movie, a documentary about Rodham Clinton when she was still a 2008 presidential candidate.[33] Later, after Bill Clinton's comments about the similarities between Barack Obama's popularity and that of presidential candidate Jesse Jackson in 1988, Morris put out an article on his blog that asserted that this was Clinton's way of injecting race into the political campaign.[34]\n\nPolitical consulting[edit]\nAs of August 2009, Morris lends his name and assistance to the League of American Voters, an advocacy group for seniors to defeat the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He has been described as \"America's most ruthless political consultant\" in the BBC documentary Century of the Self,[35] which chronicled how he brought lifestyle marketing to politics for the first time.\nMorris has consulted for candidates in other countries of the western hemisphere, including the campaigns of Fernando de la Rua for President of Argentina (1999), Jorge Batlle for President of Uruguay (1999), Vicente Fox for President of Mexico (2000), and Raphael Trotman for President of Guyana (2006).[36]\nMorris and his wife, Eileen McGann, are behind www.vote.com, a site intended to register non-scientific political public opinion on various issues.\nMorris worked as a strategist for Christy Mihos, who sought the Republican nomination to run for Governor of Massachusetts in 2010 against incumbent Deval Patrick overseeing strategy, polling, and advertising.[13] At the Republican state convention, Mihos lost to Charlie Baker by 89 percent to 11 percent; by failing to reach 15 percent, Mihos did not qualify for a primary against Baker.[37]\n\nGuest commentator and political prognosticator[edit]\nSince leaving Clinton's employ in 1996, Morris has said he has become profoundly \"disillusioned\" with the actions of the Clintons in the late 1990s. He has since formed a career as a political commentator and critic of the Clintons (particularly Hillary), appearing on Fox News programs such as Hannity & Colmes, Hannity, and The O'Reilly Factor, and on various local and nationally syndicated radio talk shows. Morris is also a regular columnist and Pundits Blogger for The Hill, a nonpartisan daily newspaper based in Washington, D.C., and for Newsmax, a conservative online news website.[38] Morris regularly makes predictions about candidates' chances of winning elections during these appearances.\nRegarding the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, he initially stated that Howard Dean's candidacy could be written off right away. He had earlier discussed the likelihood of Dean defeating John Kerry after early strong showings by the former Vermont governor. Kerry defeated Dean and all his other rivals and won the nomination.\nIn a column in The Hill on June 22, 2005, Morris predicted that Hillary Clinton would face her \"worst nightmare\" in her 2006 Senate race against Republican candidate Judge Jeanine Pirro, whose campaign subsequently collapsed within a matter of two months after repeated crushing defeats in the opinion polls due to her husband's alleged Mafia ties. He even went so far as to suggest that Hillary Clinton would drop out to focus on her 2008 presidential campaign.[39][40]\nIn 2005 Morris wrote that Hurricane Katrina \"has the capacity to shape the second Bush term in the same way September 11 shaped his first term\u2014not only in rebuilding New Orleans but in taking preventative steps around the nation to bolster our defenses against natural and man-made disasters and terror strikes. Responding to disasters is a source of presidential strength and popularity, and Bush is about to show how it is done.\"[41]\nIn August 2011, Morris began a petition on his website opposing federal funding for the Park51 Muslim community center, claiming that the center is \"designed to celebrate the attacks that killed 3,000 Americans\", and that the center would \"train the same kinds of terrorists who caused the... attacks\".\n\n2008 election[edit]\nIn a 2005 book on the 2008 presidential campaign, Morris stated that it was most likely that Hillary Clinton would face Condoleezza Rice for the presidency. Morris's critics reacted by mocking his mistaken predictions of past races. Appearing on Fox News' Hannity and Colmes on January 29, 2008, Morris said that those voting for John Edwards were \"at the moment... those that can't decide which they don't like more\u2014a black or a woman getting elected\". Morris elaborated that exit polls showed some Edwards voters were unsure if a woman or an African-American, in reference to then Democratic Primary front runners Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, could get elected to the presidency for the first time in 2008.[42]\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2008 election, Morris correctly predicted that Obama would win the election in a landslide, but incorrectly predicted that Obama would win Missouri, Arkansas, North Carolina, Arizona, Tennessee, and West Virginia by comfortable margins, while Louisiana, Georgia and South Carolina would be tossups. Of those states, Obama only won North Carolina in a close margin.[43]\nAfter Obama won the 2008 election, Morris was critical of him. In early 2009, Morris said: \"Those crazies in Montana who say, 'We're going to kill ATF agents because the UN's going to take over'? Well, they're beginning to have a case.\"[44] In April 2009, Morris keynoted an animated debate at the Yale Political Union on the topic \"Resolved: Save Capitalism from President Obama\".[45]\n\n2012 election[edit]\nDuring the 2012 United States presidential election, Morris received widespread attention for his inaccurate predictions and controversial statements about candidates. In a March 2011 column for The Hill, Morris predicted that Obama would not win a second term as president.[46] In July 2012, Morris predicted that Mitt Romney would choose Florida Senator Marco Rubio as his running mate as an effort to court the Latino vote; Romney ultimately chose Paul Ryan.[43] In August 2012, Morris predicted that Bill Clinton was going to vote for Mitt Romney, but that he would still speak in favor of Obama because \"his wife is hostage.\"[47]\nIn October 2012, Morris was a speaker at a special meeting of the Republican Caucus of the Georgia House of Representatives to discuss claims that Obama was using 'mind-control' techniques to create a Communist dictatorship controlled by the United Nations under the guise of promoting sustainability and public transportation. Speaking at the event, Morris argued that Obama's aim was to join with the United Nations to \"force everyone into the cities from whence our ancestors fled.\"[48]\nOn the day before the 2012 U.S. presidential election, Morris predicted on his website and in an article in The Hill that the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, would win the presidency in a landslide \"approaching the magnitude of Obama's against McCain.\" Specifically, he stated that Romney would win 325 electoral votes and that Obama would win 213.[49][50] Obama ended up winning 332 electoral votes with Romney winning 206, meaning Morris was off by 119 electoral votes. He explained the logic behind his prediction in a video posted at his website.[51] He made this prediction in the face of an overwhelming consensus among expert pollsters leading up to election night that Obama would win at least the Electoral College and likely the popular vote.[52] Morris wrote on his website, \"On Sunday, we changed our clocks. On Tuesday, we'll change our president.\"[50] With regard to his prognostications, Morris announced on Fox and Friends two days before the election that after the election \"either I'm gonna have to go through a big reckoning, or they [the mainstream pollsters] are.\"[53] Jon Stewart mocked the idea on The Daily Show, calling Dick Morris the \"King of Wrong Mountain\" and claiming that pundits live in a \"reckoning-free zone.\"[54] Morris was the least accurate major pundit in predicting the 2012 presidential election.[55]\nIn Morris's article in The Hill, he identified some \"key mistakes\" by the Obama campaign, which he stated would cost Obama the election:\n\nThe campaign \"bet the farm on negative ads in swing states.\"\nObama never moved to the political center.\nThe Obama campaign did not consider Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan or Minnesota swing states.\nObama \"became nothing more than a nasty partisan\" instead of trying to look presidential.\nObama offered nothing more than \"a grab-bag of special-interest pleadings for single women, unions, college kids and minorities\".\nObama underperformed in the first presidential debate.\nObama was slow to release information about the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi.\nObama returned to campaigning too quickly after Hurricane Sandy.\nOn November 7, 2012, the day after the election, Morris published an article in The Hill titled \"Why I was wrong\".[56] Morris stated that he had \"egg on his face\" and that the \"key reason for my bum prediction is that I believed, mistakenly, that the 2008 surge in black, Latino and young voter turnout would recede in 2012 to 'normal' levels. Didn't happen. These high levels of minority and young voter participation are here to stay. And, with them, a permanent reshaping of our nation's politics.\" In a subsequent interview on Fox News, Morris added: \"I called it as I saw it from the polling and I did the best I could and I also worked very hard for Romney.\" He elaborated on the latter point by explaining that he thought it was his duty to help the Romney campaign by countering pessimism about Romney's chances.[57]\n\nOther elections[edit]\nIn March 2021, it was reported by The New York Times that he was meeting with Donald Trump in New York, \"encouraging him to take on the party he once led\".[58]\n\nForeign political consultant[edit]\nMorris worked with the United Kingdom Independence Party in their campaign before the 2004 European Parliament election.[59] The party, which advocated withdrawal from the European Union, won 12 of the United Kingdom's 78 seats.[60]\nIn 2004 and 2005, he and his wife had acted as campaign consultants to the successful Yushchenko presidential campaign in Ukraine.[59] Morris reports that he insisted on the use of exit polls as a means of potentially exposing ballot tampering. He argues this played a significant role in forcing the government of then President Leonid Kuchma to acquiesce to a new poll when the official results of the first varied materially from the exit surveys. Faced with a similar (though smaller) divergence between exit polling and election returns, he took the opposite stance in a 2004 article in The Hill when he suspected \"foul play\" on the part of the exit pollsters in the US presidential race.[61]\nIn a November 13, 2007 press conference in Nairobi, Kenya, Morris announced that he would be offering his consultancy services pro bono for the campaign to elect Raila Odinga as President of Kenya in the 2007 presidential election running on the Orange Democratic Movement ticket. With four weeks to the national elections, an editorial in one of the leading dailies called into question the legalities of Morris' consulting work from the perspective of his presence in and lack of legal ability to work in Kenya \"pro bono\" or \"through the back door\".[62]\nThe outcome of the December 27, 2007, elections in Kenya is still disputed due to allegations of electoral fraud and rigging by the incumbent president, Mwai Kibaki, the Party of National Unity and erroneous reporting by the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK). Massive protests and tribal tensions have since erupted between the president's Kikuyu tribe and the majority of other tribes not favorably aligned to the outcome. Major mediations have commenced between concerned parties, including possible formation of a coalition and/or interim government until reelections are held.\n\nRadio and TV host[edit]\nFollowing the 2012 election, Morris did not appear on Fox News for almost three months. On February 5, 2013, Fox announced that it would not renew Morris' contract.[17] In addition to his numerous inaccurate predictions, Morris had been criticized for accepting paid ads on his Website from candidates whom he discussed on the air, a clear conflict of interest.[63]\nBeginning in 2013, Morris' Super PAC For America disbursed approximately $1.7mm for \"fundraising\" to the television network, Newsmax.[64] Emails from both Morris and Newsmax were paid for by Super PAC for America. Some media outlets speculate that Morris took advantage of Super PAC For America donations by paying Newsmax for fundraising which in turn paid Morris large sums of money to 'rent' his email list.[65][66] Morris was a regular guest on multiple Newsmax shows, such as American Agenda, Greg Kelly Reports and Spicer & Co.. In 2021, Morris launched a weekly half-hour show on Newsmax TV, Dick Morris Democracy.\nMorris was host of a daily radio talk show on WPHT in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 2013 to 2015. Morris cited his desire to campaign for 2016 Republican candidates as his reason for leaving.[67] In 2021, Morris launched a one-hour radio program on WABC in New York City, aired from noon to 1 PM on Sundays.\n\nFilm[edit]\nMorris has appeared in, and wrote the screenplay for, the documentary film FahrenHYPE 9/11. The film was a response to Michael Moore's 2004 film, Fahrenheit 9/11.\n\nPersonal life and tax problems[edit]\nMorris is married to Eileen McGann (author).\nHe failed to pay a variety of state and federal taxes beginning in 1996. In 2010, he declared that he had reached an agreement with the State of Connecticut, and that he is committed to paying his taxes: \"Following a difficult period in my life, I fell into arrears. But since then, I have paid almost $3 million in state and federal taxes.\"[68] In 2012, the lien that had been placed on his house was lifted.[69]\nMorris is a first cousin once removed of the late attorney Roy Cohn.[citation needed]\n\nBooks[edit]\nMorris has written several books, many co-authored with his wife, Eileen McGann. He authored Condi vs. Hillary in which he argues that only Condoleezza Rice could block Hillary Clinton's anticipated 2008 bid for the White House.\nRewriting History was published in May 2004 as a rebuttal to Hillary Clinton's book, Living History (ISBN\u00a00-7432-2224-5). In it, he argues that Hillary Clinton has presented a false \"nice\" persona in the book. Morris instead remembers her as manipulative, cold, and single-minded in her pursuit of power. Similarly, Morris and McGann wrote Because He Could in response to Bill Clinton's memoir My Life (ISBN\u00a00-375-41457-6).\n\nBibliography[edit]\nBehind the Oval Office: Winning the Presidency in the Nineties (1997) ISBN\u00a01-58063-053-7\nVote.com: How Big-Money Lobbyists and the Media Are Losing Their Influence, and the Internet Is Giving Power Back to the People (1999) ISBN\u00a0978-1580631051\nThe New Prince: Machiavelli Updated for the Twenty-First Century (2000) ISBN\u00a0978-1580630795\nPower Plays: Win or Lose \u2013 How History's Great Political Leaders Play the Game (2003) ISBN\u00a0978-0060004439\nRewriting History (2004) ISBN\u00a00-06-073668-2\nBecause He Could (2004, with Eileen McGann) ISBN\u00a00-06-078415-6\nCondi vs. Hillary: The Next Great Presidential Race (2005, with Eileen McGann) ISBN\u00a00-06-083913-9\nOutrage: How Illegal Immigration, the United Nations, Congressional Ripoffs, Student Loan Overcharges, Tobacco Companies, Trade Protection, and Drug Companies are Ripping Us Off ...And What to Do About It (2007, with Eileen McGann) ISBN\u00a0978-0061195402\nCatastrophe: How Obama, Congress, and the Special Interests Are Transforming a Slump Into a Crash, Freedom Into Socialism, and a Disaster Into a Catastrophe ...and How to Fight Back (2008, with Eileen McGAnn) ISBN\u00a0978-0061771040\nFleeced: How Barack Obama, Media Mockery of Terrorist Threats, Liberals Who Want To Kill Talk Radio, the Do-Nothing Congress, Companies That Help Iran, and Washington Lobbyists for Foreign Governments Are Scamming Us...And What To Do About It (2008, with Eileen McGann) ISBN\u00a0978-0-06-171866-3\nRevolt!
