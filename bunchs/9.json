For the Gaelic footballer, see Daniel McLaughlin.\nDan McLaughlinMcLaughlin in booth before a gameBorn (1974-03-18) March 18, 1974 (age\u00a049)[1]St. Louis, MissouriEducationLindenwood UniversityOccupationBroadcasterSpouseLibby\nDaniel Edwin McLaughlin (born March 18, 1974) is a professional sportscaster who formerly worked on the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Blues telecasts on the cable television channel Bally Sports Midwest.[2] He used to be a play-by-play announcer for the NFL on Fox.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nDan McLaughlin was born on March 18, 1974, in St. Louis, Missouri.[3] He grew up in the St. Louis area where his father was a school teacher. Following his graduation from St. John Vianney High School in suburban Kirkwood, Missouri, McLaughlin attended Lindenwood University in Saint Charles[4] where he played baseball. Setting his sights on sports broadcasting from an early age, McLaughlin performed a variety of broadcasting duties at university-owned KCLC while a student at Lindenwood.\n\nBroadcast career[edit]\nWhile in college, McLaughlin served an internship at KMOX radio in St. Louis, and he became a sports talk show host with the station in 1996.[2][5] McLaughlin soon found himself as a frequent contributor to St. Louis Blues telecasts on KPLR-TV and FSN Midwest. In 2000, he became the play-by-play broadcaster for FSN's Cardinals games.[1] Additionally, McLaughlin did play-by-play for the Mizzou Tiger and Missouri Valley Conference basketball games and occasional regional college football games for ESPN.[6]\nHe also owns a media company, Scoops with Danny Mac, where he interviews nationally-known sports figures for both a television show and podcast. Scoops with Danny Mac is known for candid one-on-one interviews between McLaughlin and his subject.[citation needed]\nBally Sports placed McLaughlin on leave in December of 2022 following his arrest for persistent driving while intoxicated.[7] Bally Sports announced it had parted ways with McLaughlin on December 15, 2022.[8]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMcLaughlin and wife, Libby, are the parents of two sons and two daughters. The McLaughlins are involved in several St. Louis area charities, including hosting the annual \"Dan McLaughlin Golf Tournament\" to benefit special education.[6]\n\nDrunk driving arrests[edit]\nOn August 16, 2010, McLaughlin was arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated. Under a plea agreement, he was allowed to keep his drivers license, but was given two years of probation.[9]\nOn September 30, 2011, McLaughlin was involved in a one-vehicle crash near his Chesterfield, Missouri, home. Police investigated and arrested McLaughlin on charges of drunk driving, and leaving the scene of an crash.[10] Following the second arrest, Fox Sports Midwest suspended McLaughlin indefinitely. [2][11] In addition to suspension from his job with Fox Sports, McLaughlin lost his regular appearances on KMOX radio. McLaughlin was reinstated by Fox in February 2012 after being treated for alcoholism at a rehab facility. He also returned to KMOX, but in a much more limited role.\nOn December 4, 2022, McLaughlin was once again arrested in Creve Coeur, Missouri, for driving under the influence.[12] He was charged with persistent driving while intoxicated, a felony offense.[13] On February 10, 2023, McLaughlin pleaded guilty to felony DWI and was referred to treatment court.[14] On February 13, 2023, McLaughlin released a statement on social media detailing his struggles with mental health and alcoholism.[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b St. Louis Cardinals 2006 Media Guide.

He was previously president of the Pride Corporation, a manufacturer of motorized wheelchairs in the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton metro area of Pennsylvania, and currently serves the company as a board member and consultant.[5] He has testified before Congress regarding the criticality for federal practices surrounding rights and caring for the disabled.\n\n\nBusiness career[edit]\nMeuser was an executive at Pride Mobility Products, a business he built with his brother Scott and his father Stan.[6] His brother, Scott Meuser, is the chairman and CEO of the company.[7] Meuser left the company in August 2008 to pursue a career in public service. He had worked there since 1988. Although he left his position, he remained on the company's board of directors.[8] During Meuser's tenure at Pride, the company grew from $2 million in sales to over $400 million.[9] In 2002, Pride paid $80,000 to settle a government investigation that a Pride customer referral program intended to connect interested consumers with Pride product retailers was not compliant because retailers were required to pay Pride between $10 and $25 per referral as opposed to a flat annual fee.[10]\nIn 2006, Meuser received HomeCare magazine's HomeCaring Award, which recognized his work in the home medical equipment industry.[9]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives[edit]\nElections[edit]\n2008[edit]\nSee also: 2008 United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania \u00a7\u00a0District 10\nMeuser was a candidate for the GOP nomination in Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district, having announced the launch of his campaign in September 2007. He lost the Republican primary to fellow businessman Chris Hackett, who went on to lose to Democratic incumbent Chris Carney in November 2008. Meuser heavily underscored his conservative values, referencing Ronald Reagan and emphasizing his work at Pride Mobility as part of a larger effort to embrace small-scale government and low taxes. The endorsements he received included many prominent Pennsylvania conservatives, including former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum and then-Hazleton mayor Lou Barletta.\nHackett attacked Meuser for hiring undocumented immigrants at Pride Mobility and funding prominent national Democratic politicians. In 1997, Pride Mobility was fined $41,000 for hiring three undocumented immigrants in 1995; the fine was reduced to $23,000 after Pride Mobility appealed.[11] The individuals in question had presented false documentation to Pride before technology like E-Verify was available. Pride took the incident seriously and took steps to ensure they wouldn't recur.[12]\nThe discovery that Hackett had previously hired an undocumented immigrant as a maid in his home\u2014though he claimed to have dismissed her once he learned of her status\u2014was perceived to seriously damage his image. On the night of the primary, the very close returns\u2014despite initially displaying a comfortable Meuser lead\u2014soon indicated a virtual tie for much of the night, with little more than 100 votes separating the candidates at one point. But as time passed, Hackett took a lead. By roughly 11:15\u00a0p.m. ET, local news media and the Associated Press projected Hackett as the winner, with 52% of the vote to Meuser's 48%.\nWhen Meuser ran for the 10th congressional district in 2008, he lived in the 11th congressional district, where Lou Barletta was running for Congress against incumbent Paul Kanjorski. Meuser promised that he would actually live in the district by the time voters cast their ballots in the primary election; he had purchased a house in Harvey's Lake, which is in the 10th district. He still resides in Dallas, Pennsylvania.[13]\n\n\n\n\"I am running because I love my country and I want a government people can have faith in again. My twenty-five years in business and four years as PA Secretary of Revenue have given me the experiences necessary to be an effective, conservative member of Congress.\"\n\n\nDan Meuser[14]\n\n\n2018[edit]\nSee also: 2018 United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania \u00a7\u00a0District 9\nMeuser was reelected in the 2018 general election with 59.7% of the vote, versus Denny Wolff's 40.3%.\n\n\nIn October 2017, Meuser announced that he would run as a Republican to represent Pennsylvania's 9th congressional district. The district had previously been the 11th, represented by Lou Barletta, who was running for the United States Senate.[15][16]\nIn March 2018, over 100 members of the Lebanon County Republican Committee endorsed Meuser. Meuser \"strongly backed\" President Donald Trump's \"America First agenda\".\nThe Republican primary candidates were Meuser, Scott Uehlinger and George Halcovage. The Democratic candidates were Susan Quick, Denny Wolff and Gary Wegman.[16] The primary election was held on May 15, 2018.[17]\nOn April 18, 2018, the Making America Great PAC endorsed Meuser. The PAC's chairman said, \"Dan is a business-minded problem solver, a conservative, and he is focused on results, not rhetoric. Dan will go to Washington and join President Trump to fight for the America First Agenda.\"[18]\nIn early May 2018, the Republican Committee of Columbia County met with all three candidates running for the 9th congressional district seat. After a series of questions about their campaign priorities, the committee voted to support Meuser.[19]\nAmong Meuser's local endorsements were Shamokin Mayor John Brown and City Councilman Dan McGaw.[20]\nBefore a debate in Berks County, Meuser told opponent Denny Wolff to \"go to hell\", which he originally denied before later acknowledging.[21]\nIn May 2018, Meuser's campaign announced an initiative called \"Women for Meuser\", a group of women supporters of Meuser for Congress.[22] Meuser was endorsed by at least 31 prominent elected or politically active women, including State Senator Lisa Baker, television host Tiffany Cloud, State Representative Tarah Toohil, State Representative Karen Boback, and Luzerne County District Attorney Stefanie Salavantis.[22]\n\n2020[edit]\nSee also: 2020 United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania \u00a7\u00a0District 9\nMeuser was reelected in 2020 with 66.3% of the vote, defeating Gary Wegman.[23]\n\nTenure[edit]\nIn December 2020, Meuser joined over 120 Republican members of the House of Representatives in signing an amicus brief in support of a Texas lawsuit that sought to invalidate Pennsylvania's 2020 presidential election votes. The Pennsylvania Attorney General called the case a \"seditious abuse of the judicial process\".[24][25] The Supreme Court issued orders on December 11, declining to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.[26][27]\nMeuser was a candidate to be the Republican Party nominee for Speaker of the House in the October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, but dropped out on October 23, 2023.[28]\n\nCommittee assignments[edit]\nCommittee on Education and Labor\nSubcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Investment\nSubcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions\nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs\nSubcommittee on Health\nSubcommittee on Economic Opportunity\nCommittee on the Budget\nCaucus memberships[edit]\nHouse Aluminum Caucus\nCongressional Candy Caucus\nBipartisan Military Depot and Industrial Facilities Caucus\nHouse Small Brewers Caucus\nCongressional Fire Services Caucus\nCongressional Coal Caucus\nCongressional Chemistry Caucus\nCopper Caucus\nCongressional Cigar Caucus[29]\nServicewomen & Women Veterans Congressional Caucus\nHouse Paper and Packaging Caucus\nRepublican Main Street Partnership[30]\nRepublican Study Committee[31]\nProblem Solvers Caucus[32]\n\n\nElectoral history[edit]\n2018[edit]\n\nRepublican primary results\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDan Meuser \n\n26,568 \n\n53.0 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nGeorge Halcovage Jr.\n\n12,032\n\n24.0\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nScott Uehlinger\n\n11,541\n\n23.0\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n50,141 \n\n100.0 \n\n\n\nPennsylvania's 9th congressional district, 2018\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDan Meuser \n\n148,723 \n\n59.7 \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nDenny Wolff\n\n100,204\n\n40.3\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n248,927 \n\n100.0 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican hold\n\n\n2020[edit]\n\nPennsylvania's 9th congressional district, 2020[33]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDan Meuser (incumbent) \n\n232,988 \n\n66.3 \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nGary Wegman\n\n118,266\n\n33.7\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n351,254 \n\n100.0 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican hold\n\n\n2022[edit]\n\nPennsylvania's 9th congressional district, 2022[34]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDan Meuser (incumbent) \n\n209,185 \n\n69.3 \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nAmanda Waldman\n\n92,622\n\n30.7\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n301,807 \n\n100.0 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican hold\n\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nAbortion[edit]\nMeuser opposes legalized abortion and has called fetuses \"pre-born human persons.\"[16] According to his campaign, \"Dan has personally funded chartered buses to take people from our area to the annual March for Life Rally in Washington, D.C.\"[35] He opposes federal funding for abortion and federal health coverage that includes abortion services. He also believes that \"equal protection must be granted to each born and pre-born human person via the United States Constitution under the 14th Amendment\".[35]\n\nDefense and military[edit]\nMeuser supported Trump's plan to add $54 billion increase in defense spending. He also supported the travel ban on countries that Trump implemented, with his campaign saying, \"We cannot allow individuals to enter our country without knowing enough about their identity and background and the need to improve our immigration vetting processes, end visa overstays and examine the issues of chain migration. We can no longer stand by and allow individuals we know little about from countries hell-bent on destroying America enter our country.\"[36]\n\nDonald Trump[edit]\nMeuser greeting President Donald Trump in March 2020\nAs the House of Representatives was debating HR 489 in July 2019, which passed 240 - 187,[37] condemning Trump for promoting racism and xenophobia after he attacked four Democratic members of Congress, telling them to \"go back\" to the \"places from which they came,\" Meuser defended Trump and called the bill a baseless attack by Democratic leadership. \"I strongly oppose Democrat leadership's latest effort to harass [Trump]. For years, he and his supporters have been subjected to baseless attacks. Such slander is a disservice to our nation and the American people, and I am tired of it.\"[38] The tweet from which the quote is sourced contained a video in which Meuser, standing on the House floor, said, \"I rise today in opposition of House Resolution 489.\"[39]\nIn December 2020, Meuser joined over 120 House Republicans in signing an amicus brief in support of a Texas lawsuit that sought to invalidate Pennsylvania's 2020 presidential election votes.[40] Following the storming of the U.S. Capitol building by Trump supporters, Meuser voted to reject the certification of Pennsylvania's 's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election.[41] He voted against impeaching Trump on an article of impeachment of \"incitement of insurrection\" in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol.[42] In May 2021, Meuser voted against the creation of an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack.[43]\n\nDrugs[edit]\nMeuser supported Trump's declaration of the opioid epidemic as a national health emergency. He has proposed a three-pronged approach: supply (by increasing the standards by which prescription opioids are prescribed), harm reduction (by having medication drop off programs in communities and by incrementing electronic databases for monitoring opioid prescriptions), and recovery (by coordinating efforts to help non-violent drug offenders become rehabilitated as productive members of society).[44] Meuser voted against the MORE Act, which would have removed cannabis from the federal Controlled Substances Act.[45]\n\nGuns[edit]\nMeuser supports an individual right to keep, own, use and carry firearms, earning an endorsement from at least one pro-gun Political Action Campaign.[46]\n\nImmigration[edit]\nMeuser supported Trump's proposal to construct a wall on the entire border with Mexico. He opposes giving federal funds to sanctuary cities. Meuser has argued that President Obama's executive order on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was unconstitutional and supports ending DACA. He also supports the government cracking down on employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.[47]\nMeuser sponsored H.R. 6202, the American Tech Workforce Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Jim Banks. The legislation would establish a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program. The bill would also eliminate the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States.[48]\n\nLGBT rights[edit]\nOn July 19, 2022, Meuser and 46 other Republican Representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.[49] Meuser said, \"My vote in support of H.R. 8404 was to affirm the current law and support the rights and freedoms of all Americans. The passage of this legislation reflects current law, which was upheld by a Supreme Court ruling nearly 10 years ago. This vote was not difficult for me, as it does not infringe upon anyone\u2019s personal and religious rights.\"[50] However, Meuser voted against final passage on December 8, 2022.[51]\n\nTaxes[edit]\nMeuser believes that school property taxes are un-American and unconstitutional, his campaign stating \"no tax should have the power to leave you homeless.\" He has also cited the 14th amendment in arguing that the government has no right to take property away from someone without due process of law or providing equal protections under the law.[52]\nMeuser signed the \"Taxpayer Protection Pledge\" sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform. The pledge commits its signers to \"oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses ... and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates\".[53]\n\nTexas v. Pennsylvania[edit]\nIn December 2020, Meuser was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated[54] Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.[26][27][55]\n\nUkraine[edit]\nIn 2023, Meuser was among 98 Republicans to vote for a ban on cluster munitions to Ukraine.[56][57]\nIn 2023, Meuser voted for a moratorium on aid to Ukraine.[58][59]\n\nVeterans[edit]\nMeuser supports the Veterans Choice Act, legislation passed during the Obama administration and extended by Congress during the Trump administration. The policy allows veterans who face long waiting times at VA facilities or live over 40 miles away from the nearest VA clinic to seek care in the private sector, and have the cost of that care covered.[60]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nPennsylvania Secretary of Revenue[edit]\nMeuser was appointed Secretary of Revenue by Governor Tom Corbett after more than two decades in the private sector. The secretary's primary duties include administration and enforcement of state tax laws, effectively operating within reduced budget climate, collections of over 30 state taxes, setting annual state budget projections, developing tax policy for the governor and overseeing the growth and stability of the Pennsylvania Lottery, which generates gross sales of $3.6 billion and net revenue of $1.1 billion annually.\nThe Council On State Taxation (COST) gave PA an A\u2212 rating partly due to legislation that Meuser helped pass and the reforms he put into place.[61] Pennsylvania residents speculated about his appointment by Corbett given that he was one of the largest donors to Corbett's 2009\u20132010 campaign, making a total of 26 contributions totaling $76,394.[62] There is concern over a recent $103 million computer modernization system for the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue being performed by Accenture, a global technology consultant that the state of Maryland had previously fired by for a similar project due to wasteful spending and missed deadlines.[63]\nIn 2010, Politics Magazine called Meuser a \"Former Congressional candidate and northeast PA money man\".[64]\n\nPhilanthropy and boards[edit]\nMeuser is a board member of the Greater Pittston Chamber of Commerce, sits on the board of trustees for Misericordia University, and is on the board of the Pittston Young Men's Christian Association.[65]\nMeuser is a donor to such organizations as United Way, Make-A-Wish Foundation, MS Society, St Jude Hospital, and St. Joseph's Hospital.[6]\n\nPersonal[edit]\nMeuser is married to Shelley Van Acker Meuser. They have three children.[35] He once claimed a home in Kingston Township as his residence, but changed his registration to a home in Dallas two months before the election. The Kingston home had been drawn into the 8th district after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court threw out Pennsylvania's old congressional map as an unconstitutional gerrymander. According to Meuser, his old home had been drawn just a mile outside the new 9th's borders.[66] Meuser is Roman Catholic.[67]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Daniel P.

The Commission's objectives are to ensure that public officials act in a fair and unbiased manner in the governmental decision-making process, to promote transparency in government, and to foster public trust in the political system.[1]\nThe Commission is similar to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in its campaign finance responsibilities. It differs from the FEC in its authority in lobbying and conflicts of interest.\nIt was created by California Proposition 9 in the June 1974 elections, known as the Political Reform Act of 1974, regulates campaign financing, conflicts of interest, lobbying, and governmental ethics.[1]\n\n\nOrganization[edit]\n\n\nCommissioner\n\nPosition\n\nTerm\n\nAppointing Officer\n\n\nRichard C.

    "wiki": "American journalist (born 1968)\nDana MilbankBornDana Timothy Milbank (1968-04-27) April 27, 1968 (age\u00a055)EducationYale University (BA)Spouses\nDonna DePasquale\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01993; div.\u00a02015)\u200b\nAnna Greenberg \u200b(m.\u00a02017)\u200b\nDana Timothy Milbank (born April 27, 1968)[1][2] is an American author and columnist for The Washington Post. He has written books about Al Gore & George Bush, Glenn Beck, American politics, and the Republican Party. He has appeared as a pundit on various shows.\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMilbank was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ann C. and Mark A. Milbank.[3][4] He is a graduate of Yale University, where he was a member of Trumbull College, the Progressive Party of the Yale Political Union and the secret society Skull and Bones.[5][6] He is a graduate of Sanford H. Calhoun High School in Merrick, New York.\nIn 1993, Milbank married Donna Lynn DePasquale in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic ceremony.[4] After that marriage ended in divorce, in 2017 he married Anna Greenberg, daughter of Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg and stepdaughter of Democratic Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (CT).[7]\n\nCareer[edit]\nMilbank covered the 2000 and the 2004 presidential elections. He also covered President George W. Bush's first term in office.  After Bush won the 2000 election, Karl Rove asked The Washington Post not to assign Milbank to cover White House news.[8] In 2001, a pool report penned by Milbank which covered a Bush visit to the U.S. Capitol generated controversy within conservative circles.[9]  According to Milbank, the nickname given to him by the president is \"not printable in a family publication.\"[10]\nMilbank writes \"Washington Sketch\" for the Post, an observational column about political theater in the White House, Congress, and elsewhere in the capital. Before coming to the Post as a political writer in 2000, he covered the Clinton White House for The New Republic and Congress for The Wall Street Journal.\nMilbank was criticized for a July 30, 2008 article[11] in which, in part by using snippets of quotations, he portrayed Barack Obama as being presumptuous.[12][13] A few days later MSNBC's Keith Olbermann stated that Milbank would not be allowed back onto his show, which Milbank had appeared on since 2004, until Milbank submitted \"a correction or an explanation.\"[14] However, Milbank had apparently already left Olbermann's show for another show on CNN.[15] \nMilbank stated that he has been dissatisfied since he was criticized by Olbermann's staff over making a positive comment about Charlie Black, a John McCain senior advisor, and as a result had already been negotiating with CNN.[16]\nMilbank and Chris Cillizza appeared in a series of humor videos called \"Mouthpiece Theater\" which appeared on The Washington Post's website.  An outcry followed a video in which, during a discussion of the White House \"Beer Summit\", they chose new brands for a number of people, including \"Mad Bitch Beer\" for Hillary Clinton.  Both men apologized for the video and the series was canceled.[17]\nIn a December 4, 2021 Op-ed, Milbank wrote that overall US media sentiment for President Joe Biden is as bad as, if not worse than, it was for then-President Donald Trump. He used data from the analytics company Forge.ai to mine through more than 200,000 articles from 65 different news sources to create a \"sentiment analysis\" of pro or con coverage. The comparison was done of the first 11 months of the Trump administration versus the same timeframe of the Biden term. His analysis showed that Biden had had mainly positive coverage for the first three months of the year, but the press covered Biden more harshly than Trump in the past four months.[18] Nate Silver, of FiveThirtyEight, questioned Milbank's conclusion.[19]\n\nBooks[edit]\nMilbank is the author of Smash Mouth: Two Years in the Gutter with Al Gore and George W. Bush\u2014Notes from the 2000 Campaign Trail.\nHomo Politicus: The Strange and Scary Tribes that Run Our Government was published by Random House in January 2008.[20]\nIn 2010, Doubleday released Milbank's polemic biography of conservative pundit Glenn Beck: Tears of a Clown: Glenn Beck and the Tea Bagging of America,[21] which a review in Milbank's paper, The Washington Post, said was a \"droll, take-no-prisoners account of the nation's most audacious conspiracy-spinner.\"[22]\nIn 2022, Milbank authored The Destructionists: The 25-Year Crack-Up of the Republican Party.[23]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nMilbank has stated that his policy on United States presidential elections is to vote for the best candidate who is not on the ballot. He voted for John McCain in 2000, Chuck Hagel in 2004, and Michael Bloomberg in 2008. He explained that his approach allows him to \"go through the exercise of who would be a good president\" while avoiding committing to one candidate or another in the race.[24]\nGreg Marx, associate editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, describes Milbank as \"extravagantly contrarian\".[25] New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen wrote of \"Milbank's insistence on characterizing political debate as consisting of two unreasonable poles, and himself as a truth-teller caught in the middle \u2014 a posture so habitual and inflexible that it has become an ideology\".[25]\nMilbank has criticized the growth of the White House Correspondents' Dinner, writing in 2011 that the event \"was a minor annoyance for years, when it was a 'nerd prom' for journalists and a few minor celebrities. But, as with so much else in this town, the event has spun out of control. Now, awash in lobbyist and corporate money, it is another display of Washington's excesses.\"[26][27]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Lippman, Daniel (2017-04-27). \"BIRTHDAY OF THE DAY: WaPo columnist Dana Milbank, the pride of Merrick, NY\".

Known for his energetic style of boogie-woogie piano,[1] Davis has played with such musicians as Chuck Berry,[1][2] Jerry Lee Lewis, B. B. King,[2] and Bruce Hornsby.[3][4]\nHe is the subject of the 2016 documentary Accidental Courtesy: Daryl Davis, Race & America.[5][6]\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Davis was the son of a Department of State Foreign Service officer and moved around the world with his parents during most of his early childhood. Living in various foreign countries, including African nations, Davis grew accustomed to the casually integrated schools of foreign diplomats, where children of many nations, races, and cultures were schooled together. At the age of ten, he returned to the United States and joined what had previously been an all-white Cub Scout pack in Belmont, Massachusetts. During a local parade with his pack, he was carrying the flag when he was struck with rocks and bottles thrown from the crowd, prompting the pack leaders to form a protective ring around him. Davis did not understand the incident until he discussed it with his father. In this conversation, his father explained racism to him for the first time. The irrationality of the incident led to his curiosity about the origins and basis for racist attitudes, which would shape much of his future activity.[7][8]\nDavis is a Christian.[9]\n\nMusic career[edit]\nDavis absorbed the style of blues musicians from the Mississippi Delta who had migrated north.[10] In 1980, he earned a bachelor of music degree from Howard University, where he was a member of the Howard University Choir and Jazz Vocal Ensemble. Davis \"was mentored by legendary pianists Pinetop Perkins and Johnnie Johnson, who both claimed him as their godson and praised his ability to master a piano style that was popular long before he was born\", according to his Kennedy Center profile.[3]\nDavis has frequently played backup for Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis.[1][2][11][12] He was a friend of Muddy Waters and played piano in The Legendary Blues Band.[12] Davis has also performed with blues icon B. B. King.[2] He has played with artists such as Elvis Presley's Jordanaires, The Platters, The Drifters, The Coasters, Bo Diddley,[12] Percy Sledge, and Sam Moore (of Sam & Dave).[10]\nHe was awarded \"Best Traditional Blues/R&B Instrumentalist\" at the 2009 Washington Area Music Awards. For several years, Davis served as artistic director of the Centrum Acoustic Blues Festival.[13]\n\"Davis' piano work impresses with his winning combination of technique and abandon, and his vocals are strong and assured\", wrote a reviewer in Living Blues Magazine.[14]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nAmerican Roots (2000)\nAlternate Routes (2008)\nGreatest Hits (2011)\nActivism[edit]\nDavis holding up KKK robes at Blues and Rock for Humanity in November 2017\n\n\nWhat I have come to find to be the greatest and most effective and successful weapon that we can use, known to man, to combat such adversaries as ignorance, racism, hatred, violence, is also the least expensive weapon, and the one that is the least used by Americans. That weapon is called communication.\n\n\nDaryl Davis, \"Klan We Talk?\", TEDxCapeMay, 9 January 2018.\n\n\nDavis has worked to improve race relations by seeking out, engaging in dialogue with, and befriending members of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1983, he was playing country western music in a \"white\" bar in Frederick, Maryland, when a patron came up to him and said it was the first time he had \"heard a black man play as well as Jerry Lee Lewis\". Davis explained to the man that \"Jerry Lee learned to play from black blues and boogie-woogie piano players and he's a friend of mine\". The white patron was skeptical and over a drink admitted he was a member of the KKK. The two became friends and eventually the man gave Davis contact information on KKK leaders.[15][16][17]\nA few years later, Davis decided that he wanted to interview Klan members and write a book on the subject, to answer a \"question in my head from the age of 10: 'Why do you hate me when you know nothing about me?' That question had never been answered from my youth\".[18]\nIn meeting with the Imperial Wizard of the KKK in Maryland, Roger Kelly, Davis concealed his race before the interview.\n\n My secretary called him, and I told her, 'do not tell Roger Kelly I'm black. Just tell him I am writing a book on the Klan'. I wanted her to call because she's white. I knew enough about the mentality of the Klan that they would never think a white woman would work for a black man.  She called him and he didn't ask what color I was, so we arranged to meet at a motel.[18]\nThe meeting was tense. Kelly arrived at the motel with a bodyguard armed with a gun. Davis eventually became friends with Kelly[16][8]  and was later invited to be Kelly's daughter's godfather.[8]  When Kelly left the Klan, he gave his robe to Davis.[8]\nDavis eventually went on to befriend over twenty members of the KKK,[16] and claims to have been directly responsible for between forty and sixty, and indirectly over two hundred people leaving the Klan.[19] Over the course of his activities, Davis found that Klansmen have many misconceptions about black people, stemming mostly from intense brainwashing in their youth. When they got to know him, Davis claims, it was more difficult to maintain their prejudices. The artist has recounted his experiences in his 1998 book, Klan-destine Relationships: A Black Man's Odyssey in the Ku Klux Klan.\nKlan members have often invited Davis to meetings, and they have given him their robes and hoods.[16] In 2016, Davis estimated having collected 25 or 26 robes.[20]:\u200a1h18m\u200a Among the \"Knights of the Ku Klux Klan\" he interviewed were Grand Klaliff Chester Doles, Grand Giant Tony LaRicci, and Grand Giant Bob White, according to The Washington Post.[21] One Klan member gave Davis a medallion stamped with the words \"KKK\u2014Member in good standing\".\nDavis claims to be responsible for helping to dismantle the KKK in Maryland because things \"fell apart\" after he began making inroads with its members there.[16][22] However, since then, the KKK was rebuilt in Maryland [23] under Richard Preston, leader of the Confederate White Knights, who was arrested for firing his gun at counterprotesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.[24] Davis offered to post Preston's bail.[25] He later took Preston to the National Museum of African American History. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to give away the bride at Preston's wedding.[26]\n\"The lesson learned is: ignorance breeds fear\", says Davis. \"If you don't keep that fear in check, that fear will breed hatred. If you don't keep hatred in check, it will breed destruction\".[21]\nChester Doles, a member of the Klan, was convinced that Davis was a spy for the Anti-Defamation League or some other Klan-buster, and some of Davis's friends have found his fascination with the Klan to be odd. \"He's attracted to controversy\", says Adolph Wright, an old friend and fellow musician who believes Davis is a bit eccentric. \"When the crowd goes right, he goes left\", Wright told the Post.[21]\nDavis's father, retired senior Foreign Service officer William B. Davis, believed that his son engaged with the Klan because he needed to make sense of their hatred, to seek common ground. He remarked to The Washington Post that his son \"has done something that I don't know any other black American, or white American, has done\".[21]\n\nAccidental Courtesy documentary[edit]\nIn the 2016 documentary film Accidental Courtesy: Daryl Davis, Race & America, Davis interacts with KKK members and white supremacists, and provides contrasting views of his activities from members of the Southern Poverty Law Center and Black Lives Matter.[27]\n\nMinds social network[edit]\nDaryl Davis is an official advisor to the decentralized social network Minds.[28][29] He uses the platform to educate people on how to conduct civil discourse to find common ground and build tolerance.[29]\nIn an interview with Forbes, Davis said \"\u2026here [at Minds] you have an open forum where people are welcomed to bring their diverse ideas, even their beliefs, which people may not find popular and have civil discourse\u2026the art of conversing with one another has been lost\u2026 This forum will allow people to come on there and be able to be transparent, to have conversation unlike some of the other platforms on the internet\".[30]\nDavis believes education is the best remedy for curing hate: \"[If] you fix the ignorance, there's nothing to fear. If there's nothing to fear, there's nothing to hate. If there's nothing to hate, there's nothing or no one to destroy\".[31]\nIn November 2019, Minds and Davis launched the Deradicalization Initiative to combat online extremism.[32][28] In addition to workshops, meetups, and other live events, the initiative offers educational resources and ideas for promoting tolerance.[33]\n\nChanging Minds podcast[edit]\nAs part of the Deradicalization Initiative, Davis runs a podcast called Changing Minds. The show covers a wide range of topics, including politics, music, and race. Guests are equally diverse and have included notable figures such as:\n\nFormer Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard Scott Shepherd.[34]\nFormer Al-Qaeda recruiter Jesse Morton.[35]\nDavid Kaczynski, brother of \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski\nCharles Berry Jr., Chuck Berry's son.[36]\nBlues guitarist Bob Margolin\nDocumentary film director and human rights activist Deeyah Khan\nJournalist and author Brian Karem\nActing[edit]\nDavis has acted on stage, film, and television. He played a minor character in HBO's television series The Wire. He appeared on stage in William Saroyan's The Time of Your Life with Marcia Gay Harden, Brigid Cleary, and Richard Bauer, and in Elvis Mania at an off-Broadway theater in New York City. He received positive reviews for his role in Zora Neale Hurston's Polk County.[37]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d \"Class of 88 \u2013 Celebrating Chuck Berry: Jon Carroll, Daryl Davis & Josh Christina...

A member of the Republican Party, Yost previously served as Ohio State Auditor.\n\n\nEducation and career[edit]\nYost graduated from Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism. He earned a Juris Doctor from the Capital University Law School.[1]\nAfter earning his bachelor's degree, Yost became a journalist with the Columbus Citizen-Journal.[2]  He later served in senior positions within the administration of Columbus Mayor Buck Rinehart and Ohio Governor George Voinovich.[3] Yost was appointed Delaware County Auditor in 1999.[4] In 2003, he became the Delaware County Prosecutor.[5]\nIn September 2019, Yost was one out of nine state attorneys general that launched an antitrust investigation into Facebook and Google, to investigate whether or not they were stifling competition in their respective fields.[6][7]\nIn mid-March 2023, about five weeks after the Feb. 3 East Palestine train derailment, Republican AG Yost made the news with his announcement of Ohio's 58-count civil damages lawsuit against Norfolk Southern for its \"glaring negligence\" and prioritizing profits over communities' safety.[8][9]\n\nAbortion[edit]\nFollowing the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, Yost filed a successful motion to dissolve the injunction on Ohio's six-week abortion ban.[10] On June 24, 2022, Yost tweeted that \"The Heartbeat Bill is now the law.\" He released a video statement on YouTube the same day in which he said, \"This decision returns abortion policy to the place it has always belonged: to the elected policies branches of the governments.\"[11]\nYost's son and daughter-in-law publicly criticized his actions in messages on Facebook on June 24 and 25, the former saying, \"[T]he lack of pro choice is blatantly against what this country says it is on its banners and documents. The land of the free doesn't seem so free right now.\"[12]\nOn June 30, 2022, shortly after the ban became effective, a 10-year-old rape victim who was \"six weeks and three days\" pregnant traveled from the Columbus area to Indianapolis, Indiana, to get an abortion to avoid carrying her rapist's child.[13][14][15] The incident was widely reported, beginning with an article in the Indianapolis Star newspaper on July 1, and was mentioned by President Joe Biden on July 8, 2022, in comments at the White House.[16] On July 11, Yost disputed the report, saying that neither his office or the state crime lab had any information on the matter, and that his staff had heard \"not a whisper\" about it; in an interview on July 12, Yost said it was \"more likely that this is a fabrication\".[17] That day, the report was confirmed by the Columbus Division of Police and a rape suspect was arrested.[18]\nOn July 14, Yost's office shared a backgrounder with media and on Twitter[19] which listed specific exceptions contained in Ohio's \"Heartbeat Law\", and suggested, as had Yost in interviews on July 11, that the 10-year-old girl would have been able to obtain a legal abortion under those exceptions. The Ohio Legislative Commission said that nothing in the language of the law explicitly includes the age of the person seeking an abortion as a qualification for exception, and that it was unclear whether the girl would have qualified for a legal abortion.[20][21]  The following week, Yost rejected calls from the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party and others for his resignation.[22]\n\nAttempt to invalidate 2020 presidential election results[edit]\nAfter Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, Yost filed a \"friend-of-the-court\" brief in support of the Trump campaign's attempt to invalidate ballots cast in Pennsylvania.[23][24] However, in December 2020, Yost opposed a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton which sought to subvert the presidential election results and prevent Biden from being certified as the winner.[25]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nYost and his wife Darlene live in Franklin County, Ohio. They have three children and four grandchildren.[26]\n\nSwatting[edit]\nOn December 28, 2023, Yost was swatted, along with other Ohio Republican politicians, during the 2023 swatting of American politicians.[27]\n\nElectoral history[edit]\nYost was elected Ohio's 32nd state auditor in November 2010.[28]  In January 2017 he announced he was running for Ohio Attorney General in 2018.[29]\n\n\n\nOhio Auditor Republican Primary Election, 2010\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDave Yost\n\n457,820\n\n64.88\n\n\nRepublican\n\nSeth Morgan\n\n247,848\n\n35.12\n\n\n\nOhio Auditor Election, 2010\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDave Yost\n\n1,882,010\n\n50.22\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nDavid Pepper\n\n1,683,330\n\n44.91\n\n\nLibertarian\n\nMichael Howard\n\n182,534\n\n4.87\n\n\n\nOhio Auditor Election, 2014\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDave Yost (inc.)\n\n1,711,927\n\n56.98\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nJohn Patrick Carney\n\n1,149,305\n\n38.25\n\n\nLibertarian\n\nBob Bridges\n\n143,363\n\n4.77\n\n\n\nOhio Attorney General Election, 2018\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDave Yost\n\n2,272,440\n\n52.16\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nSteve Dettelbach\n\n2,084,593\n\n47.84\n\n\n\nOhio Attorney General Election, 2022\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDave Yost\n\n2,484,753\n\n60.1\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nJeffrey Crossman\n\n1,647,644\n\n39.9\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"StackPath\". fedsoc.org.

He is the sports editor for The Nation, a weekly progressive magazine dedicated to politics and culture, and writes a blog named Edge of Sports: the weekly sports column by Dave Zirin.[1] As of January 2022, he has authored eleven books.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nZirin was born in New York City.[2] He is of Jewish descent.[3][4] He graduated from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.[2]\n\nCareer[edit]\nZirin was the host of the Edge of Sports Podcast, hosted by the Slate/Panoply network.  He also co-hosted \"The Collision: Where Sports and Politics Collide on Pacifica Radio\" with former NBA player Etan Thomas. Zirin is a contributor to The Nation, and has been a columnist for SLAM Magazine, and The Progressive. He has been a guest on ESPN's Outside The Lines and Democracy Now!.[5][6]\nHis first book, What\u2019s My Name, Fool? Sports and Resistance in the United States (Haymarket Books) has entered its third printing.[5][7]\nZirin has published Welcome to the Terrordome: The Pain, Politics, and Promise of Sports, and A People\u2019s History of Sports in the United States, a sports-related volume in the manner of Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States series for The New Press.[5][8] In addition to \u201cWhat\u2019s My Name, Fool?\u201d, he has also published \u201cThe Muhammad Ali Handbook\u201d for MQ Publications.[9] Zirin is also the published children's book author of \u201cMy Name is Erica Montoya de la Cruz\u201d (RC Owen).[10]  \"A People's History of Sports\" forms the basis of a documentary co-written and narrated by Zirin called Not Just A Game: Power, Politics and American Sports, produced by the Media Education Foundation.[11]\nZirin is the co-author with John Carlos of The John Carlos Story: The Sports Moment That Changed the World (Haymarket Books, 2011).[11]\nHe writes a blog named Edge of Sports: the weekly sports column by Dave Zirin.[1]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nZirin has repeatedly called for sports boycotts of certain teams, states, or nations for political reasons.\n\nCall for boycott of Arizona[edit]\nOn April 27, 2010, writing for The Guardian, Zirin called for a boycott against sports teams from Arizona, in particular the Diamondbacks, to protest the Arizona SB 1070, the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act.[12][13][unreliable source?] He expressed support during the 2010 NBA Playoffs for the Phoenix Suns, who went by \"Los Suns\" as a statement against the Arizona immigration law.[14]\n\nSupport of boycotts of Israel[edit]\nOn June 2, 2010, writing for The Nation, Zirin justified the decision of the Turkish U-19 soccer team to boycott a match against Israel. He described the Gaza flotilla raid as an act of state terror committed by the Israeli government and proposed a boycott of Israel.[15]\n\nCriticism of Hank Williams, Jr.[edit]\nOn October 6, 2011, during a live interview conducted on the sports cable television network, ESPN, Zirin referred to Hank Williams, Jr. as racist and proslavery after Williams, the writer and singer of ESPN's then-Monday Night Football theme song, made a political statement in which he compared multiracial US President Barack Obama to former German national socialist leader, Adolf Hitler.[16]\n\nDefense of Barry Bonds[edit]\nIn an undated interview, Zirin claims \u201cI never wrote that I \"believe Bonds has never done steroids.\"\u201d He continues: \u201cunlike oh so many others, the man never actually failed a steroids test. Is there a ton of circumstantial evidence that the man juiced? Absolutely. But he is still the best player I've ever seen. The best player of what will go down as the anabolic era.\u201d[17][unreliable source?] Zirin claims that, rather than steroid use, \u201cmuch of the reaction to Bonds is simply bad old-fashioned racism\u201d.[18]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nWhat's My Name, Fool?
