He was the senior national affairs writer for The Wall Street Journal from 1993 to 2000, where he won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for articles that became the starting point for his first book, A Hope in the Unseen. His other books include The Price of Loyalty, The One Percent Doctrine, The Way of the World, Confidence Men, and his memoir Life, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism, from which he made an Emmy Award-winning, Academy Award-nominated feature documentary. Suskind has written about the George W. Bush administration, the Barack Obama administration, and related issues of the United States' use of power.\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\nSuskind was born in Kingston, New York, to a Jewish family.[3] He is the son of Shirley Berney and Walter B. Suskind,[1]  and a second cousin of producer David Susskind.[4] He grew up in Wilmington, Delaware, and graduated from Concord High School, after which he attended the University of Virginia. In 1983 he received a master's degree from Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.\nIn 1990, Suskind went to The Wall Street Journal, and became senior national affairs reporter in 1993. In 1995, he won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for two articles on Cedric Jennings, a student at inner-city Ballou High School in Washington, D.C. who wanted to attend MIT.[5][6] Suskind left the Journal in 2000.\nSuskind has written six books, and he has published in such periodicals as Esquire and The New York Times Magazine. In 2004, he discussed his book The Price of Loyalty on CBS's 60 Minutes. In 2006 he discussed The One Percent Doctrine on The Colbert Report, and in 2008 he discussed The Way of the World on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,[7] and again appeared on the show when his 2011 book, Confidence Men, was published. He has also appeared on NBC's Today Show, ABC's Nightline and PBS's Charlie Rose. In 2001 and 2002, he was a contributor to \"Life 360,\" a joint production of ABC and PBS. Between 2004 and 2008, he made appearances on Frontline, the PBS series.  On May 13, 2014, he appeared on The Daily Show to discuss his book Life, Animated, the real-life story of his autistic son, Owen Suskind, and \"his irrepressible wife,\" Cornelia.[8]\nIn the spring of 2012, Suskind was the A.M. Rosenthal Writer-in-Residence at the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. At the Shorenstein Center he conducted four workshops for students about the process of reporting and writing titled, \"Truth and Consequences: Crafting Powerful Narratives in the Age of Message.\"[9][10]\nSuskind has two sons with his wife, Cornelia Anne Kennedy Suskind. The couple married in 1988.[1] Cornelia is the granddaughter of Democratic Representative Martin J. Kennedy.[1]\n\nArticles[edit]\nIn 2002, Suskind wrote two articles in Esquire on the workings of the George W. Bush White House. The first article, in June 2002, focused on presidential adviser Karen Hughes. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card said that the pragmatic Hughes was \"the beauty to Karl's beast\", referring to Bush's advisor Karl Rove. According to Card, her resignation signified a political shift in the administration further to the right. Suskind's second Esquire story about Rove, in December 2002, carried the comments and a long memo from Bush's former head of the White House Office of Faith-based and Community initiatives John DiIulio, an official who left the White House and spoke about his experiences. DiIulio criticized the Bush administration for having \"no policy apparatus\" and fixating on political calculation, and was quoted as saying \"it's the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis,\" a comment he then explained in a 3,000-word, on-the-record memo to Suskind about his time in the administration. DiIulio later attempted to recant some of his characterizations.\nAn October 2004 cover story by Suskind in the New York Times Magazine stated that the president was planning to partially privatize Social Security as his first initiative if re-elected\u2014a disclosure that prompted controversy in the final two weeks of the campaign.[citation needed] In the article, Suskind quoted an unnamed advisor to Bush (later identified as someone who \"seems to have been\" Rove)[11][12] as saying that\n\nguys like me were 'in what we call the reality-based community,' which he defined as people who 'believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.' I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. 'That's not the way the world really works anymore,' he continued. 'We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality\u2014 judiciously, as you will\u2014we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors ... and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.'[13]\nBooks[edit]\nA Hope in the Unseen[edit]\nMain article: A Hope in the Unseen\nIn 1995 Suskind wrote a series of articles on the struggles of inner-city honors students in Washington, D.C, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. Parts of these articles were used in his first book, A Hope in the Unseen (Doubleday/Broadway, 1998). The story chronicles the two-year journey of Cedric L. Jennings, an honor student who aspires to escape his blighted D.C. upbringing by going to an Ivy League university.\nThe book was chosen by The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington Monthly and Booklist as one of the best books of the year.[14] The New York Times Book Review called it an \"extraordinary, formula-shattering book\". David Halberstam called it a \"beautiful book of a heroic American struggle.\"[15] The book has been a selection in college courses on American culture, education, sociology and creative writing, and has been a required reading for incoming freshmen at some universities.[citation needed] In 2008, the book was selected as part of the \"One Maryland, One Book\" program.[16]\nIn a review of the book, CNN declared: \"As more voters, politicos and talk-show hosts write off affirmative action as a well-intentioned anachronism, A Hope in the Unseen should be required reading for would-be opinion-mongers.\"[17] In his review for Newsday, Bill Reel stated \"I changed my thinking about affirmative action. I was against it, now I am for it. The agent of change was a mind-opening book\u2014A Hope in the Unseen by Ron Suskind.\"[18]\nThe book has been a favorite of Bill Clinton[19] and school reformer Michelle Rhee,[20] and Barack Obama.\nSuskind says his writing style for this book was to use exhaustive reporting to place readers inside the heads of characters. Suskind stated that this \"writing style\" was a delving into motive and intent in an effort to understand the \"good enough reasons\" that underlie actions, which allowed for a fuller, more accurate\u2014and often emotionally powerful\u2014rendering of characters. The Chicago Tribune called the book \"the new, new nonfiction.\"[21]\n\nThe Price of Loyalty[edit]\nMain article: The Price of Loyalty\nThe Price of Loyalty was published on January 13, 2004. The book, which chronicled the two-year tenure of United States Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, was about the conduct and character of the Bush presidency. While the book covered a number of foreign and domestic issues, it is focussed on events that culminated in the Iraq War.\nAmong the disclosures in the book, which drew from numerous sources and more than 19,000 internal government documents, one was that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the U.S. occupation of Iraq was planned from Bush's first U.S. National Security Council meeting in January 2001, soon after Bush took office.[22] This lay in contrast to the perception that concerns over Iraq came to the forefront after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Administration officials have contended that O'Neill confused contingency plans with actual plans for invasion.[23]\nRather than denying his allegations, Bush officials attacked O'Neill's credibility, while answering that regime change in Iraq had been official U.S. policy since 1998, three years before Bush took office. However, O'Neill's claims called into question the relationship of the Iraq occupation to the post-9/11 War on Terrorism. After the cover sheet of a packet containing classified information was shown during a 60 Minutes interview of O'Neill and Suskind, the United States Department of Treasury investigated whether both men had improperly received classified materials. It concluded in March 2004 that no laws were violated, but that inadequate document handling policies at the Treasury had allowed 140 documents which should have been marked classified to be entered into a computer system for unclassified documents. The documents were among those subsequently released to O'Neill in response to a legal document request and then given to Suskind.[24]\nIn domestic affairs, the statements by O'Neill about the administration's allegedly chaotic and politically driven policy-making process supported the claims of John DiIulio. O'Neill stated that Vice President Cheney had become part of \"a co-presidency\" with George W. Bush. One of the book's disclosures involved the conflict between O'Neill and Cheney over what would become the 2003 tax cut. O'Neill, in a November 2002 meeting with Cheney and other senior officials, said that it was unprecedented to cut taxes at a time of war and that the cuts\u2014which included the wealthiest Americans\u2014would eventually push the government toward \"fiscal crisis.\" Cheney's response was, \"Reagan proved deficits don't matter. We won the midterms. This is our due.\" O'Neill opposed this policy.\n\nThe One Percent Doctrine[edit]\nMain article: The One Percent Doctrine\nThe One Percent Doctrine is Suskind's third book, published in 2006. The book is about the evolution of the foreign policy of the younger Bush's administration especially in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Excerpts of book were published in the June 18, 2006, issue of Time. Based on interviews with more than a hundred sources, including several cabinet officials, the book concluded that U.S. foreign policy since 9/11 was driven by the Bush Doctrine, which is described by a quote from Vice President Dick Cheney saying that it was important for the U.S. to think of \"low probability, high impact events\"\u2014like terrorists or rogue states getting their hands on WMD\u2014\"in a new way.\"\n\nIf there's a 1% chance that Pakistani scientists are helping al-Qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon, we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response. It's not about our analysis. ... It's about our response.\nThe doctrine, Suskind asserts, freed the administration from the dictates of evidence and allowed suspicion to be a guide for action in both its battles against terrorists and against rogue states, like Iraq under Saddam Hussein.\nOne of Suskind's assertions\u2014that a suspect in the London subway bombings was on a US \"no fly\" list and attempted to enter the US\u2014has been challenged by the US government. The FBI described Suskind's reporting on this single matter as \"inaccurate\", and issued a statement saying \"the author has intertwined facts ... causing some confusion.\"[25]\nDespite being vetted by the CIA prior to publication, the book contained enough information to identify Aimen Dean, a mole within al Qaeda who had spent seven and a half years working for MI6 and had proven one of their most valuable assets. He was forced to quit his role & go into hiding, after extremists issued a Fatwa calling for his death.[26]\nThe book was a New York Times Bestseller. Frank Rich called it a \"must-read bestseller\" while Michael Hill stated: \"If Bob Woodward is the chronicler of the Bush administration, Ron Suskind is the analyst ... Historians will be grateful for it as they write the many final drafts in the decades to come.\"\n\nThe Way of the World[edit]\nMain article: The Way of the World: A Story of Truth and Hope in an Age of Extremism\nThe Way of the World: A Story of Truth and Hope in an Age of Extremism was published on August 5, 2008. The book tells of people engaged in the challenges of national security and cultural connection. Among these stories are the tales of an intelligence official working to combat nuclear terrorism, a detainee lawyer fighting for rights at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, a young Pakistani man interrogated under the White House, an Afghan teenager who spends a year in American high school, and former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto as she returns to Pakistan to challenge President Pervez Musharraf.[27]\nIn his assessment for the Literary Review, Michael Burleigh said:  \"Using a series of interwoven stories, some hopeful, others disturbing, Suskind explores whether the United States and the Muslim world will ever be able to find mutual respect and understanding. ... This is a hugely important field that has never been so well examined.\"[28] The Sunday Times declared \"Suskind is never unsympathetic to his characters, who he appears to have debriefed intensively. He is a romantic, a writer who clearly believes that his country has betrayed its past, its values and its moral compass by failing to tell the truth about the war.\" The New York Observer said: \"Moving. ... Mr. Suskind is a prodigiously talented craftsman. ... It's all here: a cast of characters that sprawls across class and circumstance to represent the totality of a historical moment. ... These hard times, Mr. Suskind's book suggests, call for a nonfiction Dickens.\"[29]\nMark Danner, reviewing the book for The New York Times, writes that \"these narratives and others perform, in Mr. Suskind's hands, an intricate arabesque and manage, to a rather remarkable degree, to show us, in this age of terror, 'the true way of the world.'\"[30] It is around the stories of these characters that the book frames the debate about how America lost much of its moral authority in recent years and how it is struggling, often through the actions and initiative of individuals, to restore it.[31]\nThe Way of the World made a series of disclosures centered on Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, the head of Iraqi intelligence under Saddam Hussein. The book said that British and American intelligence entered into a dialogue with Habbush before the invasion of Iraq, in which Habbush revealed that Saddam possessed no weapons of mass destruction and did not take an American invasion seriously. The book also contends that the Central Intelligence Agency resettled Habbush, paid him $5 million, and forged a document in his name alleging that 9/11 hijacker Mohammad Atta trained in Iraq.[32]\nThe White House, former CIA director George Tenet, and former CIA officer Robert Richer, a figure in the book, denied involvement in the illegal act of fabricating the Habbush letter, denials that were echoed in an official CIA statement, saying of Suskind's claim that the White House ordered the agency to forge a letter from Habbush: \"It did not happen.\"[33]\nSuskind responded to the Rob Richer's denial, circulated by the White House, by posting on his website a partial transcript of a taped conversation with Richer in which the two discuss the Habbush forgery.[34] In response to the official CIA statement, Suskind told The Washington Post that the disclosures and details in his book are backed up by hours of interviews and that there is \"not a shred of doubt about any of it.\"[35] On August 11, House Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers announced that his committee would look into the matter of the Habbush letter and a variety of other disclosures in the book.[36]\nThe Way of the World debuted at number 3 on The New York Times Best Seller list,[37] but some remarked that its revelations did not produce the outrage or scandal that would seem to attend a White House-run disinformation campaign aimed at U.S. public opinion.[38] The layers of the controversy have nonetheless deepened with the revelation that Ayad Allawi, the initial source of the Habbush letter, was at CIA headquarters the week before the letter emerged,[39] and a piece in The American Conservative by Philip Giraldi that claims an \"extremely reliable and well placed source in the intelligence community\" confirmed that the Vice President's Office was behind the Habbush letter, but that \"Doug Feith's Office of Special Plans\", not the CIA, carried out the forgery.[40]\nSome disclosures in The Way of the World received less attention than the Habbush controversy, but the story the book tells about Pervez Musharraf's actions toward Benazir Bhutto during the last months of her life was picked up in the Pakistani press and dovetailed with a movement calling for the impeachment of the (now former) Pakistani president.[41] Speaking to another aspect of the book, Mark Danner, in his review for The New York Times, writes that \"the revelation of an effort to steal and sell fissile material in Georgia's now celebrated 'breakaway region' of South Ossetia ... is only the most terrifying of a dozen or more newsworthy disclosures in this book.\"[42] Suskind cites the battle against nuclear terrorism as the most pressing crisis the United States needs to combat in order to restore its moral authority, and details an ambitious attempt to infiltrate the worldwide nuclear black market, called the \"Armageddon Test.\"[43]\n\nConfidence Men[edit]\nMain article: Confidence Men\nConfidence Men: Wall Street, Washington and the Education of a President was published on September 20, 2011, by HarperCollins. It describes the financial crisis that began in the U.S. in 2008, and the attempts by President Barack Obama's White House to combat it.\nOn September 15, 2011, news of the book began to leak to the press. The New York Times, having obtained an advanced copy, wrote: \"The book offers a portrait of a White House operating under intense pressure as it dealt with a cascade of crises, from insolvent banks to collapsing carmakers. And it details the rivalries among figures around the president, including Mr. Summers; Mr. Geithner; the former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel; and the budget director, Peter R. Orszag.[44]\nAn article in The Washington Post on September 16 elaborated on the content of the book, citing the allegation that Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner ignored a directive from the president to draw up plans for restructuring Citibank in the spring of 2009. The article also notes that in an interview in the book, Geithner denies the account saying \"I don't slow-walk the president on anything\". The White House pushed back against the book in spite of having granted Ron Suskind an interview with the president. Communications director Dan Pfeiffer said that books like these \"tend to take the normal day-to-day activities of governing and infuse them with drama, palace intrigue and salacious details\".[45]\nWhile some faulted Suskind for giving greater credence to the views of sources who gave him more journalistic access others praised him for doing the opposite. In his review for The New York Times Book Review, Joe Nocera wrote \"to his everlasting credit, Suskind savages several people he clearly spent time interviewing, starting with Obama's former chief economic adviser, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner, his Treasury secretary. And he's more than willing to step outside his re-created scenes to conduct interviews, in which Obama aides and allies tell truths that are genuinely painful to hear.\"[46]\nIn his first television appearance, on the Today Show, Suskind was interviewed by anchor Ann Curry, who cited the White House pushback in her questioning. Suskind maintained that the book represented an accurate depiction of what he had found in his reporting.[47] Hendrik Hertzberg wrote in his review of the book for The New Yorker that it would offer \"support for some of today's standard progressive gripes about the President\" being stymied by his conservative, Wall Street-attentive advisers, \"and for a few of the conservative ones,\" namely assertions that Obama arrived in office unprepared to lead.[48] In his review of the book for The New York Times, Joe Nocera noted that the book had \"an omniscient quality\" of fly-on-the-wall scenes from inside the White House, much like the books of Bob Woodward, but \"doesn't really go for phony omniscience\" where the sources who are most cooperative are rendered most favorably. In a New Republic review, John B. Judis wrote, \"Suskind's book is being widely portrayed as critical of the Obama administration, but if you read the entire book, its message is that during Obama's first two years he was foiled by his own inexperience as a manager and by a staff that didn't do good by him, but that after the Democratic defeat in 2010 he learned from his failure.\"[49]\nBoth Summers and Geithner, who responded to disclosures in the book's pages, pushed back against their characterizations after publication.[45]\nA week after publication, the book debuted at No. 2 on The New York Times Best Seller list for Nonfiction.[50]\nAccording to the book President Obama supported a financial transaction tax on trades of stocks, derivatives, and other financial instruments, but he was blocked by Summers.[51]\nConfidence Men was cited on various \"best book\" lists, and named an Esquire 2011 Best Book of the Year, with David Granger commenting: \"Journalism like this is all too rare.\"[52] In the March 2012 issue of The Atlantic, James Fallows cited Confidence Men in his article \"Obama, Explained,\" writing that the Obama administration's \"early failure of accountability\" in its \"apparent coddling of Wall Street in 2009 ... is the main theme of Ron Suskind's Confidence Men ... it created a substantive and symbolic problem the administration has never fully recovered from. Substantive, because of the moral hazard created by using public money to guarantee the bonuses and repay the losses of people who had been so recklessly destructive. Symbolic, for all the reasons that eventually came to a head with last year's Occupy movement. An official familiar with the administration's economic policy told me: 'The recapitalization of the banks was a good idea, and necessary. But we did not put enough conditions on [their] getting the money. Ultimately not being tougher with the guys that got the money is the thing that overthrows the government twice\u2014in 2008 [in a reaction against Bush's TARP plan] and again in 2010.'\"[53]\n\nLife, Animated[edit]\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (May 2014)\nLife, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism was published on April 1, 2014, by Kingswell (an imprint of Disney Publishing Worldwide). It is the number 1 best seller under the category of \"Special Needs Biographies\" on Amazon,[54][non-primary source needed] and also made The New York Times Best Seller list under Science Books.[55][not specific enough to verify] The memoir describes the Suskind family's two-decade journey in connecting with their youngest son Owen, who was diagnosed at age 3 with regressive autism, lost his ability to speak, and then developed an obsessive interest in Disney movies. Once the family discovered this, they began to play the roles of animated characters and conversing in Disney dialogue \u2013 a method that over years helped their son regain speech. Suskind chose to publish the book through a Disney imprint because of his son's frequent quotation of Disney movies in the book; otherwise, he would have had to pay licensing fees for each line of dialogue used.[citation needed] However, Disney agreed to exert no influence over any of the contents of the book.[56] In the memoir, Suskind explains how the family and therapists helped Owen use the Disney stories to relate to real situations, develop \"inner speech\" capacities, and gradually connect to others.[57] He calls this intense interest in Disney an example of an autism \"affinity,\" referring to the propensity for individuals with autism to develop sustained, self-directed passions in one or a few subject areas. The Suskinds found that these deep interests \u2013 long viewed as unproductive obsessions that should be\ncurtailed \u2013 are more \"pathway than prison\" for individuals with autism or other untraditional learners, insofar they use them \"like an enigma machine to crack the codes of the wider world and find their way forward.\"[58][59]\nThe New York Times book review of Life, Animated wrote that Suskind \"charts Owen's remarkable journey back to connection through the unlikely vehicle of the Disney cartoons that are his only passion.\"[60] USA Today called Owen \"every reader's son,\" writing that \"For Owen and his family, Disney evolved into his translator of reality. He memorized every line of dialogue in the films and learned, in his own way, how to re-enact each scene, fully loaded with the emotions and the moral lessons embedded in them. And his family, despite the misgivings of their doctors, learned to connect with Owen through Disney as well.\"[61] The St. Louis Post-Dispatch called it a \"wonderful book, whether or not you know a person with autism,\" and asserted that, \"without delving into too much statistical and informational overload, Suskind explains in a straightforward way many of the differences in how people with autism perceive and process information.\"[62] A chapter that was excerpted in the March 9th issue of the New York Times Magazine became the most emailed piece of the month.[63]\nSuskind describes the positive response as a \"giant warm wave\" that differentiates\nthis \"personal\" narrative from his others.[64] He has since spoken to audiences at the United Nations and the NIH; testified in front of the United States Congress; and appeared on numerous TV and radio shows, including ABC's Good Morning America, NBC's Nightly News with Brian Williams, CBS's Sunday Morning, NPR and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.[65]\nOn April 2, 2014, for World Autism Awareness Day, Ron spoke to the UN about his family's experience, stressing the need for government-funded research and support around the world.[66] On April 7, The New York Times reported the methodology the family created, which they called \"Affinity Therapy,\" will be studied by researchers from MIT, Yale, and Cambridge University to try to\nunderstand the neural mechanisms at work and develop a manualized, therapeutic model harnessing affinities for those with autism.[67]\nOn October 17, 2014, in a feature column for The New York Times about her own autistic son's relationship with Siri, Apple's personal assistant software for iPhone, Judith Newman stated that Suskind \"is talking to SRI (Stanford Research Institute) about having assistants for those with autism that can be programmed to speak in the voice of the character that reaches them.\"[68]\n\nFilms[edit]\nLife, Animated[edit]\nA&E Indie Films announced in August 2014 that it was producing a documentary, directed by Academy Award-winning director Roger Ross Williams, on Owen and the Suskinds' story.[69]\nThe documentary, Life, Animated, based on Suskind's book of the same name, was co-produced by Williams with Julie Goldman, Carolyn Hepburn and Christopher Clements. Suskind was executive producer of the film.\nThe film won two Emmy awards, and was nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary feature.[70]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d \"Cornelia A.

    "wiki": "American author and columnist (born 1979)\n\n\nRoss DouthatBornRoss Gregory Douthat (1979-11-28) November 28, 1979 (age\u00a044)San Francisco, California, U.S.OccupationColumnistauthorbloggerEducationHarvard University (BA)SubjectsPoliticsreligionsocial commentaryhigher educationSpouse\nAbigail Tucker \u200b(m.\u00a02007)\u200b\nRoss Gregory Douthat[a] (born November 28, 1979) is an American political analyst, blogger, author and New York Times columnist.[2] He was a senior editor of The Atlantic. He has written on a variety of topics, including the state of Christianity in America and \"sustainable decadence\" in contemporary society.\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nRoss Gregory Douthat was born in 1979 in San Francisco, California, and grew up in New Haven, Connecticut.[3] As an adolescent, Douthat converted to Pentecostalism and then, with the rest of his family,[4] to Catholicism.[5]\nHis mother is a writer.[6] His great-grandfather was the poet and Governor Charles Wilbert Snow of Connecticut.[7] His father, Charles Douthat, is a partner in a New Haven law firm[8][9] and a poet. In 2007, Douthat married Abigail Tucker, a reporter for The Baltimore Sun and a writer for Smithsonian.[8] He and his family live in New Haven, Connecticut.[10]\nDouthat has written that he suffers from chronic Lyme disease, a diagnosis that is unrecognized by mainstream medicine. His symptoms began in 2015, soon after he and his family had moved to Connecticut. This is the subject of his book The Deep Places.[11][12]\n\nEducation[edit]\nDouthat attended Hamden Hall, a private high school in Hamden, Connecticut. Douthat graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard University in 2002, where he was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa. While there he contributed to The Harvard Crimson and edited The Harvard Salient.[13]\n\nCareer[edit]\nDouthat is a regular columnist for The New York Times.[14] In April 2009, he became the youngest regular op-ed writer in The New York Times after replacing Bill Kristol as a conservative voice on the Times editorial page.[15][16]\nBefore joining The New York Times, he was a senior editor at The Atlantic.[17] He has published books on the decline of religion in American society, the role of Harvard University in creating an American ruling class and other topics related to religion, politics and society. His book Grand New Party (2008), which he co-wrote with Reihan Salam, was described by New York Times commentator David Brooks as the \"best single roadmap of where the Republican Party should and is likely to head.\"[18] Douthat's The Decadent Society: How We Became the Victims of Our Own Success (2020) received positive reviews in The New York Times[19] and National Review.[20] Douthat frequently appeared on the video debate site Bloggingheads.tv until 2012.\nDouthat has written in support of banning abortion, arguing that science shows that a zygote (a fertilized egg) is a distinct human and that destroying it would be to kill a human.[21]\n\nPublished works[edit]\nPrivilege: Harvard and the Education of the Ruling Class.

In August 2017, she began hosting S.E. Cupp: Unfiltered, a political panel show, co-hosted by Andrew Levy, on HLN and later CNN.\nShe is a former panelist on the CNN political debate show Crossfire, author of Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity and co-author of Why You're Wrong About the Right. She was a panelist on Real News on TheBlaze, a co-host of the MSNBC talk show The Cycle, and a frequent guest host on the Fox News late night talk show Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. She is a frequent guest panelist on Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nCupp was born in Oceanside, California.[1][2] While growing up, she lived in Andover, Massachusetts, and attended the Academy of Notre Dame.[3] From age six until her late teens, she studied ballet.[4] While attending ballet school, she suffered from eating disorders and experienced a relapse during her college years.[5] In 2000, Cupp graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in art history. While attending Cornell, she worked for The Cornell Daily Sun. In 2010, she earned a Master of Arts degree from the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at New York University with a concentration in religious studies.[6]\n\nMedia career[edit]\nAfter graduating from Cornell, Cupp worked for an online magazine and a public relations company.[citation needed] She was also a contributor to Politico.com's The Arena and has been a frequent guest on all three major cable news channels \u2013 CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.\nHer writings have appeared in several publications, including The Washington Post, New York Daily News, The American Spectator, Townhall, Newsmax, Human Events, Slate, Maxim, and The Daily Caller.[7]\nIn 2009, Cupp was hired as a columnist at the New York Daily News. In 2011, she was hired as a writer and commentator for Mercury Radio Arts,[8] the organization owned and operated by Glenn Beck. Shortly after being hired by Beck, Cupp was given her show, S.E. Cupp, on the Insider Extreme broadcast on Glennbeck.com.[9] The show was moved to GBTV (now TheBlaze TV).\nOn June 25, 2012, she began co-hosting The Cycle on MSNBC with political strategist Krystal Ball, pop-culture commentator Tour\u00e9, and senior Salon political writer Steve Kornacki.[10]\nAfter living and working in New York City for over a decade, Cupp moved to Washington, D.C., in 2013, after CNN hired her to join the panel of a new version of Crossfire, with panelists Newt Gingrich, Stephanie Cutter, and Van Jones.[11][12][timeframe?] Consequently, Cupp left MSNBC and The Cycle, following her final appearance on June 27, 2013.[13]\nOn March 13, 2017, CNN's sister network, HLN, announced that Cupp would host a new evening program, S.E. Cupp Unfiltered, in June.[14] In August 2018, the program moved to CNN as a weekly program on Saturday evenings.[15]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nThroughout her career, Cupp has described herself as a \"mainstream conservative\" and a supporter of \"limited government, self-reliance, self-empowerment, lower taxes\".[16][17]\nAlthough an atheist herself, on July 5, 2012, Cupp said on The Cycle that she \"would never vote for an atheist president\". When asked to explain, Cupp said she felt that a president must not represent only 10 to 15 percent of the American populace and that faith served as a \"check\" on presidential power.[18][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nIn March 2013, Cupp pulled out of a CPAC appearance because of its stances on homosexuality and gay marriage, saying she \"became increasingly uncomfortable [aligning] with an event, a great event in many ways, that had nonetheless attempted to marginalize a significant group of conservatives working on our behalf.\"[19] She has since joined Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry.[20] She has said that Republicans should be \"natural allies\" for same-sex marriage.[21]\nDuring Ron Paul's 2012 presidential campaign, Cupp criticized his non-interventionist foreign policy, saying the United States has an obligation to \"[fight] brutal regimes and human rights abuses around the world\".[16]\nCupp was strongly critical of Donald Trump's presidency, saying \"I don't know these Republicans [that support Trump]. This isn't what drew me to this party.\"[17] She voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election.[22][23]\nCupp personally opposes abortion, but believes it should be legal and opposed the overturning of Roe v. Wade.[24]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nSince 1995, Cupp has been an atheist, but has consistently stated that she is open to theism,[25][26][27] and once said in an interview with C-SPAN, \"I really aspire to be a person of faith some day.\"[28]\nCupp met John Goodwin, a former chief of staff to Representative Ra\u00fal Labrador, at the 2008 Republican Convention, and they began dating in 2011.[29] They married in November 2013, and have one son.[30][31] In 2017, Goodwin became head of communications for The Weather Channel, and that year, the family moved from Washington, D.C., to Darien, Connecticut.[11][32]\n\nWorks[edit]\nCupp, S.

His work touches on a range of topics, including rationality, religion, ethics, free will, neuroscience, meditation, psychedelics, philosophy of mind, politics, terrorism, and artificial intelligence. Harris came to prominence for his criticism of religion, and is known as one of the \"Four Horsemen\" of New Atheism, along with Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and Daniel Dennett.[2][3][4]\nHarris's first book, The End of Faith (2004), won the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for First Nonfiction and remained on The New York Times Best Seller list for 33 weeks. Harris has since written six additional books: Letter to a Christian Nation in 2006, The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values in 2010, the long-form essay Lying in 2011, the short book Free Will in 2012, Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion in 2014, and (with British writer Maajid Nawaz) Islam and the Future of Tolerance: A Dialogue in 2015. Harris's work has been translated into over 20 languages. Some critics have argued that Harris's writings are Islamophobic.[5] Harris and his supporters, however, reject this characterization,[6] adding that such a labeling is an attempt to silence criticism.[7]\nHarris has debated with many prominent figures on the topics of God or religion, including William Lane Craig, Jordan Peterson, Rick Warren, Robert Wright, Andrew Sullivan, Cenk Uygur, Reza Aslan, David Wolpe, Deepak Chopra, Ben Shapiro, and Jean Houston. Since September 2013, Harris has hosted the Making Sense podcast (originally titled Waking Up), which has a large listenership. In September 2018, Harris released a meditation app, Waking Up with Sam Harris.[a] He was one of the original core members of the so-called \"intellectual dark web\",[8] although Harris has stated that he does not identify as a part of that group.[9][10]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nSamuel Benjamin Harris was born in Los Angeles, California, on April 9, 1967.[11][12] He is the son of the late actor Berkeley Harris, who appeared mainly in Western films, and TV writer and producer Susan Harris (n\u00e9e Spivak), who created Soap and The Golden Girls, among other series.[13][14] His father, born in North Carolina, came from a Quaker background, and his mother is Jewish but not religious.[15] He was raised by his mother following his parents' divorce when he was age two.[16] Harris has stated that his upbringing was entirely secular and that his parents rarely discussed religion, though he also stated that he was not raised as an atheist.[17]\nWhile his original major was in English, Harris became interested in philosophical questions while at Stanford University after an experience with MDMA.[18][19][20] The experience interested him in the idea he might be able to achieve spiritual insights without the use of drugs.[21] Leaving Stanford in his second year, a quarter after his psychoactive experience, he visited India and Nepal, where he studied meditation with teachers of Buddhist and Hindu religions,[21][22] including Dilgo Khyentse.[23] For a few weeks in the early 1990s, he was a volunteer guard in the security detail of the Dalai Lama.[24][25]\nIn 1997, after eleven years overseas, Harris returned to Stanford, completing a B.A. degree in philosophy in 2000.[26][27][28] Harris began writing his first book, The End of Faith, immediately after the September 11 attacks.[26]\nHe received a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience in 2009 from the University of California, Los Angeles,[26][29][30] using functional magnetic resonance imaging to conduct research into the neural basis of belief, disbelief, and uncertainty.[26][30] His thesis was titled The Moral Landscape: How Science Could Determine Human Values. His advisor was Mark S. Cohen.[31]\n\nCareer[edit]\nWriting[edit]\nHarris's writing concerns philosophy, neuroscience, and criticism of religion. He came to prominence for his criticism of religion (Islam in particular) and he is described as one of the Four Horsemen of Atheism, along with Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and Daniel Dennett.[32][2] He has written for publications such as The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Economist, London Times, The Boston Globe, and The Atlantic.[33] Five of Harris's books have been New York Times bestsellers, and his writing has been translated into over 20 languages.[33] The End of Faith (2004) remained on The New York Times Best Seller list for 33 weeks.[34]\nHarris has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss's 2016 self-help book Tools of Titans.\n\nDebates on religion[edit]\nIn September 2006 Harris debated Robert Wright on the rationality of religious belief.[35] In 2007, he engaged in a lengthy debate with conservative commentator Andrew Sullivan on the Internet forum Beliefnet.[36] In April 2007, Harris debated with evangelical pastor Rick Warren for Newsweek magazine.[37] Harris debated with Rabbi David Wolpe in 2007.[38] In 2010, Harris joined Michael Shermer to debate with Deepak Chopra and Jean Houston on the future of God in a debate hosted by ABC News Nightline.[39] Harris debated with Christian philosopher William Lane Craig in April 2011 on whether there can be an objective morality without God.[40] In June and July 2018, he met with Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson for a series of debates on religion, particularly the relationship between religious values and scientific fact in defining truth.[41][42] Harris has debated with the scholar Reza Aslan.[43]\n\nPodcast[edit]\nIn September 2013, Harris began releasing the Waking Up podcast (since re-titled Making Sense). Episodes vary in length but often last over two hours.[44] Releases do not follow a regular schedule.[45]\nThe podcast focuses on a wide array of topics related to science and spirituality, including philosophy, religion, morality, free will, neuroscience, meditation, psychedelics and artificial intelligence. Harris has interviewed a wide range of guests, including scientists, philosophers, spiritual teachers, and authors. Guests have included Jordan Peterson, Dan Dennett, Janna Levin, Sharon Salzberg, and David Chalmers.[45][46][13][47]\n\nMeditation app[edit]\nIn September 2018, Harris released a meditation course app, Waking Up with Sam Harris. The app provides daily meditations; long guided meditations; daily \"Moments\" (brief meditations and reminders); conversations with thought leaders in psychology, meditation, philosophy, psychedelics, and other disciplines; a selection of lessons on various topics, such as Mind & Emotion, Free Will, and Doing Good; and more. Users of the app are introduced to several types of meditation, such as mindfulness meditation, vipassan\u0101-style meditation, loving-kindness meditation, and Dzogchen.[48]\nIn September 2020, Harris announced his commitment to donate at least 10% of Waking Up's profits to highly effective charities,[49] thus becoming the first company to sign the Giving What We Can pledge for companies.[50] The pledge was retroactive, taking into account the profits since the day the app launched 2 years previously.[49]\n\nViews[edit]\nReligion[edit]\nPart of a series onAtheism\nConcepts\nImplicit and explicit atheism\nNaturalism\nNegative and positive atheism\n\nHistory\nHistory of atheism\nAtheism during the Age of Enlightenment\nNew Atheism\n\nSociety\nAtheist feminism\nCriticism of religion\nDemographics of atheism\nDiscrimination against atheists\nSecular ethics\nSecularism\nSeparation of church and state\nState atheism\n\nArgumentsArguments for atheism\n\nAtheist's wager\nCreator of God\nEvil God challenge\nFate of the unlearned\nFree will\nGod of the gaps\nHitchens's razor\nIncompatible properties\nInconsistent revelation\nNonbelief\nOccam's razor\nOmnipotence paradox\nParody religion\nPoor design\nProblem of evil\nProblem of Hell\nRussell's teapot\nTheological noncognitivism\n\n\nPeople\nLists of atheists\nJulian Baggini\nMikhail Bakunin\nMario Bunge\nAlbert Camus\nRichard Dawkins\nDaniel Dennett\nDenis Diderot\nLudwig Feuerbach\nA.

Harris is particularly opposed to what he refers to as dogmatic belief, and says that \"Pretending to know things one doesn't know is a betrayal of science \u2013 and yet it is the lifeblood of religion.\"[51] While purportedly opposed to religion in general and the belief systems of them, Harris believes that all religions are not created equal.[52] Often invoking Jainism to contrast Islam as a whole, Harris highlights the difference in the specific doctrine and scripture as the main indicator of a religion's value, or lack thereof.[53][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nIn 2006, Harris described Islam as \"all fringe and no center\",[54] and wrote in The End of Faith that \"the doctrine of Islam [...] represents a unique danger to all of us\", arguing that the war on terror is really a war against Islam.[55] In 2014, Harris said he considers Islam to be \"especially belligerent and inimical to the norms of civil discourse\", as it involves what Harris considers to be \"bad ideas, held for bad reasons, leading to bad behavior.\"[53] In 2015 Harris and secular Islamic activist Maajid Nawaz cowrote Islam and the Future of Tolerance.[56] In this book, Harris argues that the word Islamophobia is a \"pernicious meme\", a label which prevents discussion about the threat of Islam.[55] Harris has been described in 2020 by Jonathan Matusitz, Associate Professor at the University of Central Florida, as \"a champion of the counter-jihad left\".[57]\nHarris is critical of the Christian right in politics in the United States, blaming them for the political focus on \"pseudo-problems like gay marriage\".[58] He is also critical of liberal Christianity\u00a0\u2013 as represented, for instance, by the theology of Paul Tillich\u00a0\u2013 which he argues claims to base its beliefs on the Bible despite actually being influenced by secular modernity. He further states that in so doing liberal Christianity provides rhetorical cover to fundamentalists.[58]\n\nSpirituality[edit]\nHarris holds that there is \"nothing irrational about seeking the states of mind that lie at the core of many religions. Compassion, awe, devotion, and feelings of oneness are surely among the most valuable experiences a person can have.\"[21]\n\nEverything of value that people get from religion can be had more honestly, without presuming anything on insufficient evidence. The rest is self-deception, set to music.\u2014\u200aSam Harris, [59]\nHarris rejects the dichotomy between spirituality and rationality, favoring a middle path that preserves spirituality and science but does not involve religion.[60] He writes that spirituality should be understood in light of scientific disciplines like neuroscience and psychology.[60] Science, he contends, can show how to maximize human well-being, but may fail to answer certain questions about the nature of being, answers to some of which he says are discoverable directly through our experience.[60] His conception of spirituality does not involve a belief in any god.[61]\nIn Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion (2014), Harris describes his experience with Dzogchen, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice, and recommends it to his readers.[60] He writes that the purpose of spirituality (as he defines it \u2013 he concedes that the term's uses are diverse and sometimes indefensible) is to become aware that our sense of self is illusory, and says this realization brings both happiness and insight into the nature of consciousness, mirroring core Buddhist beliefs.[60][62] This process of realization, he argues, is based on experience and is not contingent on faith.[60] Harris especially recommends the \"headless\" meditation technique as written about by Douglas Harding.[citation needed]\n\nScience and morality[edit]\nIn The Moral Landscape, Harris argues that science can answer moral problems and aid human well-being.[63]\n\nFree will[edit]\nSee also: Neuroscience of free will\nHarris says that the idea of free will \"cannot be mapped on to any conceivable reality\" and is incoherent.[1] Harris writes in Free Will that neuroscience \"reveals you to be a biochemical puppet.\"[64]\nPhilosopher Daniel Dennett argued that Harris's book Free Will successfully refuted the common understanding of free will, but that he failed to respond adequately to the compatibilist understanding of free will. Dennett said the book was valuable because it expressed the views of many eminent scientists, but that it nonetheless contained a \"veritable museum of mistakes\" and that \"Harris and others need to do their homework if they want to engage with the best thought on the topic.\"[65]\n\nArtificial intelligence[edit]\nHarris is a frequent critic of Artificial intelligence.[66][67] He has discussed existential risk from artificial general intelligence in depth.[68] He has given a TED talk on the topic, arguing it will be a major threat in the future and criticizing the paucity of human interest on the subject.[69] He argues the dangers from artificial intelligence (AI) follow from three premises: that intelligence is the result of physical information processing, that humans will continue innovation in AI, and that humans are nowhere near the maximum possible extent of intelligence.[69] Harris states that even if superintelligent AI is five to ten decades away, the scale of its implications for human civilization warrants discussion of the issue in the present.[69]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nHarris describes himself as a liberal, is a registered Democrat[70] and has never voted Republican in presidential elections.[45] He supports same-sex marriage and decriminalizing drugs.[71] In an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times, Harris said that he supported most of the criticism against the Bush administration's war in Iraq, and all criticism of fiscal policy and the administration's treatment of science. Harris also said that liberalism has grown \"dangerously out of touch with the realities of our world\" regarding threats allegedly posed by Islamic fundamentalism.[71]\n\nIsrael[edit]\nHarris opposes Biblical or religious claims to Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state and Jewish claims of ownership made in the Bible. Rather, Harris has said due to the hostility towards Jews, he has conceded that if there is one religious group which needs protections in the form of a state, it is Jews and the State of Israel.[72][73]\nWith regard to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, he has criticized both Israel and Palestine for committing war crimes. He has indicated that he believes that Israel genuinely wants peace and that its neighbors are more devoted to the destruction of Israel.[74] Harris has also said that Palestine is more guilty, citing Hamas' use of human shields and genocidal rhetoric towards the Jews as reasons Palestine is more morally culpable.[72] He names these as reasons that Israel has a right to defend itself against Palestine.[74]\nDuring the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war, Harris supported Israel and rejected arguments that Israel provoked Hamas by building Israeli settlements in the West Bank citing the fact that Gaza had not been occupied since 2005. He also condemned the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, which led to the war.[75]\n\nPresidential elections[edit]\nIn the 2008 United States presidential election, he supported the candidacy of Barack Obama and opposed Republican John McCain's candidacy.[76][77] During the 2016 United States presidential election, Harris supported Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Party presidential primaries against Bernie Sanders,[78] and despite calling her \"a terribly flawed candidate for the presidency\", he favored her in the general election and came out strongly in opposition to Donald Trump's candidacy.[79][46] Harris has criticized Trump for lying, stating in 2018 that Trump \"has assaulted truth more than anyone in human history.\"[46]\nIn the 2020 United States presidential election, Harris supported Andrew Yang in the Democratic primaries.[80] Harris also introduced Yang to podcaster Joe Rogan.[81] After the 2020 election, he said that he did not care what was on Hunter Biden's laptop, telling the Triggernometry podcast that \"Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses of children in his basement\u00a0\u2013 I would not have cared\",[82][83] arguing more broadly that both Trump and Biden had been in the public eye for decades, and that Biden would have had to have engaged in an extraordinarily large scale of mendacity to come even close to the level of scandal Trump is known to have engaged in. He went on to say that nothing on the laptop would come close to even the \"Trump University\" scandal. He also said that Twitter's brief censoring of the laptop story on its platform was a \"conspiracy\" but that it was warranted. He has, however, since clarified that the word \"warranted\" was out of place, but that the decision could nevertheless be justifiable, since the story could have influenced the election at a time when it was not yet known if the story was true.[84][85]\n\nEconomics[edit]\nHarris supports raising taxes on the wealthy and reducing government spending, and has criticized billionaires like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett for paying relatively little in tax. He has proposed taxing 10% for estates worth above 10 million, taxing 50% for estates worth over a billion dollars, and then using the money to fund an infrastructure bank.[86]\nHe has accused conservatives of perceiving raising taxes as a form of theft or punishment, and of believing that by being rich they create value for others.[87][86] He has regarded this view as ludicrous, saying that \"markets aren't perfectly reflective of the value of goods and services, and many wealthy people don't create much in the way of value for others. In fact, as our recent financial crisis has shown, it is possible for a few people to become extraordinarily rich by wrecking the global economy\".[86]\n\nGun rights[edit]\nHarris owns guns and wrote in 2015 that he understood people's hostility towards gun culture in the United States and the political influence of the National Rifle Association of America. However, he argued that there is a rational case for gun ownership due to the fact that the police can not always be relied on and that guns are a good alternative.[88][89]\nHarris has stated that he disagrees with proposals by liberals and gun control advocates for restricting guns, such as the assault weapons ban, since more gun crimes are committed with handguns than the semi-automatic weapons which the ban would target. Harris has also said that the left-wing media gets many things wrong about guns. He has, however, offered support for certain regulations on gun ownership, such as mandatory training, licensure, and background checks before a gun can be legally purchased.[89]\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic[edit]\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, he criticized commentators for pushing views on COVID-19 that he considered to be \"patently insane\". Harris accused these commentators of believing that COVID-19 policies were a way of implementing social control and to crackdown on people's freedom politically.[90] Harris has feuded with Bret Weinstein over his views on COVID-19.[91] In 2023, he said that if COVID-19 had killed more children, there would be no patience for vaccine skepticism.[92]\nIn March 2023, he hosted Matt Ridley and Alina Chan on his podcast to discuss the origins of COVID-19 and the potential that the COVID-19 virus was made in a lab.[93][94]\n\nIntellectual dark web[edit]\nHarris has been described, alongside others such as Joe Rogan, Bret Weinstein, and Jordan Peterson, as a member of the intellectual dark web, a group that opposes political correctness and identity politics.[95] New York Times book reviewer Bari Weiss described the group as \"a collection of iconoclastic thinkers, academic renegades and media personalities who are having a rolling conversation \u2013 on podcasts, YouTube and Twitter, and in sold-out auditoriums \u2013 that sound unlike anything else happening, at least publicly, in the culture right now.\"[46] In November 2020, Harris stated that he does not identify as a part of that group.[9][10] In 2021 Harris stated that he had \"turn[ed] in [his] imaginary membership card to this imaginary organization\".[96]\nIn 2023 during an interview with the Daily Beast, Harris explained that he had broken away from the intellectual dark web due to disagreements with Bret Weinstein, and Maajid Nawaz's obsession with COVID-19 conspiracy theories and criticism of COVID-19 policies. He also cited him becoming disenchanted with Dave Rubin for having been captured by his audience and said \u201cRubin became far more cynical than I would have thought possible. And it\u2019s very depressing. He was a friend, he\u2019s not a friend anymore\".[97]\n\nControversies[edit]\nThis article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section may compromise the article's neutrality. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. (November 2023)\nRace and IQ controversy[edit]\nIn April 2017, Harris hosted the social scientist Charles Murray on his podcast, discussing topics including the heritability of IQ and race and intelligence.[98] Harris stated the invitation was out of indignation at a violent protest against Murray at Middlebury College the month before and not out of particular interest in the material at hand.[98] The podcast episode garnered significant criticism, most notably from Vox[47][99] and Slate.[100] In the Vox article, scientists, including Eric Turkheimer, Kathryn Paige Harden, and Richard E. Nisbett, accused Harris of participating in \"pseudoscientific racialist speculation\" and peddling \"junk science\". Harris and Murray were defended by commentators Andrew Sullivan[101] and Kyle Smith.[102] Harris and Vox editor-at-large Ezra Klein later discussed the affair in a podcast interview in which Klein accused Harris of \"thinking tribally\" and Harris accused the Vox article of leading people to think he was racist.[103][104]\n\nAccusations of Islamophobia[edit]\nHarris has been accused of Islamophobia by linguist and political commentator Noam Chomsky.[105] After Harris and Chomsky exchanged a series of emails on terrorism and U.S. foreign policy in 2015, Chomsky said Harris had not prepared adequately for the exchange and that this revealed his work as unserious.[106] In a 2016 interview with Al Jazeera English's UpFront, Chomsky further criticized Harris, saying he \"specializes in hysterical, slanderous charges against people he doesn't like.\"[105]\nHarris has countered that his views on this and other topics are frequently misrepresented by \"unethical critics\" who \"deliberately\" take his words out of context.[53] He has also criticized the validity of the term \"Islamophobia\".[107] \"My criticism of Islam is a criticism of beliefs and their consequences, but my fellow liberals reflexively view it as an expression of intolerance toward people,\"[108] he wrote following a disagreement with actor Ben Affleck in October 2014 on the show Real Time with Bill Maher. Affleck had described Harris's and host Bill Maher's views on Muslims as \"gross\" and \"racist\", and Harris's statement that \"Islam is the mother lode of bad ideas\" as an \"ugly thing to say\". Affleck also compared Harris's and Maher's rhetoric to that of people who use antisemitic canards or define African-Americans in terms of intraracial crime.[109] Several conservative American media pundits in turn criticized Affleck and praised Harris and Maher for broaching the topic, saying that discussing it had become taboo.[110]\nHarris's dialogue on Islam with Maajid Nawaz received a combination of positive reviews[111][112][113] and mixed reviews.[114][115] Irshad Manji wrote: \"Their back-and-forth clarifies multiple confusions that plague the public conversation about Islam.\" Of Harris specifically, she said \"[he] is right that liberals must end their silence about the religious motives behind much Islamist terror. At the same time, he ought to call out another double standard that feeds the liberal reflex to excuse Islamists: Atheists do not make nearly enough noise about hatred toward Muslims.\"[115]\nHatewatch staff at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) wrote that members of the \"skeptics\" movement, of which Harris is \"one of the most public faces\", help to \"channel people into the alt-right.\"[116] Bari Weiss wrote that the SPLC had misrepresented Harris's views.[46]\nNathan J. Robinson criticized Harris for promoting the possibility of a nuclear first strike on an Islamist regime if one ever obtained nuclear weapons.[117]\n\nReception and recognition[edit]\nHarris's first two books, in which he lays out his criticisms of religion, received negative reviews from Christian scholars.[58][118][119] From secular sources, the books received a mixture of negative reviews[120][121][122] and positive reviews.[123][124][125][126] In his review of The End of Faith, American historian Alexander Saxton criticized what he called Harris's \"vitriolic and selective polemic against Islam\", (emphasis in original) which he said \"obscure[s] the obvious reality that the invasion of Iraq and the War against Terror are driven by religious irrationalities, cultivated and conceded to, at high policy levels in the U.S., and which are at least comparable to the irrationality of Islamic crusaders and Jihadists.\"[120] By contrast, Stephanie Merritt wrote of the same book that Harris's \"central argument in The End of Faith is sound: religion is the only area of human knowledge in which it is still acceptable to hold beliefs dating from antiquity and a modern society should subject those beliefs to the same principles that govern scientific, medical or geographical inquiry \u2013 particularly if they are inherently hostile to those with different ideas.\"[123] Harris's first book, The End of Faith (2004), won the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for First Nonfiction.[127]\nHarris's next two books, which discuss philosophical issues relating to ethics and free will, received several negative academic reviews.[128][129][130][131][132][133] In his review of The Moral Landscape, neuroscientist Kenan Malik criticized Harris for not engaging adequately with philosophical literature: \"Imagine a sociologist who wrote about evolutionary theory without discussing the work of Darwin, Fisher, Mayr, Hamilton, Trivers or Dawkins on the grounds that he did not come to his conclusions by reading about biology and because discussing concepts such as 'adaptation', 'speciation', 'homology', 'phylogenetics' or 'kin selection' would 'increase the amount of boredom in the universe'. How seriously would we, and should we, take his argument?\"[131] On the other hand, The Moral Landscape received a largely positive review from psychologists James Diller and Andrew Nuzzolilli.[134] Additionally, Free Will received a mixed academic review from philosopher Paul Pardi, who acknowledged that while it suffers from some conceptual confusions and that the core argument is a bit too 'breezy', it serves as a \"good primer on key ideas in physicalist theories of freedom and the will\".[135]\nHarris's book on spirituality and meditation received mainly positive reviews[136][137][60][62] as well as some mixed reviews.[138][61] It was praised by Frank Bruni, for example, who described it as \"so entirely of this moment, so keenly in touch with the growing number of Americans who are willing to say that they do not find the succor they crave, or a truth that makes sense to them, in organized religion.\"[136]\nIn 2018, Robert Wright, a visiting professor of science and religion at Union Theological Seminary, published an article in Wired criticizing Harris, whom he described as \"annoying\" and \"deluded\". Wright wrote that Harris, despite claiming to be a champion of rationality, ignored his own cognitive biases and engaged in faulty and inconsistent arguments in his book The End of Faith. He wrote that \"the famous proponent of New Atheism is on a crusade against tribalism but seems oblivious to his own version of it.\" Wright wrote that these biases are rooted in natural selection and impact everyone, but that they can be mitigated when acknowledged.[104]\nThe UK Business Insider included Harris's podcast in their list of \"8 podcasts that will change how you think about human behavior\" in 2017,[139] and PC Magazine included it in their list of \"The Best Podcasts of 2018\".[140] In January 2020, Max Sanderson included Harris's podcast as a \"Producer pick\" in a \"podcasts of the week\" section for The Guardian.[44] The Waking Up podcast won the 2017 Webby Award for \"People's Voice\" in the category \"Science & Education\" under \"Podcasts & Digital Audio\".[141]\nHarris was included on a list of the \"100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People 2019\" in the Watkins Review, a publication of Watkins Books, a London esoterica bookshop.[142]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 2004, Harris married Annaka Gorton, an author and editor of nonfiction and scientific books after engaging in a common interest about the nature of consciousness.[143] They have two daughters[144][145] and live in Los Angeles.[146]\nIn September 2020, Harris became a member of Giving What We Can, an effective altruism organization whose members pledge to give at least 10% of their income to effective charities, both as an individual and as a company with Waking Up.[50][49]\nHarris practices Brazilian jiu-jitsu.[147][4]\n\nWorks[edit]\nBooks[edit]\n\nHarris, Sam (2004).
