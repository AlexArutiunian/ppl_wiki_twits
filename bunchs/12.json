In 2005, he hit his only major league home run in his only at-bat of the season. It came against Alan Embree of the New York Yankees.\nDuring a 2006 game against the New York Mets, as Rogers came in to pick up a bloop single into left field, the ball took an odd hop and went up his sleeve and he had to reach into the back of his shirt to get it out.\n\nBoston Red Sox[edit]\nBefore the 2007 season, Rogers signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox and was invited to spring training.

In 2021, he received a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for a series on the COVID-19 pandemic. He is the author of two books: I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life (2016) and An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us (2022).\n\n\nEducation[edit]\nEdmund Soon-Weng Yong was born 17 December 1981 in Malaysia.[1][2][3] At the age of 13, Yong immigrated to the UK in 1994. He became a British citizen in 2005.[4]\nYong was awarded Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees in natural sciences (zoology) from Pembroke College, Cambridge[5] in 2002.[6] He completed postgraduate study at University College London (UCL), where he was awarded a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) degree in 2005 in biochemistry.[1]\n\nCareer[edit]\nYong's approach to popular science writing has been described as \"the future of science news\",[7] and he has received numerous awards for his work. Earlier in his career, Yong created and wrote the now-defunct blog Not Exactly Rocket Science, which was published as part of the National Geographic Phenomena blog network. Yong received the National Academies Communication Award from the National Academy of Sciences in 2010 in recognition of his online journalism; in the same year, he received three awards from ResearchBlogging.org, which supports online science journalism focused on covering research that has already been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals that can be adapted for a wider public audience.[8] In 2012 he received the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) Stephen White Award.[9] His blog received the first Best Science Blog award from the Association of British Science Writers in 2014.[10] Yong's interactions with other science bloggers and engagement with those who have commented on his blog have served as case studies for academic work in media studies.[11]\nHis work also has been published by Nature,[12] Scientific American,[13] the BBC,[14] Slate,[15] Aeon,[16] The Guardian,[17] The Times,[6] New Scientist,[18] Wired,[19] The New York Times, and The New Yorker.[6][20]\nIn September 2015, Yong joined The Atlantic as a science reporter.[21] In August 2020, he received the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing's Victor Cohn Prize for Excellence in Medical Science Reporting, citing his reporting on the COVID-19 pandemic and his commitment to including marginalized and underrepresented voices in his writing.[22] In June 2021, he received a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for a series on the COVID-19 pandemic.[23] Yong left The Atlantic in July 2023. \nIn 2016, Yong released the book, I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life which recounts the ubiquitousness of microbes and the relationships microbes have with animals.[24] In 2022, Yong released his second book, An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us, which explores animal perception.[25] The book received the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction, was featured as Book of the Week on BBC Radio 4 in June 2022,[26] named by Publishers Weekly as one of the top ten books of 2022, regardless of genre,[27] and awarded the 2023 Royal Society Trivedi Science Book Prize.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nYong is married to Liz Neeley, a science communicator.[28][29] They occasionally collaborate on speaking engagements.[30][28]\nYong lived in Washington, D.C. until May 2023, when he and Neeley moved to Oakland, California, where they currently reside.[2][31][32]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nNot Exactly Rocket Science.

He has stated that his focus is \"how to make technology and media serve democracy\".[2] He became executive director of MoveOn.org in 2004, where he helped pioneer the practice of online citizen engagement. He is the co-founder of Upworthy, a website for meaningful viral content, and Avaaz, a global citizen's organization. His bestselling book, The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You, introduced the term \u201cfilter bubble\u201d to the lexicon. He is currently an Omidyar Fellow at New America and co-directs the Civic Signals project at the National Conference on Citizenship.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nPariser was born to Dora Lievow of Camden, Maine and Emanuel Pariser of Waterville, Maine. He grew up in Lincolnville, Maine, and in 2000 graduated summa cum laude from Bard College at Simon's Rock with a B.A. in law and political science.[3] In 2005, he returned to Simon's Rock to give the commencement speech.[4] He is Jewish.[5]\n\nCareer[edit]\nPariser's rise to prominence as a political activist began when he and college student David H. Pickering launched an online petition calling for a nonmilitary response to the attacks of September 11. At the time, he was working as a program assistant for the national nonprofit More Than Money. In less than a month, half a million people had signed the petition.\nPariser joined Moveon.org in November 2001, when founders Wes Boyd and Joan Blades invited him to merge his efforts with theirs.[6][7] During the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign, Pariser co-created the Bush in 30 Seconds ad contest and raised over $30 million from small donors to run ads and back Democratic and progressive candidates. Writing for The New York Times Magazine in 2003, journalist George Packer referred to MoveOn as the \"mainstream\" element of what \"may be the fastest-growing protest movement in American history.\"[6] Pariser was the Executive Director of MoveOn.org from 2004 to 2008 and since 2008 has been Board President.\nPariser later became concerned about the development of web personalization. He noticed a pattern of differing responses to search engine queries based on a user's past Internet search history, such that a person with a liberal orientation might get an entirely different set of responses than a conservative if he or she used Google, Facebook, or Yahoo to search for a phrase or term on the Internet.[8] For example, a liberal typing \"BP\" might get information about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, while a conservative typing \"BP\" might get investment information about the oil company.\nAnticipating the dangers of a hyper-personalized Internet, Pariser introduced the term \u201cfilter bubble\u201d to the lexicon in his 2011 New York Times bestselling book, The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You. Bill Gates,[9][10] Sir Tim Berners-Lee,[11] and other internet pioneers[who?] have since expressed concern about the phenomenon,[citation needed] and his 2011 TED talk on the topic now has over five million views.[12] In 2012, he co-founded Upworthy, a media company designed to make civically important ideas popular, with Peter Koechley. Within two years, Upworthy had over 80 million monthly visitors.[13]\nIn 2018, with Professor Talia Stroud, he began work on Civic Signals,[14] with the goal of creating more \u201cpublic-friendly\u201d online spaces, a concept described in his 2019 Ted Talk.[15] Civic Signals is a project of the National Conference on Citizenship. He is currently an affiliate of the Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University, a Langfield Visiting Resident at Princeton University, and an Omidyar Fellow at the New America. He is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders.[16]\n\nWorks[edit]\nEli Pariser, The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You, Penguin Press (New York, May 2011) ISBN\u00a0978-1-59420-300-8\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Sam Sanders (20 June 2017). \"Upworthy Was One Of The Hottest Sites Ever.
