He is the Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership at the New York University Stern School of Business.[1] His main areas of study are the psychology of morality and moral emotions.\nHaidt's main scientific contributions come from the psychological field of moral foundations theory,[2] which attempts to explain the evolutionary origins of human moral reasoning on the basis of innate, gut feelings rather than logic and reason.[3] The theory was later extended to explain the different moral reasoning and how they relate to political ideology, with different political orientations prioritizing different sets of morals.[4] The research served as a foundation for future books on various topics.\nHaidt has written three books for general audiences: The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom (2006) explores the relationship between ancient philosophies and modern science;[5] The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion (2012) examines how morality is shaped by emotion and intuition more than by reasoning, and why differing political groups have different notions of right and wrong;[6] and The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure (2018), co-written with Greg Lukianoff, explores the rising political polarization and changing culture on college campuses, and its effects on mental health.\nHaidt has critiqued the current state of universities and progressive values.[7] He has been named one of the \"top global thinkers\" by Foreign Policy magazine, and one of the \"top world thinkers\" by Prospect magazine.[8][9]\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nHaidt is of Jewish descent (although an atheist as regards religion[10]) and was born in New York City, being raised in Scarsdale, New York.[11][12][13] His grandparents were immigrants from Russia and Poland.[14] He received a BA in philosophy from Yale University in 1985, and an MA in psychology in 1988 and a PhD in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. He then studied cultural psychology at the University of Chicago as a postdoctoral fellow, supervised by Jonathan Baron and Alan Fiske (at the University of Pennsylvania), and cultural anthropologist Richard Shweder (University of Chicago). At Shweder's suggestion, he visited Orissa, India, to continue his research.[15] In 1995, Haidt was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Virginia (UVA), where he worked until 2011, winning four awards for teaching, including a statewide award conferred by the Governor of Virginia.[16]\nIn 1999, Haidt became active in the new field of positive psychology, studying positive moral emotions. This work led to the publication of an edited volume, titled Flourishing, in 2003. In 2004, Haidt began to apply moral psychology to the study of politics, doing research on the psychological foundations of ideology. This work led to the publication in 2012 of The Righteous Mind. Haidt spent the 2007\u20132008 academic year at Princeton University as the Visiting Professor for Distinguished Teaching.[17]\nIn 2011, after a 16-year stint at UVA, Haidt moved to New York University's Stern School of Business as the Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership. He made the move to New York City with his wife, Jayne, and 2 children.[18][19] In 2013, he co-founded Ethical Systems, a non-profit collaboration dedicated to making academic research on ethics widely available to businesses.[20] In 2015, Haidt co-founded Heterodox Academy, a non-profit organization that works to increase viewpoint diversity, mutual understanding, and productive disagreement.[21][self-published source] In 2018, Haidt and Richard Reeves co-edited an illustrated edition of John Stuart Mill's On Liberty, titled All Minus One: John Stuart Mill\u2019s Ideas on Free Speech Illustrated (illustrated by Dave Cicirelli). Haidt's current research applies moral psychology to business ethics.[22]\n\nResearch contributions[edit]\nHaidt speaking at the Miller Center of Public Affairs in Charlottesville (March 19, 2012).\nHaidt's research on morality has led to publications and theoretical advances in four key areas.[23]\n\nMoral disgust[edit]\nMain article: Disgust \u00a7\u00a0Morality\nTogether with Paul Rozin and Clark McCauley, Haidt developed the Disgust Scale,[24] which has been widely used to measure individual differences in sensitivity to disgust.[25] Haidt, Rozin, and McCauley have written on the psychology of disgust as an emotion that began as a guardian of the mouth (against pathogens), but then expanded during biological and cultural evolution to become a guardian of the body more generally, and of the social and moral order.[26]\n\nMoral elevation[edit]\nMain article: Elevation (emotion)\nWith Sara Algoe, Haidt argued that exposure to stories about moral beauty (the opposite of moral disgust) cause a common set of responses, including warm, loving feelings, calmness, and a desire to become a better person.[27] Haidt called the emotion moral elevation,[28] as a tribute to Thomas Jefferson, who had described the emotion in detail in a letter discussing the benefits of reading great literature.[29] Feelings of moral elevation cause increases in milk produced during lactation in breastfeeding mothers,[30] suggesting the involvement of the hormone oxytocin.\n\nSocial intuitionism[edit]\nMain article: Social intuitionism\nHaidt's principal line of research has been on the nature and mechanisms of moral judgment. In the 1990s, he developed the social intuitionist model, which posits that moral judgment is mostly based on automatic processes\u2014moral intuitions\u2014rather than on conscious reasoning.[31] People engage in reasoning largely to find evidence to support their initial intuitions. Haidt's main paper on the social intuitionist model, \"The Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail\", has been cited over 7,800 times.[32]\n\nMoral foundations theory[edit]\nMain article: Moral foundations theory\nA simple graphic depicting survey data from the United States intended to support moral foundations theory.\nIn 2004, Haidt began to extend the social intuitionist model to identify what he considered to be the most important categories of moral intuition.[33] The resulting moral foundations theory, co-developed with Craig Joseph and Jesse Graham, and based in part on the writings of Richard Shweder, was intended to explain cross-cultural differences in morality. The theory posited that there are at least five innate moral foundations, upon which cultures develop their various moralities, just as there are five innate taste receptors on the tongue, which cultures have used to create many different cuisines. The five values are:[34]\n\nCare/harm\nFairness/cheating\nLoyalty/betrayal\nAuthority/subversion\nSanctity/degradation.\nHaidt and his collaborators asserted that the theory also works well to explain political differences. According to Haidt, liberals tend to endorse primarily the care and fairness foundations, whereas conservatives tend to endorse all foundations more equally.[34] Later, in The Righteous Mind, a sixth foundation, Liberty/oppression, was presented.\n\n\"The Elephant and the Rider\"[edit]\nOne widely cited metaphor throughout Haidt's books is that of the elephant and the rider. His observations of social intuitionism, the notion that intuitions come first and rationalization second, led to the metaphor described in his work.[35] The rider represents consciously controlled processes, and the elephant represents automatic processes. The metaphor corresponds to Systems 1 and 2 described in Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow.[36] This metaphor is used extensively in both The Happiness Hypothesis and The Righteous Mind.\n\nNon-academic works[edit]\nHaidt has authored the following non-academic books for general audiences, related to various subjects in psychology and politics.\n\nThe Happiness Hypothesis[edit]\nMain article: The Happiness Hypothesis\nThe Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom (2006) draws on ancient philosophical ideas in light of contemporary scientific research to extract potential lessons and how they may apply to everyday life.[37] The book poses \"ten Great Ideas\" on happiness espoused by philosophers and thinkers of the past \u2014 Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Jesus, and others \u2014 and then considers what modern scientific research has to say regarding these ideas.[38]\n\nThe Righteous Mind[edit]\nMain article: The Righteous Mind\nThe Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion (2012) draws on Haidt's previous research on moral foundations theory. It argues that moral judgments arise not from logical reason, but from gut feelings, asserting that liberals, conservatives, and libertarians have different intuitions about right and wrong because they prioritize different values.\n\nThe Coddling of the American Mind[edit]\nMain article: The Coddling of the American Mind\nThe Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure (2018), co-written with Greg Lukianoff, expands on an essay the authors wrote for The Atlantic in 2015.[39] The book explores the rising political polarization and changing culture on college campuses and its effects on mental health. It also explores changes in childhood, including the rise of \"fearful parenting,\" the decline of unsupervised play, and the effects of social media in the last decade.[40]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nHaidt describes how he began to study political psychology in order to help the Democratic Party win more elections, and argues that each of the major political groups\u2014conservatives, progressives, and libertarians\u2014have valuable insights and that truth and good policy emerge from the contest of ideas.[41] Since 2012, Haidt has referred to himself as a political centrist.[42][43][44]\nHaidt is involved with several efforts to help bridge the political divide and reduce political polarization in the United States. In 2007, he founded the website CivilPolitics.org, a clearinghouse for research on political civility.[45] He serves on the advisory boards of RepresentUs, a non-partisan anti-corruption organization; the Acumen Fund, which invests in companies, leaders, and ideas that are changing the way the world tackles poverty; and braverangels.org, a bipartisan group working to reduce political polarization.\nIn 2019, Haidt argued that there is a \"very good chance American democracy will fail, that in the next 30 years we will have a catastrophic failure of our democracy.\"[46]\n\nReception[edit]\nWhile himself an atheist,[10] Haidt has argued that religion contains psychological wisdom that can promote human flourishing, and that the New Atheists have themselves succumbed to moralistic dogma.[10] These contentions elicited a variety of responses in a 2007 online debate sponsored by the website Edge. PZ Myers praised the first part of Haidt's essay while disagreeing with his criticism of the New Atheists; Sam Harris criticized Haidt for his perceived obfuscation of harms caused by religion; Michael Shermer praised Haidt; and biologist David Sloan Wilson joined Haidt in criticizing the New Atheists for dismissing the notion that religion is an evolutionary adaptation.[10]\nDavid Mikics of Tablet magazine profiled Haidt as \"the high priest of heterodoxy\" and praised his work to increase intellectual diversity at universities through Heterodox Academy.[47]\nIn 2020, Peter Wehner wrote in The Atlantic, \"Over the past decade, no one has added more to my understanding of how we think about, discuss, and debate politics and religion than Jonathan Haidt.\" He added that, \"In his own field, in his own way, Jonathan Haidt is trying to heal our divisions and temper some of the hate, to increase our wisdom and understanding, and to urge us to show a bit more compassion toward one another.\"[48]\n\nPublications[edit]\nBooks[edit]\n2002.

After training in medicine and specialising in neurology in the late 1950s, he came to prominence in the early 1960s in the comedy revue Beyond the Fringe with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.\nMiller began directing operas in the 1970s. His 1982 production of a \"Mafia\"-styled Rigoletto was set in 1950s Little Italy, Manhattan. In its early days, he was an associate director at the National Theatre. He later ran the Old Vic Theatre. As a writer and presenter of more than a dozen BBC documentaries, Miller became a television personality and public intellectual in Britain and the United States.\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\nEarly life[edit]\nMiller grew up in St John's Wood, London, in a well-connected Jewish family. His father Emanuel (1892\u20131970), who was of Lithuanian descent and suffered from severe rheumatoid arthritis, was a military psychiatrist and subsequently a paediatric psychiatrist at Harley House. His mother, Betty Miller (n\u00e9e Spiro) (1910\u20131965), was a novelist and biographer who was originally from County Cork, Ireland. Miller had an elder sister, Sarah (died 2006) who worked in television for many years and retained an involvement with Judaism that Miller, as an atheist, always eschewed. The young Miller was brought for assessment to several child psychiatrists, including Donald Winnicott. As a teenager he had many sessions with the psychiatrist Leopold Stein, whose sessions he enjoyed and in which they \"simply conversed about philosophy and Hughlings Jackson's early neurological theories.\"[1]\nMiller moved between several different schools prior to attending Taunton School,[2] including for a time at the Rudolf Steiner School Kings Langley (a Waldorf school) where he was taught by two of Ivy Compton-Burnett's sisters and says of that time that he \"never learnt anything at all\".[3] [4] Miller concluded his secondary school education at St Paul's School, London[5] where he developed an early (and ultimately lifelong) interest in the biological sciences. While at St Paul's School at the age of 12, Miller met and became close friends with Oliver Sacks and Sacks's best friend Eric Korn, friendships which remained crucial throughout the rest of their lives. In 1953, before leaving secondary school, he performed comedy several times on the BBC radio programme  Under Twenty Parade.[6] Miller studied natural sciences and medicine at St John's College, Cambridge (MB BChir, 1959), where he was a member of the Cambridge Apostles and one of cast\u2019s three Granta cartoonist, before going on to train at University College Hospital in London.[citation needed]\nWhile studying medicine, Miller was involved in  the Cambridge Footlights, appearing in the revues Out of the Blue (1954) and Between the Lines (1955). Good reviews for these shows, and for Miller's performances in particular, led to his performing on a number of radio and television shows while continuing his studies; these included appearances on Saturday Night on the Light, Tonight and Sunday Night at the London Palladium. He qualified as a physician in 1959 and then worked as a hospital house officer for two years, including at the Central Middlesex Hospital as house physician for gastroenterologist Francis Avery Jones.\n\n1960s: Beyond the Fringe[edit]\nMiller (far right) in Beyond the Fringe on Broadway, with (from left) Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett and Peter Cook\nMiller helped to write and produce the satirical  revue Beyond the Fringe, which premiered at the Edinburgh Festival in August 1960. This launched, in addition to his own, the careers of Alan Bennett, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Miller quit the show shortly after its move from London to Broadway in 1962, and took over as editor and presenter of the BBC's arts programme Monitor in 1965. The Monitor appointment arose because Miller had approached Huw Wheldon about taking up a place on the BBC's director training course. Wheldon assured him that he would \"pick it up as he went along\".[citation needed]\nMiller's first experience of directing a stage-play was for John Osborne, whose Under Plain Cover he directed in 1962.[7] In 1964, he directed the play The Old Glory by the American poet Robert Lowell in New York City. It was the first play produced at the American Place Theatre and starred Frank Langella, Roscoe Lee Brown, and Lester Rawlins. The play won five Obie Awards in 1965 including an award for \"Best American Play\" as well as awards for Langella, Brown and Rawlins.[8][9][10][11]\nHe wrote, produced, and directed an adaptation for television of Alice in Wonderland (1966) for the BBC. He followed this with Whistle and I'll Come to You (1968) starring Michael Hordern, a television adaptation of M. R. James's 1904 ghost story \"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\". He produced a National Theatre Company production of The Merchant of Venice starring Laurence Olivier. He later resigned as associate director.\n\n1970s: Medical history and opera[edit]\nMiller held a research fellowship in the history of medicine at University College London from 1970 to 1973. In 1974, he also started directing and producing operas for Kent Opera and Glyndebourne, followed by a new production of The Marriage of Figaro for English National Opera in 1978. Miller's other turns as an opera director included productions of Rigoletto (in 1975 and 1982) and the operetta The Mikado (in 1987).\nMiller drew upon his own experiences as a physician as writer and presenter of the BBC television series The Body in Question (1978),[12] which caused some controversy for showing the dissection of a cadaver. For a time, he was a vice-president of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality.[13] In 1971, he defended multiracial immigration to the UK at length with Enoch Powell on The Dick Cavett Show.[14]\n\n1980s: Shakespeare and neuropsychology[edit]\nIn 1980, Miller was persuaded to join the troubled BBC Television Shakespeare project (1978\u201385). He became producer (1980\u201382) and directed six of the plays himself, beginning with a well received Taming of the Shrew starring John Cleese. In the early 1980s, Miller was a popular and frequent guest on PBS' Dick Cavett Show.[citation needed]\nMiller wrote and presented the BBC television series, and accompanying book, States of Mind in 1983 and the same year directed Roger Daltrey as Macheath, the outlaw hero of the BBC's production of John Gay's 1728 ballad opera, The Beggar's Opera. He also became chair of Edinburgh Festival Fringe board of directors.[citation needed] In 1984, he studied neuropsychology with Dr. Sandra Witelson at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, before becoming a neuropsychology research fellow at the University of Sussex the following year.[citation needed]\n\n1990s[edit]\nIn 1990, Miller wrote and presented a joint BBC/Canadian production titled, Born Talking: A Personal Inquiry into Language. The four-part series looked into the acquisition of language, and complexities surrounding language production, with special focus on sign language used by deaf people. This interest was contemporaneous with his friend Oliver Sacks' immersion in, and writing/publishing a book about Deaf Culture and deaf people entitled Seeing Voices.  Miller then wrote and presented the television series Madness (1991) and Jonathan Miller on Reflection (1998). The five-part Madness series ran on PBS in 1991. It featured a brief history of madness and interviews with psychiatric researchers, clinical psychiatrists, and patients in therapy sessions. In 1992, Opera Omaha staged the United States premiere of the Gioachino Rossini's 1819 opera Ermione, directed by Miller.[citation needed]\n\n2000s: Atheism and return to directing[edit]\nIn 2004, Miller wrote and presented a television series on atheism entitled Atheism: A Rough History of Disbelief (more commonly referred to as Jonathan Miller's Brief History of Disbelief) for BBC Four, exploring the roots of his own atheism and investigating the history of atheism in the world. Individual conversations, debates and discussions for the series that could not be included due to time constraints were aired in a six-part series entitled The Atheism Tapes. He also appeared on a BBC Two programme in February 2004, called What the World Thinks of God appearing from New York. The original three-part series aired on public television in the United States in 2007.[15]\nIn 2007, Miller directed The Cherry Orchard at The Crucible, Sheffield, his first work on the British stage for 10 years. He also directed Monteverdi's L'Orfeo in Manchester and Bristol, and Der Rosenkavalier in Tokyo and gave talks throughout Britain during 2007 called An Audience with Jonathan Miller in which he spoke about his life for an hour and then fielded questions from the audience. He also curated an exhibition on camouflage at the Imperial War Museum. He appeared at the Royal Society of the Arts in London discussing humour (4 July 2007) and at the British Library on religion (3 September 2007).[citation needed]\nIn January 2009, after a break of 12 years, Miller returned to the English National Opera to direct his own production of La boh\u00e8me, notable for its 1930s setting. This same production ran at the Cincinnati Opera in July 2010, also directed by Miller.\n\n2010s[edit]\nOn 15 September 2010, Miller, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in The Guardian, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK.[16] In April and May 2011, Miller directed Verdi's La traviata in Vancouver, Canada,[17] and in February and March 2012, Mozart's Cos\u00ec fan tutte in Washington, D.C.[18]\nOn 25 November 2015, the University of London awarded Miller an honorary degree in Literature.[19]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMiller married Rachel Collet in 1956. They had two sons and a daughter.[20] From 1961 to his death he lived on Gloucester Crescent in Camden Town, north London.[21] On 27 November 2019, Miller died at the age of 85, following a long battle with Alzheimer's.[22]\n\nParodies and representations[edit]\nStevie Smith, a friend of his mother Betty Miller, \"rather disloyally\" included a thinly disguised and uncomplimentary version of the nine-year-old Miller, \"precocious and brattish... constantly demanding attention\", in her short story 'Beside the Seaside: A Holiday with Children' (1949).[1]\nPrivate Eye (which had a falling-out with Miller[23]) occasionally lampooned him under the name \"Dr Jonathan\", depicting him as a Dr Johnson-like self-important man of learning.[24]\nIn the film for television Not Only But Always about the careers of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, Jonathan Aris played Jonathan Miller as a young man; Aris reprised the role in the BBC Radio 4 play Good Evening (2008) by Roy Smiles.\nAlong with the other members of Beyond the Fringe, he is portrayed in the play Pete and Dud: Come Again by Chris Bartlett and Nick Awde.\nIn the BBC Radio Four series The Burkiss Way edition 35, broadcast on 2 April 1979, he was impersonated by Nigel Rees in a fairly lengthy parody \"The Blood Gushing All over the Screen in Question\", in which the history of nasty diseases was traced and the style of Miller's presentation was  sent up. It was written by Andrew Marshall and David Renwick.\nIn the 1980s a puppet of Miller appeared frequently in Spitting Image sketches, most notably \"Bernard Levin and Jonathan Miller Talk Bollocks\".\nHonours and awards[edit]\nSpecial Tony Award (1963), with co-stars Alan Bennett, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, \"for their brilliance which has shattered all the old concepts of comedy\" in the musical revue Beyond the Fringe.\nDistinguished Supporter, Humanists UK.\nHonorary Associate, National Secular Society.[25]\nHonorary Fellow, University College London.\nHonorary Fellow, Royal College of Art.\nAssociate member, Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.\nHonorary Fellow, St John's College, Cambridge (1982).\nHonorary Fellow, Royal College of Physicians (London and Edinburgh).\nHonorary D.Phil., University of Cambridge.\nCommander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE; 1983).\nNomination: Best Director Tony Award (1986), for his revival of O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night.\nKnight Bachelor (2002), for services to music and the arts.\nNominated artist of honour at Bornholm thanks to his instruction in R\u00f8nne Theater (Opera Island Bornholm; 2003).\nForeign Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nPresident, Rationalist Association (2006\u20132019)[26]\nLifetime Achievement Award, Medical Journalists' Association (2012)\nBibliography[edit]\nBooks[edit]\nMiller, Jonathan (1971).

He has also testified in multiple impeachment hearings and removal trials in Congress, including the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and both the first and second impeachments of President Donald Trump.[4][5] Turley is a First Amendment advocate and writes frequently on free speech restrictions in the private and public sectors.[6][7][8] Turley is a Fox News contributor.[9] He is the author of The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in the Age of Rage (Simon & Schuster 2024).[10]\nAs an attorney, Turley has worked on notable cases in civil rights defense including the defense of Dr. Sami Al-Arian, NSA whistleblower David Faulk, protesters at the World Bank/IMF demonstrations in 2000, and the Brown family in their challenge to Utah polygamy laws. Turley has also served as counsel on prominent Federal cases including the defense of Area 51 workers, and as lead counsel in the 2014 challenge to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nTurley grew up in Chicago as the youngest of five children. His father, John (Jack) Turley was an international architect, partner at Skidmore, Owens, and Merrill, and the former associate of famed modernist architect Mies van der Rohe. Turley has written about his father's influence on his constitutional theories.[11] His mother, Angela Piazza Turley, was a social worker and activist who was the former president of Jane Addams Hull-House in Chicago. He is of Irish and Italian ancestry.[12]\nTurley served as a House leadership page in 1977 and 1978 under the sponsorship of Illinois Democrat Sidney Yates.[13]\nHe received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1983, and a Juris Doctor degree from Northwestern University School of Law in 1987. He served as Executive Articles Editor of Northwestern University Law Review.\nDuring the Reagan Administration, Turley worked as an intern with the general counsel\u2019s office of the National Security Agency (NSA).[14][15]\n\nCareer[edit]\nTestifying to Congress, 2007Turley holds the Shapiro Chair for Public Interest Law at The George Washington University Law School, where he teaches torts, criminal procedure, and constitutional law. He is the youngest person to receive an academic chair in the school's history. He runs the Project for Older Prisoners (POP),[16][17] the Environmental Law Clinic, and the Environmental Legislation Project.[18]\nPrior to joining George Washington University, he was on the faculty of Tulane University Law School.[18]\nHis articles on legal and policy issues have appeared in national publications; he has had articles published in The New York Times,[19] The Washington Post,[20] USA Today,[21] the Los Angeles Times,[16] and the Wall Street Journal.[22] He frequently appears in the national media as a commentator on a multitude of subjects[23][24] ranging from the 2000 U.S. presidential election controversy to the Terri Schiavo case in 2005.[25] He often is a guest on Sunday talk shows,[23] with more than two-dozen appearances on Meet the Press, ABC This Week, Face the Nation, and Fox News Sunday. He served as a contributor on Countdown with Keith Olbermann from 2003 until 2011 on MSNBC, and later on Current TV[26] in 2011 and early 2012.\nSince the 1990s, he has been a legal analyst for NBC News, CBS News, the BBC and Fox News, covering stories that ranged from the Clinton impeachment to presidential elections.[27][18] He is on the board of contributors of USA Today[28] and is a columnist with The Hill.[29] He is currently a legal analyst with Fox News.[30]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nThis section needs expansion with: up-to-date content that follows some logical structure, e.g., chronology of date of published opinion, or grouping of stated opinions, with statements chronological within those (so evolution of perspective can be gleaned). You can help by adding to it.  (January 2020)\nTurley in 2016\nIn appearances on Countdown with Keith Olbermann and The Rachel Maddow Show, he called for criminal prosecution of Bush administration officials for war crimes, including torture.[31]\nIn USA Today in October 2004, he argued for the legalization of polygamy,[32] provoking responses from writers such as Stanley Kurtz.[33][34]\nHe has opined that the Supreme Court is injecting itself into partisan politics.[35] He frequently has expressed the view that recent[when?] nominees to the court hold extreme views.[36][dead link][37][dead link]\nIn October 2006, in an interview by Keith Olbermann of MSNBC, he expressed strong disapproval of the Military Commissions Act of 2006.[38] Commenting on the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which he contends does away with habeas corpus, Turley says, \"It's something that no one thought\u2014certainly I didn't think\u2014was possible in the United States. And I am not too sure how we got to this point. But people clearly don't realize what a fundamental change it is about who we are as a country. What happened today changed us.\"[38]\nWhen the U.S. Senate was about to vote on Michael Mukasey for U.S. attorney general, Turley said, \"The attorney general nominee's evasive remarks on 'water-boarding' should disqualify him from the job.\"[39] On the treatment of terrorism suspect Jos\u00e9 Padilla, Turley says, \"The treatment of Padilla ranks as one of the most serious abuses after 9/11... This is a case that would have shocked the Framers. This is precisely what many of the drafters of the Constitution had in mind when they tried to create a system of checks and balances.\" Turley considers the case of great import on the grounds that \"Padilla's treatment by the military could happen to others.\"[40]\nTurley has said, \"It is hard to read the Second Amendment and not honestly conclude that the Framers intended gun ownership to be an individual right.\"[41]\nWhen Congressional Democrats asked the Justice Department to investigate the CIA's destruction of terrorist interrogation tapes Turley said, \"these are very serious allegations, that raise as many as six identifiable crimes ranging from contempt of Congress, to contempt of Justice, to perjury, to false statements.\"[42]\nTurley disagrees with the theory that dealing with bullies is just a part of growing up, claiming that they are \"no more a natural part of learning than is parental abuse a natural part of growing up\" and believes that \"litigation could succeed in forcing schools to take bullying more seriously\".[43]\nHe has written extensively in opposition to the death penalty, noting, \"Human error remains a principal cause of botched executions... eventually society will be forced to deal directly with a fundamental moral question: Has death itself become the intolerable element of the death penalty?\"[44]\nHe is a critic of special treatment for the church in law, asking why there are laws that \"expressly exempt faith-based actions that result in harm.\"[45]\nOn October 11, 2016, Libertarian Party candidate for President, Gary Johnson, announced that if he was elected President, Turley would be one of his two top choices for the Supreme Court seat that remained open following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[46] Turley has been repeatedly named as a top pick for the Court by libertarian presidential candidates, including in 2020.[47]\nIn a 2017 column for The Hill, Turley was critical of military intervention in the Middle East and questioned its constitutionality. He also mentioned that he supported the Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch.[48]\nIn the wake of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Turley argued that, despite his doubts that fraud existed, Americans should welcome the involvement of the courts to vet and validate the election results.[49]\n\nObama administration views[edit]\nIn another commentary, Turley defended Judge Henry E. Hudson's ruling declaring the individual mandate in health insurance unconstitutional for violating the Commerce Clause of the Constitution: \"It's very thoughtful\u2014not a screed. I don't see any evidence this is motivated by Judge Hudson's personal beliefs... Anybody who's dismissing this opinion as a political screed has obviously not read the opinion.\"[50]\nTurley described U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in an op-ed as President Barack Obama's sin-eater, writing:\n\nFor Obama, there has been no better sin eater than Holder. When the president promised CIA employees early in his first term that they would not be investigated for torture, it was the attorney general who shielded officials from prosecution. When the Obama administration decided it would expand secret and warrantless surveillance, it was Holder who justified it. When the president wanted the authority to kill any American he deemed a threat without charge or trial, it was Holder who went public to announce the \"kill list\" policy. Last week, the Justice Department confirmed that it was Holder who personally approved the equally abusive search of Fox News correspondent James Rosen's e-mail and phone records in another story involving leaked classified information. In the 2010 application for a secret warrant, the Obama administration named Rosen as \"an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator\" to the leaking of classified materials. The Justice Department even investigated Rosen's parents' telephone number, and Holder was there to justify every attack on the news media.[51]\nIn a December 2013 congressional hearing, responding to a question from Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) about presidential power in the Obama administration, Turley said:\n\nThe danger is quite severe. The problem with what the president is doing is that he's not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system. He's becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid. That is the concentration of power in every single branch. This Newtonian orbit that the three branches exist in is a delicate one but it is designed to prevent this type of concentration. There is [sic] two trends going on which should be of equal concern to all members of Congress. One is that we have had the radical expansion of presidential powers under both President Bush and President Obama. We have what many once called an imperial presidency model of largely unchecked authority. And with that trend we also have the continued rise of this fourth branch. We have agencies that are quite large that issue regulations. The Supreme Court said recently that agencies could actually define their own or interpret their own jurisdiction.[52]\nOn November 21, 2014, Turley agreed to represent House Speaker John Boehner and the Republican Party in a suit filed against the Obama administration alleging unconstitutional implementation of the Affordable Care Act, specifically the individual mandate.[53] In 2016, the federal court ruled that the Obama Administration violated the separation of powers in ordering billions to be paid to insurance companies without an appropriation of Congress.[54]\n\nTestimony before Congress[edit]\nThe conceptual thread running through many of the issues taken on by Turley is that they involve claims of executive privilege. For example, he said that the president's claim of executive authority based on Article Two \"would put our system on a slippery slope.\"[55] He has argued against national security exceptions to fundamental constitutional rights.[36][56]\nHe is a frequent witness before the House and Senate on constitutional and statutory issues,[57][58] as well as tort reform legislation.[18]\nTurley has testified regularly during national controversies. He testified at the confirmation hearings of Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch,[59] Attorney General Loretta Lynch,[60] and Attorney General William Barr.[61] He also testified during the Clinton impeachment hearings.[5] Turley, in his capacity as a constitutional scholar,[62] testified in favor of the Clinton impeachment.[63][64] He was quoted extensively by congressman James Rogan during the impeachment of Bill Clinton.[65]\nTurley also testified in Congress against President Bush's warrantless domestic surveillance program and was lead counsel in a case challenging it. In regard to warrantless wiretaps he noted that, \"Judge Anna Diggs Taylor chastised the government for a flagrant abuse of the Constitution and, in a direct message to the president, observed that there are no hereditary kings in America.\"[66]\n\nViews on Trump impeachments[edit]\nOn December 4, 2019, Turley testified before the House Judiciary Committee regarding the constitutional grounds for presidential impeachment in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, arguing against a Trump impeachment.[4][67][68][69] In his testimony, Turley objected to the effort to craft articles of impeachment around four criminal allegations: bribery, extortion, obstruction of justice, and campaign finance violations.[70]  He argued that the evidence did not meet the standard definitions of those crimes, contrary to the testimony of the three Democratic witnesses that such legal definitions have always been used as a measure for impeachment deliberations.[70]  Turley objected to the lower of the impeachment standards to \"fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger.\"[71] The Committee ultimately rejected all four of those articles and adopted the two that Turley argued could be legitimate if proven: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.[72]  Where the Committee departed from the testimony was the rejection of Turley's call for more time to develop a more complete record rather than fulfill a promise to impeach by Christmas\u2014an issue that was rekindled by the delay in the submission of the articles to the Senate as new evidence emerged in 2020.[73]\nIt was observed that his prior reasoning for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton contradicted the opinions he shared against the impeachment of President Donald Trump.[67][68][69] Turley sought to clarify his positions regarding the two impeachments the next day in an op-ed.[74] Turley noted that in both hearings he stressed that a president could be impeached for non-criminal acts, including abuse of power, and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler ended the Trump impeachment hearings by quoting him to that effect. He has noted that the only disagreement was the sufficiency of the record and his calling on House to issue subpoenas for key witnesses like former national security adviser John Bolton.[74] The push for additional time was due in part to Turley's concern that the House was going to impeach a president for going to the courts rather than yielding to congressional demands for witnesses and documents.[75] Given the short period of investigation, Turley objected that such a move would effectively make seeking judicial review as high crime and misdemeanor. He noted that both Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were able to go all the way to the Supreme Court on their challenges before impeachment.[76] While Turley told the Committee that such judicial opinions were not required to impeach on obstruction, the abbreviated period of investigation undermined the foundation of that article.[77]\nTurley was cited by both the White House and House managers in their arguments before the United States Senate in the Trump impeachment trial.[78]  During the trial, Turley opposed the White House argument that impeachment requires a criminal allegation.[79] Turley wrote in the Washington Post that \"If some of the president\u2019s critics are adopting a far too broad understanding of impeachable offenses, the White House is adopting a far too narrow one.\"[80]\nAfter the second impeachment of Donald Trump he said there could not be a trial after Trump left office.[81] Turley's views were also cited on the House floor in the second impeachment of President Donald Trump in January 2021, particularly his opposition to what he called a \"snap impeachment.\"[82] Turley opposed the decision to forego any hearing to consider the implications of such a rapid impeachment, consider changes to the language, and allow for a formal response from President Trump.[83] While Turley said that Trump's conduct could amount to impeachable conduct, he expressed reservations over the specific language of the article on free speech grounds.[83]  He condemned Trump's speech before the riot on Twitter when it was still being given and opposed the challenge to the electoral votes from the outset.[84] He argued for a bipartisan, bicameral vote of censure to condemn Trump for the harm that he caused the nation with his speech.[84] Turley declined to represent President Trump[85] but did speak to Republican senators before both the first Trump trial[86] and the second Trump trial.[87]\n\nAwards[edit]\nTurley was ranked as 38th in the top 100 most cited \"public intellectuals\" (and second most cited law professor) in a 2001 study by Judge Richard Posner of intellectuals referenced in the media and public debates.[88]\nIn 2005, Turley was given the Columnist of the Year award for Single-Issue Advocacy for his columns on civil liberties by the Aspen Institute[18] and The Week magazine.[89]\nIn 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of law from John Marshall Law School in recognition of his career as an advocate of civil liberties and constitutional rights.[90]\nHe was ranked among the nation's top 500 lawyers in 2008.[91] Turley was found to be the second most cited law professor in the country as well as being ranked as one of the top ten military lawyers.[18]\nIn 2008 his blog was ranked as the top law professor blog and legal theory blog by the American Bar Association Journal survey of the top 100 blogs.[92][93] His work with older prisoners has been honored in various states, including his selection as the 2011 recipient of the Dr. Mary Ann Quaranta Elder Justice Award at Fordham University.[27] He has also been ranked in the top five most popular law professors on Twitter.[94] \u00a0He has received other awards including the James Madison award and was declared one of four university fellows at the Utah Valley University in 2019.[27]\n\nProminent cases[edit]\nTurley has served as counsel in notable cases; representing whistleblowers, military personnel, and a wide range of other clients in national security, environmental, and constitutional law cases. His  cases as lead counsel have secured decisions striking down both a federal and a state law,[27] among them:\n\nLarry Hanauer, a House Intelligence Committee staff member falsely accused of leaking classified information to The New York Times[95]\nDavid Faulk, a whistleblower who revealed abuses at NSA's Fort Gordon surveillance programs[96]\nDr. Eric Foretich,[58] in overturning the Elizabeth Morgan Act in 2003[97]\nFormer Judge Thomas Porteous's impeachment trial defense[57] Turley characterized Porteous's chronic bribe-taking as merely being a \"moocher\", convicted on four articles of impeachment, removed as judge by a Senate vote of 94-2[98][99]\nDefendants in terrorism cases, including Ali al-Tamimi (the alleged head of the Virginia Jihad/Paintball conspiracy)-[100] On September 1, 2020, a federal court found that his challenges to his conviction had merit and ordered his release to Turley at Supermax in Colorado to drive back to Virginia to avoid risks of Covid-19.[101]\nArea 51 workers at a secret air base in Nevada.[102][103]\nLead counsel in the litigation over the mass arrests at the World Bank/IMF protests in Washington.[104]\nTurley represented the Rocky Flats grand jury in Colorado[105]\nTurley testified on December 4, 2019, regarding the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, regarding constitutional issues not supporting the impeachment of Trump.[106]\nTurley filed a challenge to the Libyan War on behalf of ten members of Congress. The lawsuit was before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.[107]\nPersonal life[edit]\nTurley married his wife, Leslie, in 1997. They have four children.[108][109]\n\nSwatting[edit]\nOn December 29, 2023, Turley was targetted as part of the 2023 swatting attempts of American politicians.[110]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Jonathan Turley - Res ipso loquitur (\"The thing itself speaks\")\".

    "wiki": "American author (born 1943)\n\n\nJoyce MeyerMeyer speaking in 2015BornPauline Joyce Hutchison (1943-06-04) June 4, 1943 (age\u00a080)St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.OccupationBible teacher, author, speakerSpouseDave Meyer (2nd husband)Websitejoycemeyer.org\nPauline Joyce Meyer (n\u00e9e Hutchison; June 4, 1943)[citation needed] is an American Charismatic Christian author, speaker, and president of Joyce Meyer Ministries.  Joyce and her husband, Dave, have four grown children and live outside St. Louis, Missouri. Her ministry is headquartered near the St. Louis suburb of Fenton, Missouri.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nMeyer was born Pauline Joyce Hutchison in south St. Louis in 1943.[citation needed] Her father went into the army to fight in World War II soon after she was born. She has said in interviews that he began sexually abusing her upon his return, and discusses this experience in her meetings.[1]\nA graduate of O'Fallon Technical High School in St. Louis, she married a part-time car salesman shortly after her senior year of high school. The marriage lasted five years. She maintains that her husband frequently cheated on her and persuaded her to steal payroll checks from her employer. They used the money to go on a vacation to California. She states that she returned the money years later.[1] After her divorce, Meyer frequented local bars before meeting Dave Meyer, an engineering draftsman. They were married on January 7, 1967.\n\nConversion and ministry[edit]\nMeyer also reports that during an intense prayer while driving to work one morning in 1976, she heard God call her name. She was born again at age nine, but unhappiness drove her deeper into her faith. She got home later that day from a beauty appointment \"full of liquid love\" and was \"drunk with the Spirit of God\" that night while at the local bowling alley.[1]\n\n... I didn't have any knowledge. I didn't go to church. And I had a lot of problems, and I needed somebody to kind of help me along. And I think sometimes even people who want to serve God, if they have got so many problems that they don't think right and they don't act right and they don't behave right, they almost need somebody to take them by the hand and help lead them through the early years ...[2]\nMeyer was briefly a member of Our Savior's Lutheran Church in St. Louis, a congregation of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod.[1][3] She began leading an early-morning Bible class at a local cafeteria and became active in Life Christian Center, a charismatic church in Fenton. Within a few years, Meyer was the church's associate pastor. The church became one of the leading charismatic churches in the area, largely because of her popularity as a Bible teacher.[1] She also began airing a daily 15-minute radio broadcast on a St. Louis radio station.\nIn 1985, Meyer resigned as associate pastor and founded her own ministry, initially called \"Life in the Word.\" She began airing her radio show on six other stations from Chicago to Kansas City.\nIn 1993, her husband, Dave, suggested starting a television ministry.[1] Initially airing on superstation WGN-TV in Chicago and Black Entertainment Television (BET), her program, now called Enjoying Everyday Life, is still on the air today.\nIn 2002, mainstream publisher Hachette Book Group paid Meyer over $10 million for the rights to her backlist catalog of independently released books.[4]\nIn 2004, St. Louis Christian television station KNLC, operated by the Rev. Larry Rice of New Life Evangelistic Center, dropped Meyer's programming. According to Rice, a longstanding Meyer supporter, Meyer's \"excessive lifestyle\" and her teachings \"often going beyond Scripture\" were the impetus for canceling the program.[5]\nIn 2005, Time magazine's \"25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America\" ranked Meyer as 17th.[6]\n\nSalary and finances[edit]\nJoyce Meyer used to travel in this Canadair Challenger 600S; seen here in Sydney, Australia, when she was a 'special guest' at the Hillsong Conference in July 2005. It has since been replaced by a Gulfstream G-IV (serial number 1132)\nMeyer, who owns several homes and travels in a private jet (currently a Gulfstream G-IV),[7][8] has been criticized for living an excessive lifestyle. She doesn't defend her spending habits because \"... there's no need for us to apologize for being blessed.\"[7] Meyer commented, \"You can be a businessman here in St. Louis, and people think the more you have, the more wonderful it is ... but if you're a preacher, then all of a sudden it becomes a problem.\"[7]\nIn November 2003, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch published a four-part special report[7] detailing Meyer's \"$10 million corporate jet, her husband's $107,000 silver-gray Mercedes sedan, her $2 million home and houses worth another $2 million for her four children,\" a $20 million headquarters, furnished with \"$5.7 million worth of furniture, artwork, glassware, and the latest equipment and machinery,\" including a \"$30,000 malachite round table, a $23,000 marble-topped antique commode, a $14,000 custom office bookcase, a $7,000 Stations of the Cross in Dresden porcelain, a $6,300 eagle sculpture on a pedestal, another eagle made of silver bought for $5,000, and numerous paintings purchased for $1,000 to $4,000 each,\" among many other expensive items\u00a0\u2013 all paid for by the ministry. The articles prompted Wall Watchers[9] (a Christian nonprofit watchdog group) to call on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to investigate Meyer and her family.\nFollowing the adverse publicity about her lifestyle and Ministry Watch's request for an IRS probe, Meyer announced in 2004 plans to take a salary reduction from the $900,000 per year she had been receiving from Joyce Meyer Ministries (in addition to the $450,000 her husband received)[10] and instead personally keep more of the royalties from her outside book sales which Meyer had previously donated back to Joyce Meyer Ministries. She now retains royalties on books sold outside the ministry through retail outlets such as Walmart, Amazon.com, and bookstores, while continuing to donate to her ministry royalties from books sold through her conferences, catalogues, website, and television program.[11] \"The net effect of all of this,\" notes Ministry Watch,[9] \"was most likely a sizable increase in the personal compensation of Joyce Meyer and reduced revenues for JMM.\" In an article in the St. Louis Business Journal, Meyer's public relations director, Mark Sutherland, confirmed that her new income would be \"way above\" her previous levels.[12] Joyce Meyer Ministries says it has made a commitment to maintain transparency in financial dealings,[13]\npublish their annual reports,[13] have a Board majority who are not Meyer relatives[14] and submit to a voluntary annual audit.[13][15] On December 18, 2008, this ministry received a \"C\" grade (71\u201380 score) for financial transparency from Ministry Watch.[16]\nJoyce Meyer Ministries was one of six investigated by the United States Senate inquiry into the tax-exempt status of religious organizations[17][18][19] by Senator Chuck Grassley. The inquiry sought to determine if Meyer made any personal profit from financial donations, asking for a detailed accounting for such things as cosmetic surgery and foreign bank accounts and citing such expenses as the $23,000 commode mentioned earlier. Grassley also requested that Meyer's ministry make the information available by December 6, 2007. In her November 29 response to Grassley, Meyer notes that the commode is a chest of drawers. Meyer writes that it was part of a large lot of items totaling $262,000 that were needed to furnish the ministry's 150,000-square-foot (14,000\u00a0m2) headquarters purchased in 2001. She said the commode's price tag was an \"errant value\" assigned by the selling agent and apologized for \"not paying close attention to specific 'assigned values' placed on the pieces.\"[18] Joyce Meyer Ministries responded with a newsletter to its e-mail list subscribers on November 9, 2007. The organization referred to its annual financial reports, asserting that, in 2006, the ministry spent 82 percent of its total expenses \"for outreach and program services toward reaching people with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as attested by independent accounting firm Stanfield & O'Dell, LLP.\" The message also quoted an October 10, 2007, letter from the Internal Revenue Service which stated, \"We determined that you [Joyce Meyer Ministries] continue to qualify as an organization exempt from federal income tax under IRC section 501(c)(3).\" The same information was also posted to the ministry website. Joyce Meyer Ministries was one of two ministries to comply with the Senate's requests for financial records. It also made commitments to future financial transparency. Neither party was found to have committed any wrongdoing.[20]\n\nECFA accreditation[edit]\nIn 2009, Joyce Meyer Ministries received accreditation from the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA). In an announcement on March 12, 2009, the ECFA said that Joyce Meyer Ministries and Oral Roberts University had met their requirements of  \"'responsible stewardship', which involves ministries' financial accountability, transparency, board governance and fund-raising practices.\"[21]\n\n2011 wrongful death lawsuit[edit]\nOn May 5, 2009, Christopher Coleman, the chief of security of Joyce Meyer Ministries was arrested on suspicion of murder after police discovered the bodies of Coleman's wife, Sheri Coleman, and two sons at their residence, all three persons having died of apparent strangulation.[22][23] On May 10, 2011, after a lengthy trial, Christopher Coleman was found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to three life sentences. According to the prosecuting attorney Kris Reitz, the murders were committed as part of a premeditated plan to leave his wife for another woman with whom he had been having an affair. According to Reitz, Coleman was concerned that if his extra-marital affair were made public it would result in him losing his job at Joyce Meyer Ministries, remembering, at this point, King David's same reasons for killing Bathsheba's husband and not dirtying his name as an adulterer, before the theocratic nation of Israel; It also recalls the Brazilian case of Flordelis where murder was alleged as an alternative way to avoid getting divorced, which would risk losing charisma and name among evangelicals. [24] Meyer provided prerecorded testimony during Coleman's criminal trial.[25]  The case was featured in an episode of Forensic Files II on March 6, 2022, titled \"Words Matter\".\nThe family of Sheri Coleman filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Joyce Meyer Ministries citing that the deaths of the three be the result of Meyer's negligence as a counselor. According to the suit, Christopher Coleman had  anonymously sent several threatening letters to his family as a way to remove suspicion from himself for the murder. The suit also alleged that as counselor for both Christopher and Sheri Coleman, Meyer should have had reasonable suspicion that the letters were sent by Coleman and warned Sheri.[26] The suit was dismissed by Circuit Judge Richard Aguirre in 2013.[27]\n\nSelected bibliography[edit]\nBeauty for Ashes: Receiving Emotional Healing. 1994.

He writes for several newspapers, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal, and has been published in magazines such as The Atlantic and Time. Williams has worked as an editorial writer, an op-ed columnist, a White House correspondent, and a national correspondent. He is a registered Democrat.[1]\nWilliams is the author of Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954\u20131965 (1987),[3] a companion to the documentary series of the same name about the civil rights movement; Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary (2000), a biography of Thurgood Marshall, the first black American to serve on the Supreme Court; and Enough (2006), which was inspired by a Bill Cosby speech at an NAACP gala and deals with Williams' critique of black leaders in America.[4]  Williams has received an Emmy Award and critical praise for his television documentary work and he has won awards for investigative journalism and for his opinion columns. He has been at Fox News since 1997.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nWilliams was born in Col\u00f3n, Panama, on April 10, 1954, to Alma G\u00e9raldine and Rogelio L. Williams.[5] Williams' father was from Jamaica and his mother was from Panama. His family spoke English and Spanish.[6] In a 2018 op-ed, Williams stated he had legally emigrated from Panama to the United States aboard a banana boat with his mother and his two siblings when he was four years of age.[7] The family briefly lived in Pleasantville, New Jersey, before settling in Brooklyn, New York. Williams received a scholarship to attend Oakwood Friends School, a Quaker school in Poughkeepsie, New York.[5] While at Oakwood, he was elected \"student clerk\" for his senior year, was editor of the school newspaper, and played sports.[8][9] After graduating from Oakwood in 1972,[5] Williams attended Haverford College, graduating with a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1976.[10][11][12]\n\nCareer[edit]\nThe Washington Post[edit]\nWilliams wrote for The Washington Post for 23 years.[11]\nSome days after Williams wrote a column defending Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas against sworn testimony by Anita Hill charging sexual harassment by Thomas, it was revealed several female employees of the Post had filed sexual harassment charges against Williams.[13] The paper took disciplinary action against Williams and published an apology by him.[14] On November 2, 1991, Williams wrote: \"It pained me to learn during the investigation that I had offended some of you. I have said so repeatedly in the last few weeks, and repeat here: some of my verbal conduct was wrong, I now know that, and I extend my sincerest apology to those whom I offended.\"[15]\n\nNational Public Radio[edit]\nWilliams joined NPR in 2000 as host of the daily afternoon talk show Talk of the Nation.[10]  He then served as senior national correspondent for NPR.[16] In 2009, NPR's president and CEO Vivian Schiller requested Fox News stop identifying him as an NPR host after Williams commented on The O'Reilly Factor: \"Michelle Obama, you know, she's got this Stokely Carmichael in a designer dress thing going. If she starts talking...her instinct is to start with this blame America, you know, I'm the victim. If that stuff starts coming out, people will go bananas and she'll go from being the new Jackie O to being something of an albatross\".[17] NPR Ombudsman Alicia Shepard maintained that: \"Williams tends to speak one way on NPR and another on Fox.\"[17]\nNPR terminated his contract on Wednesday, October 20, 2010, two days after he made remarks on The O'Reilly Factor.[18] He had commented, \"Look, Bill, I'm not a bigot. You know the kind of books I've written about the civil rights movement in this country. But when I get on the plane, I got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb and I think, you know, they are identifying themselves first and foremost as Muslims, I get worried. I get nervous.\"[19]  According to NPR, the remarks were \"inconsistent with our editorial standards and practices, and undermined his credibility as a news analyst with NPR.\" As to the reason for the termination of Williams' contract, NPR's president and CEO Vivian Schiller offered the following comment: \"News analysts may not take personal public positions on controversial issues; doing so undermines their credibility as analysts...\"[20] On October 21, 2010, Schiller told an audience at the Atlanta Press Club that Williams' feelings about Muslims should be between him and \"his psychiatrist or his publicist\u2014take your pick.\"[21] Schiller later apologized stating, \"I spoke hastily and I apologize to Juan and others for my thoughtless remark.\"[21]\nSome observers have questioned whether NPR actually fired Williams for making the comments on Fox News, as opposed to making them in another forum.[22] William Saletan of Slate.com compared the Williams situation to that of Shirley Sherrod, saying that both Sherrod and Williams had their words taken out of context in a way that made them appear racist and led to the loss of their jobs, except that Williams was victimized by liberals, rather than conservatives as in Sherrod's case.[23]  Saletan said that while Williams' confessed fears of Muslims were \"unsettling\", the context was Williams' argument that such fears should not be used to curtail the rights of Muslims or anyone else, and that Williams consistently argued that Muslims in general should not be blamed for the terrorist activities of Muslim extremists.[23]  NPR has been criticized by Williams and others for practicing a double standard in the firing, compared to their not firing Cokie Roberts, Nina Totenberg and other NPR reporters and analysts for their opinionated statements.[24][25]\n\nFox News Channel[edit]\nWilliams has been a Fox News Contributor since 1997.[22]  He has appeared on Special Report with Bret Baier, FOX News Sunday with Chris Wallace and was a regular co-host of The Five, until announcing on 5 May 2021, that he would leave the New-York office to work in the D.C. office in order to spend more time with his family in D.C.. He also appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and occasionally served as a guest host in O'Reilly's absence.[26] After NPR announced his termination from their network in October 2010, Fox News offered him a new $2 million (a \"considerable\" raise[27]) three-year contract and an expanded role at their network that included a regular guest-host role Friday nights on The O'Reilly Factor.[28]\nFollowing his firing from NPR, Williams appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and discussed his thoughts on how his role at Fox played into NPR's decision: \"I don't fit in their box. I'm not a predictable black liberal. You [O'Reilly] were exactly right when you said you know what this comes down to. They were looking for a reason to get rid of me because I'm appearing on Fox News. They don't want me talking to you.\"[28] On December 9, 2016, on Fox Business Channel, Stuart Varney asked Williams, \"Do you see yourself ever joining the Republican Party?\" Williams answered, \"I have two sons in the Republican Party, so, yes.\"[29]\n\nTelevision[edit]\nWilliams is the recipient of an Emmy Award for his work in television documentary writing and has earned critical praise for a series of television documentaries including Politics: The New Black Power, A. Philip Randolph: For Jobs and Freedom, Civil Rights and The Press, Riot to Recovery and Dying for Healthcare.[26]\nWilliams' 1988 book, Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954\u201365, was written with the Blackside production team[30] as a companion to the first season of the PBS series Eyes on the Prize. His 2003 book, This Far by Faith, is also a companion to a PBS series.[31]\nWilliams is a contributor to a number of national magazines, including Fortune, The New Republic, The Atlantic Monthly, Ebony magazine, TIME and GQ and frequents a wide range of television programs including ABC's Nightline, Washington Week on PBS, and The Oprah Winfrey Show.[26]\nWilliams has spoken at the Smithsonian's celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision, which ended legal segregation in public schools, and was selected by the United States Census Bureau as moderator of its first program beginning its 2010 effort. He has received honorary doctorates from Lafayette College, Wittenberg University, and Long Island University, among other institutions.[32][33][34]\n\nCriticism[edit]\nIn October 1991 Williams was accused of sexual harassment by four female Washington Post colleagues.[35][36] His colleagues recalled him making sexually suggestive comments about them.[37] William published an article apologizing for his comments.[35]\nA February 2013 column written by Williams for The Hill was found to contain content that had been plagiarized. Williams asserted that a researcher was responsible for the plagiarism and that he himself had been unaware of it.[11]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nWilliams married Susan Delise in July 1978.  They are the parents of one daughter, Rae, and two sons, Antonio (\"Tony\") and Raphael (\"Raffi\").[38]  Tony, who was a Senate page and intern for GOP Senator Strom Thurmond from 1996 to 1997, was a speechwriter and legislative correspondent for Republican Senator Norm Coleman from 2004 to 2006; in 2006, Tony ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the Council of the District of Columbia, losing to Tommy Wells.  The younger son, Raffi, studied anthropology and played lacrosse at Haverford College, his father's alma mater in Pennsylvania.  He has worked for the House Rules Committee and as the communications director for Michigan Republican Dan Benishek's successful 2012 congressional campaign,[39] and was a deputy press secretary for the Republican National Committee.[40] Raffi served as press secretary to former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson.[41]\nWilliams is the grandfather of twin girls, Pepper and Wesley.[42]\nWilliams has described himself as \"a black guy with a Hispanic name\", and identifies as Afro-Panamanian.[43][44]\nWilliams has been active on the Haverford College Board of Managers, in the Aspen Institute Communications and Society Program, and in the Washington Journalism Center. He sits on the board of directors of the New York Civil Rights Coalition.[10][45]\n\nAwards[edit]\nWilliams has received many awards, including honorary doctorates from Haverford College and State University of New York.[46]\n\nSee also[edit]\nNew Yorkers in journalism\nSelected bibliography[edit]\nExternal videos Interview with Williams on Eyes on the Prize, February 3, 1987, C-SPAN Presentation by Williams on Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary, July 14, 1998, C-SPAN Booknotes interview with Williams on Thurgood Marshall, October 11, 1998, C-SPAN Discussion with Williams on Thurgood Marshall, June 3, 1999, C-SPAN Presentation by Williams on This Far by Faith, October 4, 2003, C-SPAN Presentation by Williams on My Soul Looks Back in Wonder, October 9, 2004, C-SPAN After Words interview with Williams on Enough, August 12, 2006, C-SPAN Book party for Muzzled, July 19, 2011, C-SPAN Q&A interview with Williams on Muzzled, July 31, 2011, C-SPAN Interview with Williams on Muzzled, October 22, 2011, C-SPAN Washington Journal interview with Williams on We the People, April 17, 2016, C-SPAN Presentation by Williams on We the People, May 21, 2016, C-SPAN Washington Journal interview with Williams on What the Hell Do You Have to Lose?, October 1, 2018, C-SPAN Presentation by Williams on What the Hell Do You Have to Lose?, October 5, 2018, C-SPAN Washington Journal interview with Williams on What the Hell Do You Have to Lose?, December 25, 2018, C-SPAN\nEyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954\u20131965.
