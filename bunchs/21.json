For the Irish actress, see Joan Brosnan Walsh.\nJoan WalshWalsh at Social Media Weekend 2018Born (1958-09-18) September 18, 1958 (age\u00a065)Brooklyn, New YorkNationalityAmericanEducationUniversity of Wisconsin (BA)OccupationJournalistChildrenNora Walsh DeVries\nJoan Maureen Walsh (born September 18, 1958) is a liberal American political pundit and journalist. Walsh is national affairs correspondent for The Nation, and was previously an on-air political analyst at CNN and MSNBC. She produced the 2020 documentary \"The Sit In: Harry Belafonte Hosts The Tonight Show.\" She is a former editor-in-chief of Salon and author of the book What's the Matter with White People?[1]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nWalsh was born in Brooklyn, New York[2] to an Irish Catholic family.[3] In 1960, her family moved to Oceanside, Long Island.[2] She has one brother and one sister. At the age of 13, her family moved to a northern suburb of Milwaukee where she attended high school.[4] Her mother died when she was 17.[4]\nWalsh is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin, where she wrote for The Daily Cardinal.[4][5]\n\nMedia career[edit]\nPrint media[edit]\nWhen the online magazine Salon launched in 1998, Walsh became its first news editor.[6] She was editor-in-chief from 2005 to 2010.[7] In 2015, she left Salon for The Nation, and would become the publication's national affairs correspondent.\n\nTV career[edit]\nWalsh worked at MSNBC for a total of twelve years, six of them under contract. On December 23, 2017, Walsh said MSNBC had chosen not to renew her contract, which the network described as a decision made because of an annual review. In their statement, MSNBC also said that \"Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t renew Joan, but she and her distinct perspective will still be invited on our shows.\"[8]\nMSNBC's decision to not renew Walsh's contract prompted critical reactions from other MSNBC personalities, including Joy Reid and Chris Hayes. Some of Walsh's supporters also protested MSNBC's decision using the Twitter hashtag #KeepJoanWalsh.[9]\nLater that day, Walsh tweeted that she would move to CNN in 2018, which was soon confirmed by a CNN spokeswoman.[10][1] While at CNN, Walsh pushed back against former Donald Trump staffer Marc Short for accusing her of being anti-religious.[11]\n\nIt was announced on December 14, 2020, that her contract with CNN would not be renewed. Walsh stated in response:\u201cI\u2019m grateful to CNN for the opportunity. Nobody is promised a decade of paid TV commentary. Arguably, nobody deserves it! I am certainly willing to contribute to my friends\u2019 shows on MSNBC and on CNN too when I\u2019m right for the topic.\u201d[12]\nSocial media activity[edit]\nOn April 1, 2018, Kyle Kashuv, a witness of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, tweeted that Walsh \"liked\" a tweet criticizing him. She replied, \"Are you really policing who 'likes' tweets from a grieving Parkland father who lost his daughter? Good luck handling your stress, Kyle.\"[13]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nWalsh is divorced and has one daughter,[14] Nora Walsh DeVries.[15][16]\n\nBooks[edit]\n(with C. W. Nevius) Splash Hit!

He hosts The Joe Rogan Experience, a podcast in which he discusses current events, comedy, politics, philosophy, science, martial arts, and hobbies with a variety of guests.\nRogan was born in Newark, New Jersey, and began his career in comedy in 1988 in the Boston area. After relocating to Los Angeles in 1994, he signed an exclusive developmental deal with Disney and appeared as an actor on several television shows, including Hardball and NewsRadio. In 1997, he started working for the UFC as an interviewer and color commentator. He released his first comedy special, I'm Gonna Be Dead Someday..., in 2000 and hosted the game show Fear Factor from 2001 to 2006.\nAfter leaving Fear Factor, Rogan focused on his stand-up career and hosted more comedy specials. He launched The Joe Rogan Experience in 2009; by 2015, it was one of the most popular podcasts in the world, regularly receiving millions of plays per episode. Spotify obtained exclusive distribution rights to The Joe Rogan Experience in 2020 for US$200\u00a0million.[2] Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, the podcast has received criticism for spreading conspiracy theories and health misinformation.\n\n\nEarly life\nRogan in a 1985 yearbook\nJoseph James Rogan was born in Newark, New Jersey, on August 11, 1967.[3][4] He had one Irish grandparent, while his three other grandparents were all of Italian descent.[5] His parents divorced when he was five,[6] and he has not been in contact with his father since he was seven. He recalled, \"All I remember of my dad are these brief, violent flashes of domestic violence. But I don't want to complain about my childhood. Nothing bad ever really happened to me. I don't hate the guy.\"[6] At the age of seven, he moved with his mother to San Francisco, California.[6] When he was 11, they moved to Gainesville, Florida.[7] They later settled in Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts, where he graduated from Newton South High School in 1985.[8][9][10]\nRogan participated in Little League Baseball and developed an interest in martial arts in his early teens.[11] He recalled being \"terrified of being a loser\" as a child[12] and said, \"Martial arts gave me not just confidence, but also a different perspective of myself and what I was capable of. I knew that I could do something I was terrified of, and that was really difficult, and that I could excel at it. It was a big deal for me.\"[12] Martial arts were \"the first thing that ever gave me hope that I wasn't going to be a loser. So I really, really gravitated toward it.\"[13] At age 14, he took up karate and started taekwondo a year later.[6] When he was 19, he won the US Open Championship taekwondo tournament as a lightweight.[4][10] He was a Massachusetts full-contact state champion for four consecutive years and became a taekwondo instructor.[4][6] He also practiced amateur kickboxing and held a 2\u20131 record;[14] he retired from competition at age 21, as he began to suffer from frequent headaches and feared he might sustain worse injuries.[4][6] He attended the University of Massachusetts Boston but found it pointless and dropped out early.[6]\n\nCareer\n1988\u20131994: Early stand-up career\n\n\nI didn't have a direction until I became a stand-up comedian. I was pretty nervous about my future. I couldn't imagine myself working a 9-to-5 job.\n\n\n\u2014Rogan on his career[15]\n\n\nRogan had no intention of being a professional comedian,[16][17] but was a fan of comedy from a young age, later saying of Richard Pryor's special Live on the Sunset Strip, \"It affected me in such a profound way. Nothing had made me laugh like that.\"[4] His friends from gym and Taekwondo school, whom he would make laugh with impressions and jokes, convinced him to try stand-up.[4] At 21, after six months preparing material and practicing his delivery,[18] he performed his first stand-up routine on August 27, 1988, at an open-mic night at a Stitches comedy club in Boston.[8][16]\nWhile living in Boston and working on his stand-up, Rogan held several jobs to secure himself financially, including teaching martial arts at Boston University and in nearby Revere, delivering newspapers, driving a limousine, doing construction work, and assisting a private investigator.[6][8] Meanwhile, his blue comedy style earned him gigs at bachelor parties and strip clubs.[4] One night, he persuaded the owner of a comedy club in Boston to allow him to try a new five-minute routine. At the show was talent manager Jeff Sussman, who liked the act and offered to become his manager, which Rogan accepted.[4][19]\nIn 1990, Rogan moved to New York City. As a full-time comedian, he was \"scratching and grinding\" for money and stayed with his grandfather in Newark for the first six months.[20] Rogan later cited Richard Jeni,[21] Lenny Bruce,[22] Sam Kinison and Bill Hicks as comedy influences.[16]\n\n1994\u20131999: Hardball and NewsRadio\nIn 1994, Rogan relocated to Los Angeles,[6] where his first national television spot followed on the MTV comedy show Half-Hour Comedy Hour.[4] The appearance led to the network offering him a three-year exclusive contract and a role in a pilot episode of a \"dopey game show\" for $500. Rogan declined, but it prompted Sussman to send tapes of Rogan's performances to several networks, which sparked a bidding war.[16] After a period of negotiation, Rogan accepted a development deal with the Disney network. He secured his first major acting role in the 1994 nine-episode Fox sitcom Hardball as Frank Valente, a young, egocentric star player on a professional baseball team.[16] Rogan called the hiring process \"weird\", as the network had no idea if he could act until he was asked by Dean Valentine, then-president of Walt Disney Television, to whom he replied: \"If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure.\"[16] The filming schedule was a new experience for Rogan, who started to work 12-hour days.[11] Rogan later said: \"It was a great show on paper until a horrible executive producer with a big ego was hired by Fox to run the show and he rewrote it.\"[16] Around this time, Rogan began performing at The Comedy Store in Hollywood and was hired as a paid regular by owner Mitzi Shore. According to Rogan, he performed at the club for the next 13 years for free and paid for the venue's new sound system.[23]\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Rogan starred in the NBC sitcom NewsRadio as Joe Garrelli, an electrician and handyman at the show's fictional news radio station.[4][24] The role was originally set to be played by actor Ray Romano, but Romano was let go from the cast after one rehearsal and Rogan was brought in.[16][25] The switch caused Rogan to work with the show's writers to help develop the character before the show was set to launch,[26] which he later described as a \"very dumbed-down, censored version\" of himself.[19] Rogan befriended fellow cast member Phil Hartman, who confided his marital problems to him. Rogan claimed he tried to persuade Hartman to divorce his wife five times, but \"he loved his kids and didn't want to leave.\" In 1998, Hartman was murdered by his wife.[27] The loss affected Rogan's ability to perform stand-up, and he canceled a week of scheduled gigs.[28] Rogan later saw acting as an easy job, but grew tired of \"playing the same character every week\",[29] and only did so for the money.[30] He later viewed his time on NewsRadio as \"a dream gig\" that allowed him to earn money while working on his stand-up as often as he could.[16][8] During the series, he worked on a pilot for a show entitled Overseas.[29]\n\n1997\u20132006: UFC commentator and Fear Factor\nRogan (right) posing with Gerald Strebendt in a boxing ring, 2002\nRogan began working for the mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship as a backstage and post-fight interviewer. His first show took place at UFC 12: Judgement Day in Dothan, Alabama, on February 7, 1997.[31] He became interested in Brazilian jiu-jitsu in 1994 after watching Royce Gracie fight at UFC 2: No Way Out, and landed the position at the organization as Sussman was friends with its co-creator and original producer, Campbell McLaren.[32] He quit after two years as his salary could not cover the cost of traveling to the events, which were often held in rural locations.[33]\nAfter the UFC was taken over by Zuffa in 2001, Rogan attended some events and became friends with its new president Dana White, who offered him a job as a color commentator. However, Rogan initially declined as he \"just wanted to go to the fights and drink\".[32][6] In 2002, White was able to hire Rogan for free in exchange for prime event tickets for him and his friends.[31] After about 15 free gigs as a commentator, Rogan accepted pay for the job, working alongside Mike Goldberg until the end of 2016.[6] Rogan won the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Award for Best Television Announcer twice, and was named MMA Personality of the Year four times by the World MMA Awards.[34]\nIn 1999, Rogan secured a three-album deal with Warner Bros. Records and began tentative plans to star in his own prime-time televised sitcom on Fox named The Joe Rogan Show.[17] The show, co-written by Seinfeld writer Bill Masters, was to feature Rogan as \"a second-string sportscaster who lands a spot as the token male on a View-style women's show\".[19] In December 1999, he recorded his first stand-up comedy album in two shows at the Comedy Connection at Faneuil Hall in Boston,[35] which was released as I'm Gonna Be Dead Some Day... in August 2000.[4][16] It received national exposure on The Howard Stern Show and downloads from Napster.[36] \"Voodoo Punanny\", a song Rogan wrote after Warner suggested to produce a song they could play on the radio, was subsequently released as a single.[37] Around this time, Rogan also worked on ideas for a film and a cartoon with his comedian friend Chris McGuire,[29][16] and began to operate a blog on his website, JoeRogan.net, which he used to discuss various topics that helped him develop his stand-up routines.[30]\nIn 2001, the development of Rogan's television show was interrupted after he accepted an offer from NBC to host the American edition of Fear Factor. He declined initially as he thought the network would not air such a program due to its content, but Sussman convinced him to accept.[4] Rogan later said that the main reason he accepted was to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy.[38] The show increased Rogan's national exposure which caused turnouts at his stand-up gigs to grow. Fear Factor ran for an initial six seasons from 2001 to 2006.[39]\nRogan's role as host of Fear Factor led to further television opportunities. In 2002, he appeared on the episode \"A Beautiful Mind\" of Just Shoot Me as Chris, the boyfriend of lead character Maya Gallo.[40] In December 2002, Rogan was the emcee for the 2002 Blockbuster Hollywood Spectacular, a Christmas parade in Hollywood.[41] In February 2003, Rogan became the new co-host of The Man Show on Comedy Central for its fifth season from August 2003, with fellow comedian Doug Stanhope, following the departure of original hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla.[42][43] A year into the show, however, the hosts entered disagreements with Comedy Central and the show's producers over content. Rogan recalled: \"I was a little misled ... I was told: 'Show nudity, and we'll blur it out. Swear and we'll bleep it out.' That hasn't been the case\".[44] The show ended in 2004. Around this time Rogan entered talks to host his own radio show, but they came to nothing due to his already busy schedule.[44]\n\n2005\u20132009: Comedy specials\nRogan commentating for the UFC in 2006\nIn 2005, actor Wesley Snipes challenged Rogan to a cage fight. Rogan trained for the event for five months before Snipes backed out following an investigation by the IRS for alleged tax evasion. Rogan believed Snipes needed a quick payout to alleviate his debt.[45]\nAfter Fear Factor, Rogan focused his career on his stand-up comedy, as concentrating on television had made him feel lazy and uninspired to work on new material for his act. With the money he had earned from television, Rogan hired two people full-time to film him and his comedy friends on tour, and release clips on his website for his JoeShow web series.[46] In May 2005, Rogan signed a deal with the Endeavor Talent Agency.[47] Two months later, he filmed his second stand-up comedy special, Joe Rogan: Live, in Phoenix, Arizona. The special premiered on Showtime in 2007.[48][49]\nIn 2005, Rogan wrote a blog entry on his website accusing comedian Carlos Mencia of joke thievery, a claim he had made since 1993.[18][50][51] The situation culminated in February 2007 when Rogan confronted Mencia on stage at The Comedy Store in Hollywood.[52] A video of the incident was uploaded onto YouTube and included evidence and comments from other comedians, including George Lopez, \"The Reverend\" Bob Levy, Bobby Lee, and Ari Shaffir.[53] The incident led to Rogan's talent agent expelling him as a client of The Gersh Agency, who also managed Mencia, and his ban from The Comedy Store, causing him to relocate his regular venue to the Hollywood Improv Comedy Club. Rogan later said that every comic he had talked to was happy and thankful that he did it,[48] and went on to sign with William Morris Agency.[23]\nIn April 2007, Comedy Central Records released Rogan's fourth comedy special, Shiny Happy Jihad.[48] The set was recorded in September 2006 at Cobb's Comedy Club in San Francisco, and contains excerpts of an improvized Q&A session with the audience that was typical of Rogan's act at the time.[54][32]\n\n2009\u2013present: Latest endeavors and podcast\nRogan performing stand-up in 2011\nRogan hosted the short-lived CBS show Game Show in My Head, which aired for eight episodes in January 2009. It was produced by Ashton Kutcher.[31] The show involved contestants who try to convince people to perform or take part in increasingly bizarre situations for money. He agreed to host the show as the idea intrigued him, calling it \"a completely mindless form of entertainment\".[15]\nIn 2010, Rogan accused comedian Dane Cook of joke thievery.[51]\nIn 2011, Rogan resumed his role as Fear Factor host for its seventh and final season (until 2012).[39] Rogan took the job, saying he \"would hate to see somebody else do it.\"[55] Later in 2011, Rogan played his first major film character, Gale, in the comedy film Zookeeper.[56] He was also working on a book around this time that he tentatively titled Irresponsible Advice from a Man with No Credibility, based on his blog entries on his website.[13] Rogan played himself in Here Comes the Boom, another action-comedy film starring Kevin James that was released in 2012.[57]\nIn December 2012, Rogan released his sixth comedy special Live from the Tabernacle exclusively as a download on his website for $5, following Louis C.K.'s example.[58]\nIn 2013, Rogan hosted the television show Joe Rogan Questions Everything on the SyFy network, which aired for six episodes. The show covered topics discussed on his podcasts, including the existence of Bigfoot and UFOs, and featured several comedians, experts, and scientists with the aim of trying to \"put some subjects to bed\u00a0... with an open-minded perspective\".[58] SyFy agreed to produce the show without a pilot episode. The production team gave Rogan some creative control over the program and aimed to present it in his own words where possible.[59]\n\nThe Joe Rogan Experience\nMain article: The Joe Rogan Experience\nIn December 2009, Rogan launched a free podcast with his friend and fellow comedian Brian Redban.[6][60] The first episode was recorded on December 24 and was to be a live weekly broadcast on Ustream,[61] with Rogan and Redban \"sitting in front of laptops bullshitting\".[13] By August 2010, the podcast was named The Joe Rogan Experience and entered the list of Top 100 podcasts on iTunes,[62] and in 2011, was picked up by SiriusXM Satellite Radio.[13] The podcast features an array of guests who discuss current events, politics, philosophy, comedy, hobbies and numerous other topics.[63] In January 2015, the podcast was downloaded over 11 million times.[64] By October that year, the podcast was downloaded 16 million times each month, making it one of the most popular free podcasts.[6]\nOn May 19, 2020, Rogan announced that he had signed a multi-year licensing deal with Spotify worth an estimated $200\u00a0million, making it one of the largest licensing agreements in the podcast business.[65][66] The deal made The Joe Rogan Experience available on Spotify starting September 1, 2020, and exclusive on the platform from January 2021. The podcast is available with both audio and video within the Spotify app and video is no longer streamed or uploaded to YouTube. The podcasts are typically released one day after recording, to allow time for the producers to make clips of the podcast. Clips from the video version will continue to be available on YouTube.[67][65] In February 2022, Spotify removed 113 episodes of The Joe Rogan Experience over the course of a few days owing in part to some of the episodes having been perceived to have racist and insensitive language.[68][69][70]\nIn February 2022, singer India Arie shared a compilation of Rogan saying the racial slur \"nigger\" on The Joe Rogan Experience on Instagram.[71] Rogan apologized, calling his past language \"regretful and shameful\" while also saying that the clips were taken out of context and that he only quoted the slur to discuss its use by others.[72][73][74] The footage in question was first published by the political action committee PatriotTakes, an affiliate of the liberal PAC MeidasTouch. This resulted in allegations of a defamation attempt by MeidasTouch, which the founders denied in an interview with Barstool Sports founder David Portnoy, instead attributing the source of the footage to Alex Jones who was a recurring guest on Rogan's show.[75] Rogan described the video compilation as a \"political hit job\".[76][77][78] A number of UFC fighters, including Israel Adesanya, Terrance McKinney, Michael Chandler, Aljamain Sterling, Frankie Edgar, Darren Till, Marlon Vera, Ben Askren, and Brendan Schaub, defended Rogan.[79]\nSpotify had refused to carry 42 episodes of the podcast when it acquired the exclusive rights.[80] Spotify says it spoke to Rogan about his \"history of using some racially insensitive language\", and it says (in an internal memo) that Rogan selected 70 episodes[81] which were removed on February 4, 2022,[80] all of which pre-date the COVID-19 pandemic.[82]\nIn early 2022, the video platform Rumble offered Rogan $100\u00a0million to switch from Spotify.[83] Variety reported that Rogan had declined the offer.[84]\n\nOnnit\nRogan is a co-founder of the supplements and fitness company Onnit, which was sold to Unilever in 2021.[85] Rogan frequently advertises for Onnit products on his podcast.[86]\n\nComedy Mothership\nRogan is also the owner of the Comedy Mothership comedy club in Austin, Texas.[87]\n\nPersonal life\nRogan married Jessica Ditzel, a former cocktail waitress, in 2009.[6][88] They have two daughters, who were born in 2008 and 2010. Rogan is also the stepfather or adopted father of Ditzel's daughter from a previous relationship.[89][1] In 2008, they moved to Gold Hill, Colorado, but returned to Southern California four months later when Ditzel became pregnant.[90] They settled in Bell Canyon, California, where Rogan had lived on and off since 2003. In 2018, they purchased a new home in the area for almost $5\u00a0million.[91][92][93][94] In 2020, the family moved into a $14\u00a0million home on Lake Austin in Austin, Texas.[95]\nRogan became interested in jiu-jitsu after watching Royce Gracie fight at UFC 2: No Way Out in 1994.[33] In 1996, he began training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Carlson Gracie at his school in Hollywood, California.[14] He is a black belt under Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu, a style of no-gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu,[96] and a black belt in gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Jean Jacques Machado.[97]\nRogan has vitiligo on his hands and feet.[6] He was raised Catholic, having attended Catholic school in first grade, but has since abandoned organized religion and has called himself an agnostic.[98] In October 2019, he revealed that he is a first cousin once removed of My Chemical Romance members Gerard Way and Mikey Way, although he has never met them.[99]\n\nViews\nPolitical positions\nIn 2020, CNN described Rogan as \"libertarian-leaning\".[100] Rogan has said that he holds a wide variety of political views and does not easily fall on any particular side of the political spectrum.[101] He has described himself as socially liberal, saying that he supports same-sex marriage, gay rights, women's rights, recreational drug use, universal health care, and universal basic income, but also supports gun rights and the Second Amendment.[102][103] Rogan describes himself as a strong supporter of freedom of speech, and has criticized cancel culture and what he perceives to be suppression of those who hold right-wing views in the television and film industry.[101] He has also criticized what he describes as an American foreign policy of military adventurism.[104]\nRogan endorsed Ron Paul in the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign[105] and voted for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[106] He endorsed Bernie Sanders during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries,[100] but ended up voting for Jo Jorgensen in the general election.[107]\nRogan has said that Florida governor Ron DeSantis would be \"a good president\", adding that \"what he's done for Florida has been admirable.\"[108] Rogan opposes Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, calling him \"a fucking dictator\" and called Canada \"communist\" while admitting that he has \"zero understanding\" of Canada's political system. Rogan also said that he liked Trudeau prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.[109] Rogan also called Russian President Vladimir Putin \"evil\".[110]\n\n2020 presidential election\nRogan publicly supported Tulsi Gabbard and encouraged her to run for the U.S. presidency in 2020.[111] On January 21, 2020, Rogan said he would \"probably\" vote for Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic primary, adding, \"He's been insanely consistent his entire life.\"[112] Sanders was criticized by fellow Democrats for touting Rogan's endorsement during the 2020 presidential campaign, including by MoveOn, which referred to Rogan as \"someone known for promoting transphobia, homophobia, Islamophobia, racism and misogyny\". The Human Rights Campaign called on Sanders to reject Rogan's endorsement.[100]\nAfter Sanders dropped out of the race, Rogan said he would \"rather vote for Trump than Biden\" adding that \"I don't think [Biden] can handle anything.\" He claimed that he was concerned that Biden, who turned 78 shortly after Election Day, lacked the cognitive ability needed to run the United States and would not be able to handle the pressure of the presidency. Rogan criticized Biden for his verbal slip-ups, which he described as \"not a normal way to communicate, unless you're high\".[113] He also said \"Biden, to me, is like having a flashlight with a dying battery and going for a long hike in the woods, it is not going to work out. It's not going to make it.\"[114] Donald Trump subsequently retweeted Rogan's comments on Biden's mental fitness.[115]\nRogan offered to moderate a four-hour debate with Trump and Biden in an effort to avoid what he referred to as media bias; Trump said he would be willing to do such a debate.[116] A Change.org petition was started \"to elect Joe Rogan as the moderator for the 2020 Presidential Debate\", claiming that Rogan was qualified to handle the debates because he is nonpartisan. The petition received over 300,000 signatures.[117]\nRogan later revealed during a live election night podcast that he voted for Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen.[118]\n\n2022 midterm elections\nRogan urged his followers and those who were angry over COVID-19 safety protocols to \"vote Republican\" in an episode of his podcast centered around lessons learned during the pandemic. He also praised Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, stating that his response to the pandemic was \"open and reasonable\".[119]\n\nDrugs and spirituality\nRogan supports the legalized use of cannabis and believes it holds numerous benefits.[120][121] He hosted the documentary film The Union: The Business Behind Getting High and was featured in Marijuana: A Chronic History and The Culture High. He also supports the use of LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and DMT toward the exploration and enhancement of consciousness, as well as introspection. He was the presenter in the 2010 documentary DMT: The Spirit Molecule.[122]\nRogan has an interest in sensory deprivation and using an isolation tank. He has stated that his personal experiences with meditation in isolation tanks have helped him explore the nature of consciousness and improve his performance in various physical and mental activities and overall well-being.[123]\n\nCOVID-19 and vaccines\nFurther information: COVID-19 misinformation and Ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic\nIn April 2021, Rogan made contentious remarks about COVID-19 vaccines, in particular claiming that young, healthy people do not need to be vaccinated against the virus.[124][125] This view was criticized by Anthony Fauci and White House communication director Kate Bedingfield, as well as by several media outlets.[126][127][128][129] Part of the objection was that there have been notable cases affecting young, healthy people.[125] Rogan acknowledged there was \"some legitimate science\" behind Fauci's view and emphasized that he is not a doctor and should not be taken as \"a respected source of information\".[130][131]\nOn September 1, 2021, Rogan tested positive for the virus.[132] Soon after, he released an online video reporting on the status of his condition and stating that he had begun a regimen including monoclonal antibodies, prednisone, azithromycin, NAD drip, a vitamin drip, as well as ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug that is not an effective treatment for COVID-19.[133][134][135] This drew controversy due to multiple people reportedly being hospitalized after self-medicating with an over-the-counter form of ivermectin designed to treat ailments in livestock, which typically has a significantly larger dosage.[132] Rogan criticized CNN for describing ivermectin as a \"horse dewormer\".[136] On Rogan's podcast, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta said that ivermectin is used to treat diseases caused by parasites but that CNN should not have implied that Rogan was taking a veterinary drug since Rogan acquired it through a doctor.[137] On September 3, 2021, Rogan tested negative for the virus.[138]\nIn January 2022, 270 scientists, physicians, professors, doctors, and healthcare workers wrote an open letter to Spotify expressing concern over \"false and societally harmful assertions\" on The Joe Rogan Experience and asked Spotify to \"establish a clear and public policy to moderate misinformation on its platform.\" The 270 signatories took issue with Rogan \"broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic\" and more specifically \"a highly controversial episode\" featuring guest Robert W. Malone (#1757)\", a biochemist who has promoted vaccine misinformation.[139][140]\nThe episode was criticized for promoting conspiracy theories, including \"an unfounded theory that societal leaders have 'hypnotized' the public\". The signatories wrote that \"Dr. Malone is one of two recent JRE guests who has compared pandemic policies to the Holocaust. These actions are not only objectionable and offensive, but also medically and culturally dangerous.\" The signatories also note that Malone was suspended from Twitter \"for spreading misinformation about COVID-19\".[139][140]\nOn January 24, 2022, the songwriter Neil Young posted an open letter demanding that Spotify remove his music from their service if they would not remove The Joe Rogan Experience from their service. Young wrote that \"Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform\".[141] On January 26, Spotify removed Young's music; a spokesperson said Spotify wanted \"all the world's music and audio content to be available to Spotify users\" and that it had a \"great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators\".[141] On January 29, the songwriter Joni Mitchell removed her catalog from Spotify in support of Young and \"the global scientific and medical communities on this issue\".[142][143]\nResponding to the controversy, Rogan denied intentionally spreading misinformation and pledged \"to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people's perspectives\", and said that he agreed with Spotify adding a disclaimer to the beginning of his videos.[144]\n\nOther views and advocacy\nRogan is an avid hunter and is part of the \"Eat What You Kill\" movement, which attempts to move away from factory farming and the mistreatment of animals raised for food.[145]\nRogan has been an outspoken critic of transgender women competing in women's sports, including MMA matches.[100] In April 2022, he said that transgender swimmer Lia Thomas \"might be the woke straw that breaks society's camel's back\".[146] In October 2022, while interviewing Tulsi Gabbard on his show, Rogan shared the widely discredited litter boxes in schools hoax, claiming that public schools were providing litter boxes to students who dress up as cats.[147][148] Rogan said several weeks later that \"it doesn't seem that there's any proof that they put a litter box in there\", but falsely claimed that there were discussions considering the idea.[149]\nDuring an episode of his podcast in February 2023, Rogan stated the \"idea that Jewish people are not into money is ridiculous. That's like saying Italians aren't into pizza. It's fucking stupid.\"[150] Rogan made the comment in defense of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who faced allegations of antisemitism for saying that political support for Israel was \"all about the benjamins.\"[150] Jonathan Greenblatt, the Director of the Anti-Defamation League, condemned Rogan's comment as reflecting \"antisemitic tropes about Jews and money.\"[150]\n\nFilmography and discography\nTelevision\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nRole\nNotes\n\n\n1994\nHardball\nFrank Valente\n\n\n\n1995\u20131999\nNewsRadio\nJoe Garrelli\n\n\n\n1996\nMADtv\nHimself, guest appearance\nSeason 2, Episode 7\n\n\n1997\nBruce Testones, Fashion Photographer\nWriter, himself\n\n\n\n1997\u2013present\nUltimate Fighting Championship\nInterviewer (1997\u20132002)Color commentator (2002\u2013present)\n\n\n\n2001\u20132002\nLate Friday\nHost\n\n\n\n2001-2003\n\nHoward Stern\n\nGuest\n\n\n\n\n2001\u20132006  2011\u20132012\nFear Factor\nHost\n\n\n\n2002\nJust Shoot Me!\nChris\n\"A Beautiful Mind\"\n\n\n2003\nGood Morning, Miami\nHimself\nSeason 1, Episode 17: \"Fear and Loathing in Miami\"\n\n\n2003\u20132004\nThe Man Show\nHimself\nHost\n\n\n2003\u20132004\nChappelle's Show\nHimself\nSeason 1, Episode 4Season 2, Episode 12\n\n\n2003\u20132007\nLast Comic Standing\nCelebrity talent scout\n\n\n\n2005\u20132008\nThe Ultimate Fighter\nAnnouncer\n\n\n\n2006\nInside the UFC\nHost\n\n\n\n2007\u20132009\nUFC Wired\nHost\n\n\n\n2009\nGame Show in My Head\nHost\n\n\n\n2012\u20132013\nUFC Ultimate Insider\nHimself\n\n\n\n2013\nJoe Rogan Questions Everything\nHost\n\n\n\n2015\nSilicon Valley\nHimself\nSeason 2, Episode 6: \"Homicide\"\n\nFeature films and documentaries\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nRole\n\n\n2002\nIt's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie\nHimself, cameo\n\n\n2007\nThe Union: The Business Behind Getting High\nHimself\n\n\n2007\nAmerican Drug War: The Last White Hope\nHimself\n\n\n2010\nDMT: The Spirit Molecule\nHimself\n\n\n2010\nVenus & Vegas\nRichie\n\n\n2011\nZookeeper\nGale\n\n\n2012\nHere Comes the Boom\nHimself\n\n\n2017\nBright\nHimself\n\nComedy specials\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nFormat\n\n\n2000\nI'm Gonna Be Dead Someday ... \nCD\n\n\n2000\n\"Voodoo Punanny\"\nCD single\n\n\n2001\nLive from the Belly of the Beast\nDVD\n\n\n2006\nJoe Rogan: Live\nDVD\n\n\n2007\nShiny Happy Jihad\nCD\n\n\n2010\nTalking Monkeys in Space\nCD, DVD\n\n\n2012\nLive from the Tabernacle\nOnline\n\n\n2014\nRocky Mountain High\nComedy Central special, online\n\n\n2016\nTriggered\nNetflix[151]\n\n\n2018\nStrange Times\nNetflix\n\nVideo games\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nRole\n\n\n2014\nEA Sports UFC\nHimself\n\n\n2016\nEA Sports UFC 2\nHimself\n\n\n2018\nEA Sports UFC 3\nHimself\n\nPublications\nForeword to Endure: How to Work Hard, Outlast, and Keep Hammering, by Cameron Hanes, with an afterword by David Goggins.

Known for his weekly televised services and several best-selling books, Osteen is one of the more prominent figures associated with prosperity theology and the Word of Faith movement.[4][5]\n\n\nEarly life and family[edit]\nOsteen was born in Houston, Texas, and is one of six children of John Osteen and Dolores (\"Dodie\") Pilgrim. His father, a former Southern Baptist pastor, founded Lakewood Church (of which Osteen is the current senior pastor) in the back of an old feed store.[6] He graduated from Humble High School, a public high school in the city of Humble, Texas, in 1981,[7] and attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he studied radio and television communications but did not graduate.[8][9][10] In 1982, he returned to Houston, founded Lakewood's television program, and produced his father's televised sermons for 17 years until January 1999, when his father died  of a heart attack.[8][11]\n\nCareer[edit]\nThis article contains content that is written like an advertisement. Please help improve it by removing promotional content and inappropriate external links, and by adding encyclopedic content written from a neutral point of view. (May 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nOsteen was ordained through his father's church in 1983 and preached his first sermon on January 17, 1999. By October 3, he was the new senior pastor of Lakewood Church.[12] In 2003, Lakewood Church acquired the Compaq Center, former home of the NBA Houston Rockets and the AHL Houston Aeros and subsequently renovated it.[13][14] According to Osteen, in 2008, Lakewood Church's weekly service TV program was viewed in more than 100 countries.[15]\nOsteen was included on Barbara Walters's list of the 10 Most Fascinating People of 2006.[16][17] Former presidential candidate John McCain described Osteen as his favorite inspirational author.[18] The Osteen family attended an Easter breakfast hosted by President Barack Obama at the White House in 2010.[19]\n\nPreaching style[edit]\nOsteen memorizes his planned remarks before he delivers them, and listens back to previous ones on tape.[20] His sermons have been criticized as self-serving and revealing a poor command of Scripture.[21][22][23][24] Osteen says he chooses to focus more on the goodness of God and on living an obedient life rather than on sin,[25] and that he tries to teach Biblical principles in a simple way, emphasizing the power of love and a positive attitude.[26] When asked why he does not focus more on sin, the devil, and hell in detail, Osteen stated in an interview with CBN News:\n\nWhen I grew up, the devil was a reason why I had a headache or the devil was the reason I got mad today. We always blamed the devil. I think today when I say the enemy, I like to make it broader. Sometimes the enemy can be our own thoughts. We've trained ourselves the wrong way. Or the enemy can be our own lack of discipline. Some people preach about hell like you're already going there, and to me the Gospel means \"Good News.\" I'd rather say God is a God of mercy. So I think the people already know what they're doing wrong, and I certainly believe in hell. But to me, when I see thousands of people before me, it just doesn't come out of me to say, \"You guys are terrible, and you're going to hell.\" I'd rather say that God is a God of mercy. You've got to live an obedient life, but for every mistake you've made, there's mercy there, and I believe we can do better.[11]\nEvents[edit]\nSince 2004, Osteen, along with his wife, have hosted Night of Hope events, as well as their annual stadium event called \"America's Night of Hope\", in the U.S. and around the world.[27][28][29] The event incorporates contemporary Christian music and inspirational messages to reach the masses at the venue and others watching online.[30] Osteen also hosted an event at his Lakewood Church in 2018, in collaboration with rapper Kanye West, called Sunday Service. According to media reports, the event was attended by 17,000 as well as joined by many people streaming online.[31] He also held his Easter service during COVID-19 with Mariah Carey and Tyler Perry.[32]\n\nBooks[edit]\nOsteen's first book, Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential, was released in October 2004, and reached the number 1 position on The New York Times Best Seller list.[33]\nHe released his second book, titled Become a Better You: 7 Keys to Improving Your Life Every Day, in October 2007. It also topped The New York Times Best Seller list[34] and had a first printing of three million copies.[35] Osteen has said that the book focuses more on relationships and not getting stuck where we are in life.[36]\nBesides those two books, Osteen has written more than 18 others. See, Book list.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nOn April 4, 1987, Osteen married Victoria Osteen (n\u00e9e Iloff), who later would become co-pastor of Lakewood Church.[2] They have a son, Jonathan (born April 20, 1995), and a daughter, Alexandra (born November 9, 1998).[37] In 2002, his older siblings, Paul, Lisa, and Tamara, and his younger sister, April, were also involved in full-time ministry, and his half-brother Justin was doing missionary work.[12]\nOsteen lives with his family in a 17,000 square-foot mansion in River Oaks, with an estimated value of $10.5 million.[38] Osteen says that as senior pastor, he draws no salary from the church, which has an annual budget of $70 million,[39] and that he instead relies on income from book sales.[40]\n\nPolitical and social views[edit]\nOsteen has generally avoided discussing or preaching about controversial issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and politics.[16][41] Having gone on record saying homosexuality is \"not God's best\",[42] he has stated he believes the church has a tendency to become overly focused on single issues (such as homosexuality) to the point of neglecting others.[16][43] When asked if he thought God approves of homosexuality, Osteen said homosexuality is a sin according to his interpretation of Scripture, but said gay people are welcome in his church without judgment.[44][45][43][46]\nIn an interview on Fox News in 2008 during the Republican Party presidential primary race, when discussing whether he thought that Mormons were Christians, Osteen indicated that he believed that they were. He further revealed that he had not studied the religion.[47] In an interview in 2011, Osteen stated his support for Israel.[48]\n\nControversies[edit]\nProsperity gospel[edit]\nOsteen's sermons and writings are sometimes criticized for promoting prosperity theology, or the prosperity gospel, a belief that the reward of material gain is the will of God for all pious Christians.[41][47][49][4] Critics of prosperity gospel consider its teachings anathema to the gospel of Mark:[50]\n\nJesus, looking at the man, loved him and said, \u2018You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.\u2019 When the man heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions.\u2014\u200aMark 10:21\u201322\nOn October 14, 2007, 60 Minutes ran a 12-minute segment on Osteen, titled \"Joel Osteen Answers His Critics\", during which Reformed theologian Michael Horton told CBS News correspondent Byron Pitts that Osteen's message is heresy. Horton stated that the problem with Osteen's message is that it makes religion about us instead of about God.[26]\nOsteen is estimated to have a net worth of over $50 million, with his church taking in $43 million a year in collections.[51]  According to the Houston Chronicle, Osteen\u2019s church\u2019s income was $89 million in the year ending March 2017. More than 90 percent of that was raised from church followers and barely one percent of its budget went to charitable causes.[52] Osteen denied taking any pandemic CARES Act assistance, but U.S. Small Business Administration data revealed his church actually received $4.4 million from the fund.[53]\n\nHurricane Harvey response[edit]\nDuring the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, Osteen received significant criticism for not making Lakewood Church, a 606,000-square-foot, 16,000-seat former sports arena, available as an emergency shelter for those displaced by the storm.[54][55][56][57][58][59] On August 27, posts from the church and a Lakewood Church associate pastor's social media accounts stated that the church was \"inaccessible due to severe flooding,\" and associate pastor John Gray posted further, \"If WE could get there WE WOULD OPEN THE DOORS.\"[60][61]  Lakewood spokesperson Don Iloff later described floodwaters as one foot from spilling over the facility's floodgate and surging into the building.[62] He also stated that pictures showing Lakewood free of flooding were taken on Monday, after the flood waters had lowered.[63][64]\nOsteen disputed the claim that flood waters closed the church, saying \"the church has been open from the beginning,\" and, \"[w]e've always been open ... How this notion got started, that we're not a shelter and we're not taking people in is a false narrative.\"[58][65] This contradicted his earlier statement that the church would open when other refugee centers were full.[58][66] On the evening of August 28, it was announced by Lakewood that it would open at noon the next day as an available shelter to storm victims and emergency personnel, which it did.[58]\nOn August 15, 2018, less than a year after Harvey struck, the City of Houston and Mayor Sylvester Turner proclaimed a day in honor of the assistance of Lakewood and Osteen in rebuilding efforts across the Houston area.[67][68]\n\nOther[edit]\nIn 2011, Osteen and Lakewood Church were sued by the band The American Dollar for copyright infringement.[69] A judge in 2012 ruled in favor of Osteen, but gave The American Dollar leave to amend the case.[70]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\nList of film and television appearances\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2007\n\nFriends of God: A Road Trip with Alexandra Pelosi\n\nHimself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2014\n\nWords of Art\n\nHimself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2015\n\nI Hope You Dance: The Power and Spirit of Song\n\nHimself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2017\n\nThe Star\n\nCaspar\n\nVoice role\n\nPartial list of books[edit]\nYour Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential (2004)\nDaily Readings from Your Best Life Now: 90 Devotions for Living at Your Full Potential (2005)\nBecome a Better You: 7 Keys to Improving Your Life Every Day (2007)[71]\nYour Best Life Begins Each Morning: Devotions to Start Every New Day of the Year (2008)\nIt's Your Time\u00a0: Activate Your Faith, Achieve Your Dreams, and Increase in God's Favor (2009)[72]\nIt's Your Time: Finding Favor, Restoration, and Abundance in Your Life Every Day (2009)\nEveryday a Friday: How to Be Happier 7 Days a Week (2011)\nI Declare: 31 Promises to Speak Over Your Life (2012)\nBreak Out!: 5 Keys to Go Beyond Your Barriers and Live an Extraordinary Life (2013)\nYou Can You Will: 8 Undeniable Qualities of a Winner (2014)\nFresh Start: the New You Begins Today (2015)\nThe Power of I Am: Two Words That Will Change Your Life Today (2015)\nThink Better, Live Better: A Victorious Life Begins in Your Mind (2016)\nBlessed in the Darkness: How All Things Are Working for Your Good (2017)\nEmpty Out the Negative (2017)\nNext Level Thinking: 10 Powerful Thoughts for a Successful and Abundant Life (2018)\nThe Power of Favor: The Force That Will Take You Where You Can't Go on Your Own (2019)\nThe Abundance Mind-Set: Success Starts Here (2020)\nPeaceful on Purpose: The Power to Remain Calm, Strong, and Confident in Every Season (2021)\nYou Are Stronger than You Think: Unleash the Power to Go Bigger, Go Bold, and Go Beyond What Limits You (2021)\nRule Your Day: 6 Keys to Maximizing Your Success and Accelerating Your Dreams (2022)\nYour Greater is Coming: Discover the Path to Your Bigger, Better, and Brighter Future (2022)\n15 Ways to Live Longer and Healthier: Life-Changing Strategies for Greater Energy, a More Focused Mind, and a Calmer Soul (2023)\nPsalms and Proverbs for Everyday Life: 100 Daily Devotions (2023)\nBelieve: Hope Has Your Name on It (2023)\nSpeak the Blessing: Send Your Words in the Direction You Want Your Life to Go  (2024)\nSee also[edit]\nChristianity in Houston\nCharismatic movement\nGospel of success\nWord of Faith\nLakewood Church\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Obituary: Pastor John H.

The district included several rural and suburban areas near Cincinnati and Dayton.\nBoehner previously served as the House Minority Leader from 2007 until 2011, and House Majority Leader from 2006 until 2007. In January 2011, he was first elected Speaker and then re-elected twice. Boehner resigned from the House of Representatives in October 2015 due to opposition from within the Republican conference.\nIn September 2016, Squire Patton Boggs, the third-largest lobbying firm in the U.S., announced that Boehner would join their firm. It was also announced that he would become a board member of Reynolds American.[5]\n\n\nEarly life and education\nBoehner was born in Reading, Ohio, the son of Mary Anne (n\u00e9e Hall; 1926\u20131998) and Earl Henry Boehner (1925\u20131990), the second of twelve children. His father was of German descent and his mother had German and Irish ancestry.[10] He grew up in modest circumstances, sharing one bathroom with his eleven siblings in a two-bedroom house in Cincinnati.[11] He started working at his family's bar at age 8, a business founded by their grandfather Andy Boehner in 1938.[11] He has lived in Southwest Ohio his entire life.[12][13]\nBoehner attended Cincinnati's Moeller High School and was a linebacker on the school's football team, where he was coached by future Notre Dame coach Gerry Faust.[21] Graduating from Moeller in 1968, when United States involvement in the Vietnam War was at its peak, Boehner enlisted in the United States Navy but was honorably discharged after eight weeks because of a bad back.[22][citation needed] He earned his B.A. in business administration from Xavier University in 1977, becoming the first person in his family to attend college, taking seven years as he held several jobs to pay for his education.[11]\n\nEarly career\nShortly after his graduation in 1977, Boehner accepted a position with Nucite Sales, a small sales business in the plastics industry. He was steadily promoted and eventually became president of the firm, resigning in 1990 when he was elected to Congress.[3]\nFrom 1981 to 1984, Boehner served on the board of trustees of Union Township, Butler County, Ohio. He then served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1985 to 1990.[23]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nBoehner in 1993\nIn 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent Congressman Buz Lukens, who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor. He was all but unknown when he entered a Republican primary that included Lukens and former Congressman Tom Kindness. Despite being dramatically outspent, Boehner won with 49 percent of the vote.[24] He then handily beat his Democratic opponent, Greg Jolivette, in the November election. He was subsequently re-elected to Congress 12 times, each by a substantial margin.\nBoehner's closest races were those in:\n\n2006, when he defeated the Democratic Party candidate, U.S. Air Force veteran Mort Meier, 64% to 36%;[25]\n2008, when he defeated Nicholas Von Stein, 68% to 32%;[26]\n2010, when he garnered 66% percent of the vote in a four-way race against Democratic nominee Justin Coussoule, Constitution Party nominee Jim Condit, and Libertarian nominee David Harlow.[27]\nGang of Seven and Contract with America\nDuring his freshman year, Boehner was a member of the Gang of Seven which was involved in bringing media attention to the House banking scandal.[28] The group also investigated the Congressional Post Office, leading to the indictment of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski.[24] Later, he, along with Newt Gingrich and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the Contract with America in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the 1994 elections during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.\n\nRepublican leadership\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Boehner served as House Republican Conference Chairman, making him fourth-ranking House Republican behind Gingrich, Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay.[24] During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the Freedom to Farm Act that, among other provisions, revised and simplified direct payment programs for crops and eliminated milk price supports through direct government purchases.\nIn the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw Speaker Newt Gingrich's public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted \"coup\" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.[29]\nOn July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats\u00a0\u2013 along with dissenting Republicans\u00a0\u2013 would vote in Dick Gephardt as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign from his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.[30]\nAfter Republicans lost seats in the 1998 elections, the House Republican leadership underwent a reorganization. Armey and DeLay kept their positions, but Gingrich was replaced by Dennis Hastert, and Boehner lost his position as conference chairman to J.C. Watts.[24]\n\nChairman of Committee on Education and Labor\nBoehner addresses the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) while serving as House Minority Leader\nFollowing the election of President George W. Bush, Boehner was elected as chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, serving from 2001 until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the Pension Protection Act and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, D.C.[31]\nBoehner and Senator Ted Kennedy authored the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which was signed by President George W. Bush in 2002.[32] Boehner said that it was his \"proudest achievement\" in two decades of public service.[33] Boehner was friends with Kennedy, also a Catholic, and every year they chaired fundraisers for cash-strapped Catholic schools.[34]\n\nHouse Republican Leader\n2006 portrait of Boehner\nAfter DeLay resigned as majority leader in 2005, Boehner, House Majority Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri, and Representative John Shadegg of Arizona, all sought to become Majority Leader.[24] Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called \"earmark\" process and rein in government spending. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as majority whip, the no. 3 leadership positions in the House. There was some confusion on the first ballot for majority leader when the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,[35] due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico Luis Fortu\u00f1o to vote.[36]\nAfter the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as the minority leader. While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker Dennis Hastert, as minority leader he was the leader of the House Republicans. As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Nancy Pelosi.\nAccording to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Sander M. Levin, Dean of the House John Dingell, and Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey, all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.[37] As minority leader, Boehner served as an ex officio member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nSpeaker of the House (2011\u20132015)\nSpeaker Boehner greets U.S. President Barack Obama before the 2011 State of the Union Address\nThe Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats. During his solemn victory speech, Boehner broke into tears when talking about \"economic freedom, individual liberty and personal responsibility...I hold these values dear because I've lived them...I've spent my whole life chasing the American Dream\".[34] On November 17, 2010, Boehner was unanimously chosen by the House Republicans as their nominee for Speaker,[38][39] all but assuring his formal election to the post when the new Congress convened with a Republican majority in January 2011. He received the gavel from outgoing Speaker Pelosi on Wednesday, January 5, 2011.[40] He was the first Speaker from Ohio since fellow Republicans Nicholas Longworth (1925 to 1931) and J. Warren Keifer (1881 to 1883). He was also the first Speaker who has served both as majority and minority floor leader for his party since Texas Democrat Sam Rayburn.[citation needed]\n\nSpeaker Boehner meets with Pope Francis during his visit to the United States Congress\nAs Speaker, he was still the leader of the House Republicans. However, by tradition, he normally did not take part in debate, although he had the right to do so, and rarely voted from the floor.[41] He was not a member of any House committees during his Speakership.\nBoehner was narrowly re-elected as Speaker of the House on January 3, 2013, at the beginning of the 113th United States Congress.[42] He received 220 votes, needing 214 to win.[43]\nIn July 2014, Boehner moved forward on a lawsuit to force the President to impose penalties on companies who failed to provide healthcare coverage for their employees.[44] Boehner had pressed for legislation to delay this mandate the previous year.[45] The third law firm selected finally filed the suit in November 2014, after Boehner criticized Obama's unilateral moves on immigration policy.[46]\n\nResignation\nSee also: October 2015 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election\nSpeaker Boehner looks at the National Mall from the Speaker's balcony at the U.S. Capitol for one final time before leaving office\nOn September 25, 2015, Boehner announced that he would step down as Speaker and resign from Congress at the end of October 2015. Boehner's resignation took place after Pope Francis' address to Congress the day before, an event considered by Boehner personally as the highest point in his legislative career. Sources in his office indicated he was stepping aside in the face of increasing discord while trying to manage the passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government. Conservative opposition to funding Planned Parenthood as part of the resolution, and stronger threats to Boehner's leadership on account of the controversy, prompted the resignation.[47]\nOriginally, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California had intended to run for Speaker and was seen as the prohibitive favorite. On October 8, 2015, McCarthy abruptly rescinded his candidacy, citing that he felt he could not effectively lead a fractured Republican Conference. After McCarthy's announcement, Boehner stayed on as Speaker until a successor was chosen.[48] After initially turning down requests from Republican leaders, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Ways and Means Committee chairman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, ran for Speaker with Boehner's blessing.[49] On October 29, 2015, in his final act as Speaker, Boehner presided over Ryan's election.[50] Boehner's resignation from Congress became official on October 31, 2015, at 11:59\u00a0p.m.[51]\n\nControversies\nThis article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section may compromise the article's neutrality. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. (June 2015)\nConnections to lobbyists\nIn June 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from tobacco industry lobbyists on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.[52] In a 1996 documentary by PBS called The People and the Power Game, Boehner said \"They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done so. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that's gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again.\"[53] Boehner eventually led the effort to change House rules and prohibit campaign contributions from being distributed on the House floor.[54]\nA September 2010 story in The New York Times said Boehner was \"Tightly Bound to Lobbyists\" and that \"He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.\".[55]\n\nSmithsonian\nIn November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor, called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery after he learned that it featured a video by David Wojnarowicz, A Fire in My Belly, that contained an image of a crucifix with ants crawling on it. Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith said, \"Smithsonian officials should either acknowledge the mistake and correct it, or be prepared to face tough scrutiny beginning in January when the new majority in the House moves [in].\"[56]\n\nHurricane Sandy relief bill\nOn January 1, 2013, after passing the fiscal cliff deal, Boehner adjourned the House without passing the $60 million Hurricane Sandy relief bill. Some Representatives, especially from the Northeast and including Republicans as well as Democrats, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie harshly criticized Boehner.[57] Boehner later promised to pass the bill.[58]\n\nChallenged 2015 House Chair election\nMany Republicans were ready for a new House of Representatives Chairman following the 2014 mid-term elections. EMC Research reported 60% of participants in their telephone survey wanted a new chairman.[59] In the end there were a total of 25 votes against Boehner; 29 were needed in order to choose a new speaker. Boehner responded by removing those who opposed him from influential committees.[60]\n\nPolitical positions\nBoehner introducing then-president George W. Bush in Troy, Ohio in 2003\nBoehner speaking at the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference\nA profile in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review said, \"On both sides of the aisle, Boehner earns praise for candor and an ability to listen.\"[61] The Plain Dealer says Boehner \"has perfected the art of disagreeing without being disagreeable.\"[62]\nBoehner has been classified as a \"hard-core conservative\" by OnTheIssues.[63] Although Boehner has a conservative voting record when he was running for House leadership, religious conservatives in the GOP expressed that they were not satisfied with his positions. According to The Washington Post: \"From illegal immigration to sanctions on China to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were contrary to those of many in his party. Religious conservatives \u2013 examining his voting record \u2013 see him as a policymaker driven by small-government economic concerns, not theirs.\"[64]\nBoehner opposes same-sex marriage, as evidenced by his vote for the Federal Marriage Amendment in both 2004 and 2006. In a letter to the Human Rights Campaign, Boehner stated, \"I oppose any legislation that would provide special rights for homosexuals... Please be assured that I will continue to work to protect the idea of the traditional family as one of the fundamental tenets of western civilization.\"[65][66]\nOn May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement defending his agenda and attacking his \"Democrat friends\" such as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Boehner said regarding national security that voters \"have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-9/11 world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in Iraq.\"\nBoehner is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[67]\nIn June 2013, Boehner labeled former NSA contractor Edward Snowden a traitor after his leaks went public.[68]\n\"I'm not qualified to debate the science over climate change\", Boehner said at a press conference on May 29, 2014, at which he criticized proposed federal regulations on coal-fired power plants.[69][70][71]\nIn 2011, Boehner opposed the NATO-led military intervention in Libya.[72] In 2015, Boehner supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying: \"I applaud the Saudis for taking this action to protect their homeland and to protect their neighborhood.\"[73]\n\nFinancial crisis\nSpeaker Boehner meets with President Obama at the White House during the 2011 debt ceiling increase negotiations\nOn September 18, 2008, Congressman Boehner attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and was urged to craft legislation to help financially troubled banks. That same day (trade effective the next day), Congressman Boehner cashed out of an equity mutual fund.[74]\nOn October 3, 2008, Boehner voted in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP),[75] believing that the enumerated powers grant Congress the authority to \"purchase assets and equity from financial institutions to strengthen its financial sector.\"\nBoehner had been highly critical of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress and President Barack Obama, including the \"cap and trade\" plan that Boehner said would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and said that, if Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would do whatever it takes to stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect of the Act, not paying \"one dime\" of the salaries of the workers who would administer the plan.[76] He also led opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama's first budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan[77] and a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep. Paul Ryan, R-WI).[78] He advocated for an across-the-board spending freeze, including entitlement programs.\nBoehner favored making changes in Social Security, such as by raising the retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years until retirement, as well as tying cost-of-living increases to the consumer price index rather than wage inflation, and limiting payments to those who need them.[76]\nIn 2011, Boehner called the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act \"one of our highest legislative priorities.\"[79][80]\nIn 2013, Boehner led his caucus in a strategy to freeze Defense spending in order to avoid reducing the deficit with revenue increases.[81]\nAs Republican House Leader, Boehner was a Democratic target for criticism of Republican views and political positions. In July 2010, President Barack Obama began singling out Boehner for criticism during his speeches.[82] In one speech, Obama mentioned Boehner's name nine times,[83] and accused him of believing that police, firefighters, and teachers were jobs \"not worth saving\".[84]\n\nLater career\nPolitics\nBoehner made headlines in April 2016 when he referred to Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz as \"Lucifer in the flesh\" in an interview at Stanford University.[85] On May 12, after Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, Boehner's support for him (while distancing himself from Trump on several policies) became public; he also expressed satisfaction with Cruz not securing the nomination: \"Thank God the guy from Texas didn't win.\"[86] On February 23, 2017, Boehner predicted Republicans would \"fix\" the Affordable Care Act and give it a different name as opposed to their stated intent to repeal and replace.[87]\nOn August 17, 2020, a spokesperson for Boehner stated that he would not endorse either President Trump or Joe Biden for the 2020 United States presidential election, saying: \"The answer is no. I think he'd rather set himself on fire than get involved in the election. Nothing to see here.\"[88] Despite his critiques, Boehner confirmed he voted for Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Explaining his vote, he said: \"At the end of the day, who gets nominated to the federal courts is the most important thing a President does.\"[89]\nAfter the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Boehner called on Republicans to \"awaken\", saying: \"The invasion of our Capitol by a mob, incited by lies from some entrusted with power, is a disgrace to all who sacrificed to build our Republic.\"[90] Boehner later congratulated Biden on his victory after the vote was certified.[90] He has frequently reiterated his feelings, on one account noting how Trump \"Incited That Bloody Insurrection\",[91] and called Ted Cruz \"a reckless asshole who thinks he is smarter than everyone else\".[92] Boehner said that Trump should \"consider resigning\" and that President Trump had \"violated his oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"[93] Boehner continued to express his disdain for Trump through 2023, where he stated his belief that the GOP needs to \"move on\" from Trump during a June interview with CBS News.[94]\nBoehner's political memoir, titled On the House: A Washington Memoir, was published by St. Martin's Press on April 13, 2021. Excerpts began appearing early in April.[95] In this memoir, he lambasts Cruz, Michele Bachmann, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and Trump. It also covers how the Tea Party movement, which forced him into retirement, later morphed into Trumpism.[96] In response to the criticism he received in the book, Cruz threatened to burn Boehner's book if his supporters could fulfil his \u201c72-hour drive to raise $250,000\u201d in campaign funds.[97]\nDespite his resignation from politics, during the October 2023 Speaker of the House election following the removal of Kevin McCarthy, Boehner received one vote to reprise his role as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.[98]\n\nBusiness\nBoehner joined the board of tobacco company Reynolds American on September 15, 2016.[99]\nIn 2018 Boehner joined the board of Acreage Holdings, a cannabis corporation, to promote the medical use of cannabis and advocate for federal de-scheduling of the drug (a shift from his previous stance while in Congress).[100] In 2019, Boehner was named chair of the National Cannabis Roundtable, a cannabis lobbying organization.[101]\n\nLegacy\nIn reporting his pending retirement, Politico summarized his Speakership:\n\nBoehner came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with social conservatives over the debt limit, government funding, Obamacare[102] and taxes. But his tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried\u00a0\u2013 but repeatedly failed\u00a0\u2013 to cut a deal on a sweeping fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to entitlement programs.[103]\nPaul Kane in The Washington Post emphasizes how none of the \"big deals\" he sought were ever reached:\n\nBoehner never landed the really big deal he craved. Not the $4 trillion tax-and-entitlement deal he reached for in 2011, not the repackaged version a year later and not the immigration overhaul he sought in 2014.[104]\nFurthermore, Kane argues, Boehner's persona alienated conservative Republicans who demanded more vigorous attacks on Obama and instead perceived, \"a country club Republican who loved to play 18 holes of golf and drink merlot afterward while cutting deals. In an era of shouting and confrontation, on talk radio or cable TV, Boehner's easygoing style did not fit.\"[104]\n\nPersonal life\nBoehner and his wife Debbie were married in 1973, and lived in the Wetherington section of West Chester Township, Ohio. They have two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia.[105] Boehner has been known to be emotional and cry during noteworthy events.[106][107]\nOn May 15, 2016, Boehner was awarded the Laetare Medal, considered the highest honor for American Catholics, by the University of Notre Dame. The medal was awarded to Joe Biden at the same time.[108][109]\n\nPublications\nBoehner, John (2021). On the House: A Washington Memoir. New York: St. Martin's Press. ISBN\u00a0978-1250238443.

He served as the 25th United States Ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006, and as the 26th United States National Security Advisor from 2018 to 2019.\nBolton served as a United States Assistant Attorney General for President Ronald Reagan from 1985 to 1989. He served in the State Department as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs from 1989 to 1993, and Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs from 2001 to 2005. He was an advocate of the Iraq War as a Director of the Project for the New American Century, which favored going to war with Iraq.[8]\nHe was the United States Ambassador to the United Nations from August 2005 to December 2006, as a recess appointee by President George W. Bush.[9] He stepped down at the end of his recess appointment in December 2006[10][11] because he was unlikely to win confirmation from the Senate, of which the Democratic Party had gained control at the time.[10][12] Bolton later served as the National Security Advisor to President Donald Trump from April 2018 to September 2019. He repeatedly called for the termination of the Iran nuclear deal, from which the U.S. withdrew in May 2018. He wrote a best-selling book about his tenure in the Trump administration, The Room Where It Happened, published in June 2020.[13]\nBolton is widely considered a foreign policy hawk and is an advocate for military action and regime change by the US in Iran, Syria, Libya, Venezuela, Cuba, Yemen, and North Korea.[14][15][8][16] A member of the Republican Party, his political views have been described as American nationalist,[17][18] conservative,[19][20][21][22] and neoconservative,[23] although Bolton rejects the last term.[24][25][26] He is a former senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI),[27] and Fox News Channel commentator. He was a foreign policy adviser to 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney.[28]\n\n\nEarly life, education, and early career[edit]\nBolton in McDonogh School's 1966 yearbook\nBolton was born on November 20, 1948, in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Virginia Clara \"Ginny\" (n\u00e9e Godfrey), a housewife, and Edward Jackson \"Jack\" Bolton, a Baltimore fireman.[29][30][31]:\u200a4\u200a He grew up in the working-class neighborhood of Yale Heights, and won a scholarship to the McDonogh School in Owings Mills, Maryland, graduating in 1966.[29] He also ran the school's Students For Goldwater campaign in 1964.[32][33]\nBolton attended Yale College, earning a Bachelor of Arts and graduating summa cum laude in 1970. He was a member of the Yale Political Union. He attended Yale Law School from 1971 to 1974, where he shared classes and student housing with his friend Clarence Thomas, earning a Juris Doctor in 1974.[31]:\u200a12\u200a\nIn 1972, Bolton was a summer intern for Vice President Spiro Agnew.[31]:\u200a12\u201313\u200a[34] He was hired for the position by David Keene.[31]:\u200a12\u201313\u200a\n\nVietnam War[edit]\nBolton was a supporter of the Vietnam War,[35] but avoided combat through a student deferment followed by enlistment in the Maryland Air National Guard.[29][36][37] During the 1969 Vietnam War draft lottery, Bolton drew number 185. (Draft numbers were assigned by birth date. Numbers 1 to 195 were eventually called up.)[38] As a result of the Johnson and Nixon administrations' decisions to rely largely on the draft rather than on the reserve forces, joining a Guard or Reserve unit became a way to reduce the chances of service in Vietnam.[39] Before graduating from Yale College in 1970, Bolton enlisted in the Maryland Army National Guard rather than waiting to find out if his draft number would be called.[31]:\u200a11\u200a[40][41] He attended Active Duty for Training (ADT) at Fort Polk, Louisiana, from July to November 1970.[31]:\u200a11\u200a After serving in the National Guard for four years, he served in the United States Army Reserve until the end of his enlistment two years later.[7]\nHe wrote in his Yale 25th reunion book: \"I confess I had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy. I considered the war in Vietnam already lost.\"[36] In a 2007 interview, Bolton explained his comment in the reunion book saying his decision to avoid service in Vietnam was because \"by the time I was about to graduate in 1970, it was clear to me that opponents of the Vietnam War had made it certain we could not prevail, and that I had no great interest in going there to have Teddy Kennedy give it back to the people I might die to take it away from.\"[35][42] In his 2007 book, Surrender Is Not an Option, Bolton described his perception of the war as a \"futile struggle\", and that \"dying for your country was one thing, but dying to gain territory that antiwar forces in Congress would simply return to the enemy seemed ludicrous to me. Looking back, I am not terribly proud of this calculation...\"[31]:\u200a11\u200a\n\nAttorney[edit]\nFrom 1974 to 1981, Bolton was an associate at the Washington, D.C. office of Covington & Burling; he returned to the firm again from 1983 to 1985. Bolton was also a partner in the law firm of Lerner, Reed, Bolton & McManus, from 1993 to 1999.[43][44][45] He was of counsel in the Washington, D.C. office of Kirkland & Ellis from 2008 until his appointment as National Security Advisor in 2018.[46][47][48] In September 2015, Freedom Capital Investment Management appointed Bolton as a senior advisor.[49]\n\nReagan and George H.W. Bush administrations[edit]\nDuring the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, his governmental roles were within the State Department, the Justice Department, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of conservative North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms.[50]\nHis Justice Department position as an assistant attorney general required him to advance Reagan administration positions, including[51] opposition to financial reparations to Japanese-Americans held in World War II-era internment camps;[52] the insistence on Reagan's executive privilege during William Rehnquist's chief justice confirmation hearings, when Congress asked for memos written by Rehnquist as a Nixon Justice Department official;[53] shepherding the judicial nomination process for Antonin Scalia;[51] and the framing of a bill to control illegal immigration as an essential drug war measure.[51] He was also involved in the Iran\u2013Contra affair.[54][55][56]\nBolton's government service included positions such as:\n\nAssistant secretary for International Organization Affairs at the Department of State (1989\u20131993);\nAssistant Attorney General for the Civil Division (1988\u20131989);[57]\nAssistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs, Department of Justice (1985\u20131988);[7]\nAssistant administrator for program and policy coordination, USAID (1982\u20131983); and\nGeneral counsel, USAID (1981\u20131982).[43][44] While working for USAID, Lynne Finney, a legal adviser for the agency, alleged that Bolton threatened to fire her for refusing to lobby for the deregulation of baby formula in developing nations.[58]\nUnder Secretary of State (2001\u20132005)[edit]\nBolton joins Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld in negotiations with Rumsfeld's Russian counterpart\nBolton worked as the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, sworn into this position on May 11, 2001. In this role, a key area of his responsibility was the prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nBolton negotiated so-called \"Article 98\" agreements with countries to prohibit them from turning Americans over to the International Criminal Court, which is not recognized by the U.S.[59][60] Bolton said the decision to pull out of the ICC was the \"happiest moment\" of his political career to date.[59][61]\n\nWeapons of mass destruction[edit]\nBolton was instrumental in derailing a 2001 biological weapons conference in Geneva convened to endorse a UN proposal to enforce the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. He argued that the plan would have jeopardized U.S. national security by allowing spot inspections of suspected U.S. weapons sites.[62]\nIn May 2002, Bolton gave a speech entitled \"Beyond the Axis of Evil\" in response to President Bush's State of the Union Address (where Bush characterized Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as part of an \"Axis of Evil\"). Bolton added three more nations to be grouped with the aforementioned rogue states: Cuba, Libya, and Syria. Bolton said they were all \"state sponsors of terrorism that are pursuing or who have the potential to pursue weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or have the capability to do so in violation of their treaty obligations.\"[63] During his time as Under Secretary of State, Bolton \"sought to block, and often succeeded in sabotaging\" the negotiations that Secretary of State Colin Powell had conducted with North Korea.[64]\nAlso in 2002, Bolton is said to have flown to Europe to demand the resignation of Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Bustani, head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and to have orchestrated his removal at a special session of the organization.[65] Bustani was deemed to be an obstacle in creating the case for the invasion of Iraq.[66] The United Nations' highest administrative tribunal later condemned the action as an \"unacceptable violation\" of principles protecting international civil servants. Bustani had been unanimously re-elected for a four-year term\u2014with strong U.S. support\u2014in May 2000, and in 2001 was praised for his leadership by Colin Powell.[67] According to Bustani, John Bolton demanded that he step down in 24 hours, adding, \"We know where your children are.\"[68]\nHe also pushed for reduced funding for the Nunn\u2013Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program to halt the proliferation of nuclear materials.[69] At the same time, he was involved in the implementation of the Proliferation Security Initiative, working with a number of countries to intercept the trafficking in weapons of mass destruction and in materials for use in building nuclear weapons.[70]\n\nDiplomacy[edit]\nAccording to an article in The New Republic, Bolton was highly successful in pushing his agenda, but his bluntness made him many enemies. \"Iran's Foreign Ministry has called Bolton 'rude' and 'undiplomatic'.\"[71] In response to critics, Bolton says his record \"demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy.\" Bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position. \"It's like the Palestinians' having to negotiate with [Israeli Prime Minister] Ariel Sharon. If you have a deal, you know you have a deal,\" an anonymous official told CNN.[72] He also \"won widespread praise for his work establishing the Proliferation Security Initiative, a voluntary agreement supported (at the time) by 60 countries\".[73]\n\nInterventions[edit]\nIn July 2022, during an interview with CNN reporter Jake Tapper, denying that President Donald Trump's involvement in the \nJanuary 6 United States Capitol attack amounted to an attempt to overthrow the U.S. government, Bolton admitted to his personal involvement in planning unspecified coups d'\u00e9tat in foreign countries.[74]\n\n\"As somebody who has helped plan coups d'etat \u2014 not here but, you know, other places \u2014 it takes a lot of work, and that's not what [President Donald Trump] did\"\u2014\u200aJohn Bolton[75]\nAccording to Reuters, \"it is highly unusual for U.S. officials to openly acknowledge their role in stoking unrest in foreign countries.\"[76]\n\nUnsubstantiated claims about a Cuban WMD program[edit]\nIn 2002, Bolton delivered a speech at the Heritage Foundation where he accused Cuba of having a secret biological weapons program, and of collaborating with Libya and Iran.[45][77][78] Bolton asserted, \"The United States believes that Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort. Cuba has provided dual-use biotechnology to other rogue states.\"[78][79] Bolton made the remarks a week before former President Jimmy Carter was scheduled to meet Fidel Castro in Cuba, becoming the first U.S. president since the Cuban Revolution to visit Cuba in an effort to build bridges between the two countries.[78]\nThe State Department's chief bioweapons analyst refused to approve the accusation made in the speech, telling Bolton that the State Department did not have evidence to substantiate Bolton's accusation.[45][77][78][80] Subsequently, Bolton berated the analyst, unsuccessfully sought to fire him, began to exclude the analyst's supervisor from meetings, and tried to transfer the analyst to a different office.[45][77][78] Bolton was also alleged to have sought to punish other intelligence officers who refused to endorse his claims about Cuba.[69][78][81] Paul Pillar described Bolton's attempts to get the intelligence community to endorse his views as among the most egregious recent instances of \"arm-twisting\" the intelligence community,[80] while Columbia University international relations scholar Richard K. Betts described the reports about Bolton's pressure as \"most blatant top-down pressure on intelligence\" in the Bush administration.[82] Bolton claims the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers, who did not work under him, behaved unprofessionally.[77]\nIn April 2004, Bolton again accused Cuba of being a \"terrorist and (biological weapons) threat to the United States.\"[83] Experts at the time disputed the veracity of Bolton's claims, saying the evidence in support of the claim was weak.[84] In September 2004 and in the wake of the failure to locate WMDs in Iraq, the Bush administration backed off claims that Cuba had an active biological weapons program.[85]\n\nCriticism[edit]\nDemocratic Congressman Henry Waxman alleged that Bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of the statement that British Intelligence had determined Iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from Niger in Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address.[86] These statements were claimed by critics of the President to be partly based on documents found to be forged.[87] Waxman's allegations could not be confirmed, as they were based on classified documents.[86]\nBolton stated in June 2004 congressional testimony that Iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination: \"Another unmistakable indicator of Iran's intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to\u00a0... the IAEA\u00a0... when evidence of uranium enriched to 36 percent was found, it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts.\" However, later isotope analysis supported Iran's explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium.[88] At their August 2005 meeting the IAEA's Board of Governors concluded: \"Based on the information currently available to the Agency, the results of that analysis tend, on balance, to support Iran's statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed HEU [highly enriched uranium] contamination.\"[89]\nBolton has often been accused of attempting to pressure the intelligence community to endorse his views.[80][90][91] According to former coworkers, Bolton withheld information that ran counter to his goals from Secretary of State Colin Powell on multiple occasions, and from Powell's successor Condoleezza Rice on at least one occasion.[91][92]\n\nAmbassador to the United Nations (2005\u20132006)[edit]\nPresident George W. Bush announces Bolton's nomination as U.S. ambassador to the UN. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice looks on.\nOn March 7, 2005, Bolton was nominated to the post of United States Ambassador to the United Nations by President George W. Bush.[72][93] \nBolton said previously at a forum that \"there is no such thing as the United Nations\" and \"[i]f the U.N. secretary building in New York lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference\".[72] Several officials from U.N. Security Council member states were shocked of the nomination, Bush would name someone they believed had a known antipathy toward the United Nations.[72] As a result of a Democratic filibuster, he was recess-appointed to the post on August 1, 2005. Bolton's nomination received strong support from Republicans but faced heavy opposition from Democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the United Nations.\nHolding a 10\u20138 majority in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees), the Republican leadership hoped to send Bolton's nomination to the full Senate with a positive recommendation. Concern among some Republicans on the committee, however, prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation. In the full Senate, Republican support for the nomination remained uncertain, with the most vocal Republican critic, Ohio Senator George V. Voinovich, circulating a letter urging his Republican colleagues to oppose the nomination.[94] Democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature, given the resistance of the White House to share classified documents related to Bolton's alleged actions. The Republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate, but because a supermajority of 60 votes is needed to end debate, the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a 55\u201344 majority in the body. An earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the Democrats to relate only to judicial nominees,[95] not ambassadorships, although the leader of the effort, Sen. John McCain, said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees.\nOn November 9, 2006, Bush, only days after losing both houses to a Democratic majority, sent the nomination[96] for Bolton to continue as representative for the United States at the UN.[97] He said: \"I believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences. And I believe we will be able to work through differences. I reassured the House and Senate leaders that I intend to work with the new Congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country.\"[98]\n\n2005 nomination, Senate confirmation hearings[edit]\nOn April 11, 2005, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reviewed Bolton's qualifications. Bolton said he and his colleagues \"view the U.N. as an important component of our diplomacy\" and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths,[99] echoing Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's words from a month earlier.[100]\nOn the first day of the hearings, Republican committee chairman Richard Lugar criticized Bolton for ignoring the \"policy consequences\" of his statements, saying diplomatic speech \"should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the U.S. public opinion or to validate a personal point of view.\"[101] The committee's top Democrat, Joe Biden, compared sending Bolton to the UN to sending a \"bull into a china shop,\" and expressed \"grave concern\" about Bolton's \"diplomatic temperament\" and his record: \"In my judgment, your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful,\" Biden said.[102] Republican Senator George Allen said Bolton had the \"experience,\" \"knowledge,\" \"background,\" \"and the right principles to come into the United Nations at this time,\" calling him \"the absolute perfect person for the job.\"[103] Democratic Senator Russ Feingold asked Bolton about what he would have done had the Rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the United Nations, and criticized his answer\u2014which focused on logistics\u2014as \"amazingly passive.\"[104]\nOn the second day, April 12, 2005, the Senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that Bolton pressured intelligence analysts. Calling Bolton a \"serial abuser\", former State Department intelligence chief Carl W. Ford Jr. said, \"I've never seen anybody quite like Secretary Bolton\u00a0... I don't have a second, third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people.\" Ford contradicted Bolton's earlier testimony, saying: \"I had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done.\" Ford also characterized Bolton as a \"kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy\", implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him, while having very little regard for people working under him.[105]\nLugar, who criticized Bolton at his April 11 hearing, said the \"paramount issue\" was supporting Bush's nominee. He conceded that \"bluntness\u00a0... may be required\", even though it is not \"very good diplomacy\".[106] Chafee, the key member for Bolton's approval, said \"the bar is very high\" for rejecting the president's nominees, suggesting that Bolton would make it to the Senate.[107]\nOn April 19, Democrats, with support from Voinovich, forced Lugar to delay the committee vote on Bolton's nomination until May. The debate concerning his nomination raged in the Senate prior to the Memorial Day recess. Two other Republicans on the Foreign Relations Committee, Chafee and Chuck Hagel, also expressed serious concerns about the Bolton nomination.[108] Asked on April 20 if he was now less inclined to support the nomination, Chafee said, \"That would be accurate.\" He elaborated that Bolton's prospects were \"hard to predict\" but said he expected that \"the administration is really going to put some pressure on Senator Voinovich. Then it comes to the rest of us [who] have had some reservations.\"[108]\nOn April 20, it emerged that Melody Townsel, a former USAID contractor, had reported to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in Moscow. Townsel's encounter with Bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for USAID, IBTCI. Townsel told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff that Bolton had made derogatory remarks about her sexual orientation and weight, among other workplace improprieties. In an official interview with Senate Foreign Relation Committee staff, Townsel detailed her accusations against Bolton, which were confirmed by Canadian designer Uno Ramat, who had served as an IBTCI employee and one of Townsel's AID colleagues. Time magazine, among other publications, verified Townsel's accusations and Ramat's supporting testimony, and Townsel's story was transcribed and entered into the official Senate committee record. Townsel, who was an employee of Young & Rubicam at the time of her encounter with Bolton, continued working for the company on a variety of other USAID projects.[109][110][111]\nOn April 22, The New York Times and other media reported that Bolton's former boss, Colin Powell, personally opposed the nomination and had been in personal contact with Chafee and Hagel. The same day, Reuters reported that a spokesman for Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) had said the Senator felt the committee \"did the right thing delaying the vote on Bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee.\"[112]\nAlso on May 11, Newsweek reported allegations that the American position at the 7th Review Conference in May 2005 of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty had been undercut by Bolton's \"absence without leave\" during the nomination fight, quoting anonymous sources \"close to the negotiations\".[113]\n\nDemocrats' filibuster[edit]\nOn May 26, 2005, Senate Democrats postponed the vote on Bolton's UN nomination. The Republican leadership failed to gain enough support to pass a cloture motion on the floor debate over Bolton, and minority leader Harry Reid conceded the move signaled the \"first filibuster of the year.\" The Democrats claimed that key documents regarding Bolton and his career at the Department of State were being withheld by the Bush administration. Scott McClellan, White House press secretary, responded by saying, \"Just 72 hours after all the good will and bipartisanship (over a deal on judicial nominees), it's disappointing to see the Democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach.\"[114]\nThe failure of the Senate to end debate on Bolton's nomination provided one surprise for some: Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tennessee) voted against cloture for procedural reasons, so he could bring up a cloture vote in the future.[citation needed] (Although Voinovich once spoke against confirming Bolton, he voted for cloture.) Senator John Thune (R-South Dakota) voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against Bolton in the up-or-down vote as a protest against the government's plans to close a military base (Ellsworth) in his home state.\nOn June 20, 2005, the Senate voted again on cloture. The vote failed 54\u201338, six votes short of ending debate. That marked an increase of two \"no\" votes, including the defection of Voinovich, who switched his previous \"yes\" vote and urged President Bush to pick another nominee (Democrats Mark Pryor, Mary Landrieu and Ben Nelson voted to end debate both times). On June 21, Frist expressed his view that attempting another vote would be pointless, but later that day, following a lunch at the White House, changed his position, saying he would continue to push for an up-or-down vote.[citation needed] Voinovich later recanted his opposition and stated that if Bolton were renominated he would have supported the nomination.[115]\n\nAccusations of false statement[edit]\nOn July 28, 2005, it was revealed that a statement made by Bolton on forms submitted to the Senate was false. Bolton indicated that in the prior five years he had not been questioned in any investigation, but in fact he had been interviewed by the State Department's Inspector General as part of an investigation into the sources of pre-war claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. After insisting for weeks that Bolton had testified truthfully on the form, the State Department reversed itself, saying Bolton had simply forgotten about the investigation.[116]\n\nRecess appointment[edit]\nOn August 1, 2005, Bush officially made a recess appointment of Bolton, installing him as Permanent U.S. Representative to the UN. A recess appointment lasts until the next session of Congress ends or until the individual is renominated and confirmed by the Senate. During the announcement, Bush said, \"This post is too important to leave vacant any longer, especially during a war and a vital debate about U.N. reform.\"[117] Democrats criticized the appointment, and Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT) of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said Bolton would lack credibility in the U.N. because he lacked Senate confirmation.[118] U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed Mr. Bolton, but told reporters that the new ambassador should consult with others as the administration continued to press for changes at the United Nations.[119]\n\nTerm at the UN[edit]\nThe Economist called Bolton \"the most controversial ambassador ever sent by America to the United Nations.\" Some colleagues in the UN appreciated the goals Bolton was trying to achieve, but not his abrasive style.[120][121] The New York Times, in its editorial The Shame of the United Nations, praised Bolton's stance on \"reforming the disgraceful United Nations Human Rights Commission\",[122] saying \"John Bolton, is right; Secretary-General Kofi Annan is wrong.\" The Times also said the commission at that time was composed of \"some of the world's most abusive regimes\" who used their membership as cover to continue their abusiveness.\nBolton also opposed the proposed replacement for the Human Rights Commission, the UN Human Rights Council, as not going far enough for reform, saying: \"We want a butterfly. We don't intend to put lipstick on a caterpillar and call it a success.\"[123]\n\n2006 nomination[edit]\nBush announced his intention to renominate Bolton for confirmation as U.N. ambassador at the beginning of 2006, and a new confirmation hearing was held on July 27, 2006, in the hope of completing the process before the expiration of Bolton's recess appointment at the end of the 109th Congress.[124] Voinovich, who had previously stood in opposition to Bolton, had amended his views and determined that Bolton was doing a \"good job\" as UN ambassador; in February 2006, he said \"I spend a lot of time with John on the phone. I think he is really working very constructively to move forward.\"[125]\nOver the summer and during the fall election campaign, no action was taken on the nomination because Chafee, who was in a difficult re-election campaign, blocked a Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote.[citation needed] Without his concurrence, the SFRC would have been deadlocked 9\u20139, and the nomination could not have gone to the Senate floor for a full vote. Bush formally resubmitted the nomination on November 9, 2006, immediately following a midterm election that would give control of the 110th Congress to the Democratic party.[126] Chafee, who had just lost his re-election bid, issued a statement saying he would vote against recommending Bolton for a Senate vote, citing what he considered to be a mandate from the recent election results: \"On Tuesday, the American people sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with the foreign policy approach of the Bush administration. To confirm Mr. Bolton to the position of U.N. ambassador would fly in the face of the clear consensus of the country that a new direction is called for.\"[127]\n\nTermination of service[edit]\nOn December 4, 2006, Bolton announced that he would terminate his work as U.S. representative to the UN at the end of the recess appointment and would not continue to seek confirmation.[128] His letter of resignation from the Bush administration was accepted on December 4, 2006, effective when his recess appointment ended December 9 at the formal adjournment of the 109th Congress.\nThe announcement was characterized as Bolton's \"resignation\" by the Associated Press,[129] United Press International,[130] ABC News,[131] and other news sources, as well as a White House press release[11] and President Bush himself.[132] The White House, however, later objected to the use of this language. Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino told CBS News \"it is not a resignation.\"[133] The actual language of the President's written acceptance was: \"It is with deep regret that I accept John Bolton's decision to end his service in the administration as permanent representative of the United States to the United Nations when his commission expires.\" However, at a press conference, the President said, \"I received the resignation of Ambassador John Bolton. I accept it. I'm not happy about it. I think he deserved to be confirmed.\"[132] Some news organizations subsequently altered their language to phrases such as \"to step down,\" \"to leave,\" or \"to exit.\"[134][135][136]\n\nJohn Bolton in 2008\nSupport for Bolton[edit]\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (March 2018)\nDuring his confirmation hearings in 2005, letters with signatures of more than 64 co-workers and professional colleagues were sent to Senator Richard Lugar, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in praise of Bolton and contradicting other criticisms and allegations concerning his diplomatic style and his treatment of colleagues and staff.[137]\nIn late 2006, when his nomination was again before the committee, another letter signed by professional colleagues supporting the renomination was sent to Senator Lugar.[138] A Wall Street Journal op ed by Claudia Rosett on December 5, 2006, said in part, \"Bolton has been valiant in his efforts to clean up UN corruption and malfeasance, and follow UN procedure in dealing with such threats as a nuclear North Korea, a Hezbollah bid to take over Lebanon, and the nuclearization of Hezbollah's terror-masters in Iran. But it has been like watching one man trying to move a tsunami of mud.\"[citation needed]\n\nNational Security Advisor (2018\u20132019)[edit]\nMay 2, 2018: (from left) Bolton, Mike Pompeo, President Trump, Vice President Pence\nSpeculation on position (2016\u20132017)[edit]\nIn an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Republican nominee Donald Trump named Bolton as a possible choice for Secretary of State. Appearing on Fox News' Fox and Friends on December 1, 2016, Bolton admitted he was being considered as a Secretary of State candidate for the incoming Trump administration.[139][140] Several Trump associates claim Bolton was not chosen, in part, due to Trump's disdain for Bolton's signature mustache.[141]\nThe evening of December 10, the BBC cited NBC reports that \"sources close to Mr Trump [were]\u00a0... saying that Mr Tillerson is likely to be named next week\" and that former UN ambassador John Bolton \"will serve as his deputy\".[142]\nBolton has supported theories about the health of Hillary Clinton and about her aide Huma Abedin, and in December 2016, Bolton said the conclusion of the United States Intelligence Community that Russian hackers had intervened to help elect Donald Trump in 2016 may have been a \"false flag\" operation.[143] In a subsequent interview on Fox News, Bolton criticized the Obama administration's retaliatory sanctions as insufficient and suggested that the US response should \"make them [the Russians] feel pain\".[144][145]\n\nTenure[edit]\nIn February 2017 President Trump interviewed Bolton and three others to determine who would fill the position of National Security Advisor vacated by Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn.[146][147] The position ultimately went to H. R. McMaster.[148] Trump \"made a point on Monday of praising Mr. Bolton and saying that he would find a position for him in his administration eventually.\"[149] Bolton was seen at the White House on the evening of March 6, 2018, presumably to be interviewed as a candidate for national security adviser.[150]\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary James N. Mattis greets the National Security Advisor-designate Bolton at the Pentagon in March 2018\nThe New York Times reported on March 22, 2018, that John Bolton would replace National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, which was confirmed by Trump in a tweet later that day. Bolton began his position as National Security Advisor on April 9, 2018.[151][152] The New York Times wrote that the rise of Bolton and Mike Pompeo, coupled with the departure of Rex Tillerson and General McMaster, meant Trump's foreign policy team was now \"the most radically aggressive foreign policy team around the American president in modern memory\", and compared it to the foreign policy team surrounding George W. Bush, notably with Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.[153]\nOn April 10, 2018, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert resigned at Bolton's request,[154][155] and Bolton said he was considering a merger of the NSC with the Homeland Security Council.[156] During his first week in office Bolton requested and obtained the resignations of multiple National Security Council (NSC) employees including NSC spokesman Michael Anton (April 8), deputy national security adviser Nadia Schadlow (April 10), and deputy national security adviser Ricky L. Waddell (April 12).[156] CNN reported in September 2018 that Bolton had significantly shrunk the number of NSC personnel, cutting it to under 300.[157][158]\nIn April 2018, Bolton pressed President Trump to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Deal, which Trump did a month later.[159]\nThe Huffington Post reported that on May 8, 2018, Bolton removed Timothy Ziemer and dissolved his Global Health Security team formerly on the NSC leaving the administration's high level preparation for and ability to respond to pandemics, infectious disease, and other biological threats unclear.[160] The choice to remove and not replace Ziemer in the midst of an emerging Ebola outbreak in The Democratic Republic of Congo was criticized in several news outlets.[160][161][162][163]\n\nDecember 26, 2018: Bolton and President Trump on the phone with Iraq Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi during visit to U.S. troops\nOn September 10, 2018, in his first major address as National Security Advisor, Bolton criticized the International Criminal Court, saying it lacks checks and balances, exercises \"jurisdiction over crimes that have disputed and ambiguous definitions,\" and has failed to \"deter and punish atrocity crimes.\" Calling the ICC a threat to \"American sovereignty and U.S. national security,\" Bolton said it is \"superfluous,\" given that \"domestic judicial systems already hold American citizens to the highest legal and ethical standards.\" He added that the U.S. would do everything \"to protect our citizens\" should the ICC attempt to prosecute U.S. servicemen over alleged detainee abuse in Afghanistan, and it would bar ICC judges and prosecutors from entering the U.S. and sanction their funds. He also criticized Palestinian efforts to bring Israel before the ICC over allegations of human rights abuses in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.[164][165][166]\nIn 2018, Bolton requested that the Pentagon provide the White House with options for military strikes against Iran. According to the New York Times, Bolton \"intensified the administration's policy of isolating and pressuring Iran\u2014reflecting an animus against Iran's leaders that dates back to his days as an official in the George W. Bush administration. As a private citizen, he later called for military strikes on Iran, as well as regime change.\"[167]\nAs National Security Advisor, Bolton eliminated the kinds of internal policy debates that his predecessor H. R. McMaster had in place. The New York Times writes that this change in practices contributed to Trump's sudden decision to withdraw the United States from Syria in January 2019.[168]\nAs National Security Advisor, Bolton advanced policies skeptical and hostile toward international organizations.[169] By his first year as National Security Advisor, Bolton had reshaped the National Security Council and become influential within the Trump Administration.[170][171][172]\nBy May 2019, Trump had undercut some of Bolton's major hard line positions, stating he was not seeking regime change in Iran and contradicting Bolton's assertion that North Korea had recently violated United Nations resolutions by testing new short-range missiles.[173] As Trump prepared for his historic meeting with Kim Jong-un in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in June 2019, Bolton flew to Mongolia.[174]\n\nIn 2019, John Bolton, then U.S. National Security Advisor meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid (left) at 11 Downing Street\nIn late August 2019, Bolton met Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk, Belarus.[175]\nOn September 10, 2019, President Trump claimed on Twitter that he had told Bolton on September 9 his \"services are no longer needed\" given \"many\" disagreements with Trump, thus Bolton gave his resignation on September 10. Just minutes later, Bolton contradicted Trump's account, tweeting out this claim: Bolton offered to resign on September 9, with Trump replying: \"Let's talk about it tomorrow.\" Bolton later told the media Trump \"never asked\" for his resignation \"directly or indirectly\", and that he had both offered to resign and actually resigned of his own accord. Meanwhile, the White House endorsed Trump's version of the events.[176][177] Politico reported that Tucker Carlson had urged Trump to fire Bolton.[178]\nAfter Bolton's departure, Trump claimed that Bolton's views were \"not necessarily tougher\" than his own: \"in some cases, he thought it was too tough what we were doing\". On Cuba and Venezuela, Trump claimed that his own views were \"far stronger\" than Bolton's: \"He was holding me back!\" Bolton himself was known for his hawkish positions, including on Cuba and Venezuela, while Trump previously in May 2019 offered a different view of Bolton: \"I actually temper John, which is pretty amazing.\"[179][180]\nFollowing his departure, Bolton was reappointed as a senior advisor to investment company Rh\u00f4ne Group, a role he had held previously.[181]\n\nTrump\u2013Ukraine scandal[edit]\nMain article: Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal\nTrump\u2013Ukraine scandalA request by U.S. President Donald Trump (right) to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (left) to investigate Joe Biden and his son sparked the scandal.\nEvents\nList\nPresidency of Donald Trump\n2019 Ukrainian presidential election\nImpeachment inquiry against Donald Trump\nFirst impeachment of Donald Trump\nFirst impeachment trial of Donald Trump\n2020 U.S. presidential election\nForeign interference in the 2020 United States elections\n\nPeople\nWhite House\nPresident Donald Trump\nJohn Bolton\nPam Bondi\nTom Bossert\nPat Cipollone\nFiona Hill\nCharles Kupperman\nMick Mulvaney\nMike Pence\nTony Sayegh\n\nJustice Department\nMichael Atkinson\nWilliam Barr\n\nState Department\nUlrich Brechbuhl\nCatherine Croft\nDavid Hale\nDavid Holmes\nGeorge Kent\nSteve Linick\nMichael McKinley\nMike Pompeo\nPhilip Reeker\nGordon Sondland\nBill Taylor\nKurt Volker\nJennifer Williams\nMarie Yovanovitch\n\nDefense Department\nLaura Cooper\nKathryn L.

He received attention in conservative circles, including the cover of the December 31, 2010, issue of National Review magazine. He told Politico: \"As I survey the situation, I think the Republican field is wide open. I don't think the party's anywhere close to a decision. And stranger things have happened. For example, inexperienced senators from Illinois have gotten presidential nominations.\"[201] In September 2011, Bolton said he would not run for president in 2012.[202]\nDuring the Republican primary, Republican presidential-hopeful Newt Gingrich said he would ask Bolton to serve as his Secretary of State.[203] In January 2012, Bolton endorsed Mitt Romney for the 2012 Republican Nomination.[204]\n\nAmerican Enterprise Institute[edit]\nBolton was senior vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank,[205] from 1997 to 2001. At the time, he frequently wrote columns criticizing the Clinton administration's foreign policy. Bolton said Clinton's policy on Iraq was \"worse than incompetent\", his policy on North Korea was \"egregiously wrong\", and his Libya policy was a \"catastrophic loss of U.S. credibility.\"[60]\nAfter leaving the George W. Bush Administration in 2006, Bolton returned to the American Enterprise Institute as a Senior Fellow. From 2010 until 2018, Bolton served as Director, Foreign and Defense Policy Studies for AEI.[205] In Bolton's time at the American Enterprise Institute, he spoke against the policy of rewarding North Korea for ending its nuclear weapons program. He said the policy would encourage others to violate nuclear non-proliferation rules so they could then be rewarded for following the rules they'd already agreed to.[206]\nIn July 2013, Bolton was identified as a key member of Groundswell, a secretive coalition of right-wing activists and journalists attempting to advance political change behind the scenes through lobbying of high-level contacts.[207]\n\nJohn Bolton Super PAC[edit]\nIn 2013, Bolton set up the John Bolton Super PAC. It raised $11.3 million for Republican candidates in the 2014 and 2016 elections and spent $5.6 million, paying Cambridge Analytica at least $650,000 for voter data analysis and digital video ad targeting in support of the campaigns of Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), and of former U.S. Senator (R-MA) Scott Brown's unsuccessful 2014 bid for a U.S. Senate seat for New Hampshire.[208][209][210] In September 2016, Bolton announced that his Super PAC would spend $1\u00a0million on (R-N.C.) Senator Richard Burr's reelection effort by targeting ads at \"social media users and Dish Network and Direct TV subscribers\".[211]\nThe Center for Public Integrity analysed the John Bolton Super PAC's campaign finance filings and found that they had paid Cambridge Analytica more than $1.1 million since 2014 for \"research\" and \"survey research\".[212] According to Federal Election Commission filings, Cambridge Analytica was paid more than $811,000 by them in the 2016 presidential election;[213] in the same election cycle, the Super PAC spent around $2.5 million in support of Republican U.S. Senate candidates.[212]\nBolton said he aims to raise and spend $25 million for up to 90 Republican candidates in the 2018 midterm elections.[214] In January 2018, Bolton announced a $1 million advertising campaign in support of Kevin Nicholson's bid for the Republican nomination to run against incumbent Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.[214][215] The Super PAC ran an ad campaign in the Green Bay area in January 2018; on March 19, 2018, the Super PAC announced a two-week $278,000 television and radio ad campaign in the Milwaukee area.[216]\nMajor donors to the John Bolton Super PAC are Robert Mercer, who gave $4 million from 2012 to 2016; Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus, and Los Angeles real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer.[208]\nAfter Bolton was appointed National Security Advisor in March 2018, the John Bolton Super PAC and the John Bolton PAC announced that their political activities were suspended temporarily, effective March 31, 2018. The Super PAC's FEC filings showed a balance of $2.6 million in unspent donations at the end of March 2018.[217][218]\n\n2024 presidential election[edit]\nBolton has openly considered the idea of running for president in the 2024 United States presidential election in order to secure the Republican nomination against former President Donald Trump.[219] However, he has yet to fill out FEC filings. Additionally, Bolton has been widely ridiculed for proposing running for president, due to bipartisan opposition to him and his policies.[220][221]\n\nMemoir and legal concerns[edit]\nOn June 16, 2020, the Trump Justice Department attempted to block publication of Bolton's memoir, The Room Where It Happened, seeking to confiscate Bolton's $2 million advance for breach of contract, asserting he had not completed the prepublication security review as he had agreed to receive his security clearance. Bolton had submitted the book for security review in December 2019, and after months of discussions, was told on April 27 by Ellen Knight\u2014the National Security Council's senior director for prepublication review\u2014that no other classification issues remained. However, the White House did not provide Bolton written notice that he could proceed with publication, and in May another NSC official was asked to further review the manuscript.[222] On June 17, the Justice Department asked a federal judge to issue an injunction to block publication of the book, which had already been printed, bound and shipped to distribution warehouses for its official release the following week. By that day, media outlets had acquired copies of the book and begun publishing articles about its contents.\nIn its brief filed with the court, the Justice Department provided six examples of what it asserted were classified items that remained in the book. Trump had previously asserted that any conversation with him is \"highly classified.\" During a hearing on June 19, federal judge Royce Lamberth castigated Bolton for proceeding to publish his book without formal clearance, but ruled that publication of the book could proceed.[223]\nBolton's attorney asserted that the White House was slow-walking the review process to prevent the book, which contained extensive harsh criticism of Trump, from being released during the 2020 election campaign. According to reporting, Trump claimed that the book contained \"highly classified\" information but also characterized the book as \"pure fiction.\"[224][225][226]\nOn June 21, a pirated copy of the book appeared online.[227] The book was released on June 23.[228] Later that summer, the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into whether the book revealed classified information, empaneling a grand jury that subpoenaed the publisher's communications records.[229]\nThe Justice Department dropped its criminal inquiry of Bolton in June 2021 and moved to end efforts to confiscate proceeds from his book.[230]\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nBolton, President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore on June 12, 2018\nBolton with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in September 2018\nHe declared himself in an interview with Edward Luce of the Financial Times in 2007 to be a \"Goldwater conservative\", as opposed to being a neoconservative.[231] He also pointed out that he was a follower of Edmund Burke. He also said \"I have always been a conservative. The idea of big-government conservatism has more neocon adherents than from unmodified conservatives.\"\n\nUnilateralism and Americanism[edit]\nAmericanism is Bolton's core belief, according to The New York Times:\n\nLong before Mr. Trump popularized his \"America First\" slogan, Mr. Bolton termed himself an \"Americanist\" who prioritized a cold-eyed view of national interests and sovereignty over what they both saw as a starry-eyed fixation on democracy promotion and human rights. They shared a deep skepticism of globalism and multilateralism, a commonality that empowered Mr. Bolton to use his time in the White House to orchestrate the withdrawal of the United States from arms control treaties and other international agreements.[232]\nBolton is skeptical of international organizations and international law, believing them to endanger American sovereignty, and does not believe they have legitimate authority under the U.S. Constitution.[233][234] He criticized the Obama administration's foreign policy for what he perceived as surrendering U.S. sovereignty.[235] He also prefers unilateralism over multilateralism.[233] In a 2000 article in the Chicago Journal of International Law, Bolton described himself as a \"convinced Americanist\", favoring it over what he described as \"globalism\".[236] In his roles in the U.S. government, however, Bolton has been more pragmatic in his actions toward international organizations,[237] though according to Foreign Policy, he effectively advanced his views on this subject during his tenure in the Trump Administration.[169]\nBolton has criticized the International Criminal Court, seeing it as a threat to U.S. sovereignty.[238] Bolton said: \"If the court comes after us, Israel or other US allies, we will not sit quietly. We will ban its judges and prosecutors from entering the United States. We will sanction their funds in the US financial system, and we will prosecute them in the US criminal system.\"[239]\n\nViews on the United Nations[edit]\nAmbassador Bolton briefing on \"The Human Rights Commission and UN Management Reform\" at the New York Foreign Press Center\nBolton has been a strong critic of the United Nations for much of his career.[240] Bolton's opposition to the UN was rooted in a disdain for international organizations, which he believed infringed on the sovereignty of the United States.[241][242] He also opposed the International Criminal Court.[241][242] In 1994, he stated, \"There is no United Nations. There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that's the United States, when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along.\"[243]\nHe also stated that \"The Secretariat Building in New York has 38 stories. If you lost ten stories today, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\"[244] When pressed on the statement during the confirmation process, he responded, \"There's not a bureaucracy in the world that couldn't be made leaner.\"[245] However, in a paper on U.S. participation in the UN, Bolton stated \"the United Nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of American foreign policy.\"[246]\n\nEuropean Union[edit]\nBolton is a critic of the European Union. In his book Surrender Is Not an Option, he criticized the EU for pursuing \"the endless process of diplomatic mastication\" rather than satisfactorily solving problems, and he labeled the organization's diplomats as \"EUroids\".[247] He has also criticized the EU for advancing what he considers liberal policies.[248] Bolton campaigned in Ireland against further EU integration in 2008, and he criticized the Treaty of Lisbon for expanding EU powers.[249] In 2016, Bolton praised the UK's referendum vote to leave the EU,[250] and Axios reported in January 2019 that Bolton continued to advocate for a hard Brexit as National Security Advisor.[251] In a March 2019 interview with Sky News, Bolton criticized the UK \"political class\" for not implementing the Brexit vote.[252]\n\nBolton, President Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, December 1, 2018\nTargeted killings of terrorist leaders[edit]\nIn September 2011, when the Obama administration declared the death of Al Qaeda target and American-born radical Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, Bolton commented \"I think it's important as individual Al Qaeda figures and other terrorists are killed that we not read more into it than there is. Consider this analogy if you were around in the 1920s and somebody said, my God, Vladimir Lenin is dead. The Bolsheviks will never recover from this...So while Al-Awlaki's death is significant, I would not read cosmic consequences into it.\"[253]\n\nLibya[edit]\nBolton opposed the deal that George W. Bush made with then Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to eliminate the country's weapons of mass destruction program.[23] He was in a key role during initial negotiations but his role became limited over time. According to a 2005 study, Bolton was intentionally kept out of the loop so a final agreement could be reached: \"Bolton reportedly was unaware of the December 19 WMD agreement until very shortly before its public announcement. And after initially being given a lead role in implementing it, he pushed so hard to backtrack from the agreement that the British convinced the Bush administration to restrict his involvement in the Libya matter.\"[23]\nBolton supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya that toppled the regime of Muammar Gaddafi.[254][255]\n\nIraq[edit]\nBolton is regarded to be an \"architect\" of the Iraq War.[256][257][258] In 1998, he was a signatory to a letter sent to President Bill Clinton urging him to remove Saddam Hussein from power using U.S. diplomatic, political and military power.[259] He supported the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein and continued to stand by his support of the invasion by 2018.[260][261] In 2007, Bolton said the only mistake the United States made with regard to Iraq was to not leave earlier after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and tell the Iraqis \"Here's a copy of the Federalist Papers. Good luck.\"[262]\n\nKosovo[edit]\nDuring 2008, Bolton opposed the declaration of independence by Kosovo.[263] In 2018 he said, \"US policy is that if the two parties can work it out between themselves and reach agreement, we don't exclude territorial adjustments,\" and that the US or Europe would not \"stand in the way if the two parties to the dispute reached a mutually satisfactory settlement.\"[263]\n\nIsrael[edit]\nBolton greeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in August 2018\nBolton with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin in August 2018\nPresident Trump, joined by Bolton and Netanyahu behind, signs the proclamation recognizing Israel's 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights, March 25, 2019\nBolton is known for his strong support for Israel.[264][265] Bolton opposes the two-state solution of creating an independent Palestinian state alongside the existing state of Israel.[266] Bolton supported moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in accordance with the Jerusalem Embassy Act,[267] and he testified in front of Congress in 2017 on the matter.[268] In 2010, Bolton co-founded the Friends of Israel Initiative with 12 other international figures.[269]\nBolton supports what he calls the \"Three State Solution\" in order to determine the political status of Gaza and the West Bank. Under Bolton's Three State Solution, Israel would annex settlements it has built in the West Bank since the conclusion of the Six-Days War in 1967, Egypt would annex and administer the Gaza Strip, and Jordan would annex and administer the remaining portion of the West Bank not annexed by Israel. Bolton's Three State proposal would not result in the creation of an independent Palestinian state.[270]\n\nNorth Korea and Iran[edit]\nBolton has advocated for pre-emptive strikes against North Korea and Iran. In March 2018, he suggested that South Korea take North Korea and terminate the North Korean regime as the only \"diplomatic option\", and said that the war between the two countries is their problem and not the United States' problem.[271]\nIn 2006, Bolton attempted to bring prosecution against Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for incitement to genocide in the International Court of Justice, along with Alan Dershowitz, Dore Gold, and other experts from the United States, Canada, and Israel, based on Ahmadinejad's comments that \"Israel must be wiped off the map\".[272]\nIn 2008, Bolton said: \"The idea here is not to have much larger hostilities, but to stop the Iranians from engaging in the hostilities that they're already doing against us inside Iraq. And they're doing much the same by aiding the Taliban in Afghanistan. So this is not provocative or preemptive, this is entirely responsive on our part.\"[271] In 2018, Bolton stated: \"Russia, China, Syria, Iran, North Korea. These are regimes that make agreements and lie about them. A national security policy that is based on the faith that regimes like that will honor their commitments is doomed to failure.\"[273] He also said, \"Our goal should be regime change in Iran.\"[266] The New Yorker, described the people who have worked with Bolton as saying \"he is focused less on North Korea than on Iran\". H. R. McMaster has reportedly told Dexter Fikins that Bolton has had \"[the] anal focus on Iran for twenty years\".[274]\nUnlike several of President Trump's early national security officials like National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Bolton campaigned to press President Trump for a complete withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran (the JCPOA) and rejected the idea it could be fixed. Unable at the time to directly present his position to President Trump, Bolton published his proposal on how to withdraw from the Iran deal in an August 28, 2017 National Review Online article.[275] After he was named to succeed McMaster as Nation Security Adviser in April 2018, Bolton pressed the President to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, a decision President Trump announced a month later.[159] Bolton has been one of the biggest anti-Iran hawks in the Trump administration.[276]\nSpeaking to a meeting of Iranian exile group Mujahedin-e-Khalq in March 2018, Bolton said the Trump administration should follow the goal of regime change in Iran and that \"before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!\"[277]\nIn 2019, Bolton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo successfully sabotaged Trump's attempts to open diplomatic channels with Iran.[278][279]\nOn January 3, 2020, the high-level Iranian General, Qasem Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. drone strike, which considerably heightened the existing tensions between the two countries. In a tweet, Bolton called the airstrike a \"long in the making, this was a decisive blow against Iran's malign Quds Force activities worldwide. Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran.\"[280]\n\nPeople's Mujahedin of Iran[edit]\nPrior to it being de-listed by the U.S. as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2012, Bolton spoke in favor of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (also known as the Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK), in at least one case being paid to do so. MEK has opposed the Iranian theocratic state since shortly after the 1979 Iranian Revolution.[281] They also have a long history of criticism of and opposition to U.S. policy in the region.[282][283][284] According to the State Department, the MEK \"[f]ollow[s] a philosophy that mixes Marxism and Islam.\"[284]\nAccording to his financial disclosure, he was given $40,000 for his 2016 speech to MEK.[274] According to the 5 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 101-required 'US Public Financial Disclosure Report' (2018) for Bolton, released by Al-Monitor, he has received $40,000 of speaking fee for \"Global Events\u2013European Iranian Events\" on June 1, 2017,[285] the same day he made a speech for the MEK in a gathering in Paris, France.[286][287][288] In May 2018, Joanne Stocker, a journalist and researcher studying the MEK, told Richard Engel of MSNBC that she estimates Bolton was paid \"on the low-end, $180,000\". Bolton's office has refused to comment on the matter.[289]\n\nRussia[edit]\nBolton meets with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu in Moscow in October 2018\nIn 2013, after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden had been granted asylum in Russia, Bolton said: \"I think in order to focus Putin's thinking, we need to do things that cause him pain as well. And while I know that not having a chance to have a bilateral meeting with his buddy Barack Obama will cause Putin to lose sleep, it's not damaging Russian interests.\"[273]\nRussian Senator Aleksey Pushkov, former chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, said after Bolton's appointment: \"Bolton, along with Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld, was an ardent supporter of the war in Iraq. A supporter of jihadists for the sake of overthrowing [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad]. A great specialist in interventions and aggression, and adept at the use of force. McMaster is a general. Bolton is the ideologue of a new cold war, a convinced opponent of Russia.\"[290]\nIn a June 2017 article entitled \"Vladimir Putin looked Trump in the eye and lied to him. We negotiate with Russia at our peril,\" Bolton called Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections \"a true act of war.\"[291] As Trump's national security advisor in July 2018, Bolton referred to the investigation into the Russian interference as \"the Russia witch hunt\".[292]\nIn a December 2021 article entitled \"Now Is the Time for NATO to Stand Up to Russia,\" Bolton called for an aggressive response to Moscow's troops build-up along the Ukraine border, before the full-scale invasion commenced in February 2022.[293]\nOn July 6, 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden approved the provision of cluster munitions to Ukraine.[294] Bolton hailed the decision as \"an excellent idea\".[295]\n\nChina[edit]\nBolton, President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit in Osaka, June 28, 2019\nIn 2018, Bolton criticized Washington's One-China policy, under which Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, is not recognized as an independent nation, with recognition being given only to the People's Republic of China.[264]\nOn China's notoriety in intellectual property matters, he remarked in 2018 that \"There's simply no excuse for the stealing of intellectual property, forced technology transfers it's sometimes called.\"[264]\nBolton said in October 2018 that the United States' need to counter a Chinese arms buildup in the Pacific, including within South China Sea, was one of the reasons for their move to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, because China is not a signatory to the treaty.[296][297]\n\nLatin America[edit]\nBolton with Brazil's president-elect Jair Bolsonaro in Rio de Janeiro in November 2018\nIn a speech as National Security Advisor on November 1, 2018, Bolton praised Brazil's president-elect Jair Bolsonaro and Colombia's president Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, both right-wing conservatives, calling them \"like-minded\" partners. In the speech, he also framed Bolsonaro's election victory as a \"positive sign\" for Latin America, and he criticized Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as a \"troika of tyranny.\"[298][299][300][301]\n\nCriticism of the Obama administration[edit]\nIn December 2012, Bolton suggested that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had faked a concussion to avoid testifying before Congress regarding the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Bolton stated \"When you don't want to go to a meeting or conference or an event you have a 'diplomatic illness'. And this is a diplomatic illness to beat the band.\"[302][303][304]\nIn 2010, he wrote a foreword for the book The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on America, authored by far-right anti-Muslim commentators Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer.[305][306] Bolton endorsed their book, writing: \"This book carries forward the ongoing and increasingly widespread critique of Barack Obama as our first post-American president. What it recounts is disturbing, and its broader implications are more disturbing still.\"[307]\n\nIRGC murder plot[edit]\nOn August 10, 2022, an Iranian national and member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Shahram Poursafi, was charged by the United States Department of Justice in an October 2021 plot to murder Bolton, likely in retaliation for the January 2020 death of Qasem Soleimani.[308][309] In response to the plot, Bolton was granted a protective detail from the United States Secret Service on the orders of President Joe Biden.[310]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBolton married Christina Bolton in 1972; they divorced in 1983.[311] He has been married to Gretchen Smith Bolton, a financial planner with AXA Advisors, since January 1986.[311] She was born in Kansas City in 1945 and had been married once before, divorcing in 1973. Together they have a daughter, Jennifer, and have resided in Bethesda, Maryland since 1986.[312][313] Bolton identifies as a Lutheran.[314]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nSurrender Is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad.

He participated in the 1960 Nashville sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, was the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) from 1963 to 1966, and was one of the \"Big Six\" leaders of groups who organized the 1963 March on Washington. Fulfilling many key roles in the civil rights movement and its actions to end legalized racial segregation in the United States, in 1965 Lewis led the first of three Selma to Montgomery marches across the Edmund Pettus Bridge where, in an incident which became known as Bloody Sunday, state troopers and police attacked Lewis and the other marchers.\nA member of the Democratic Party, Lewis was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1986 and served 17 terms. The district he represented included most of Atlanta. Due to his length of service, he became the dean of the Georgia congressional delegation. Lewis was one of the leaders of the Democratic Party in the House, serving from 1991 as a chief deputy whip and from 2003 as a senior chief deputy whip. He received many honorary degrees and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nJohn Robert Lewis was born near Troy, Alabama, on February 21, 1940, the third of ten children of Willie Mae (n\u00e9e Carter) and Eddie Lewis.[2][3][4] His parents were sharecroppers in rural Pike County, Alabama, of which Troy was the county seat.[5][6]\nAs a boy, Lewis aspired to be a preacher,[7] and at age five, he preached to his family's chickens on the farm.[8] As a young child, Lewis had little interaction with white people, as his county was majority black by a large percentage and his family worked as farmers. By the time he was six, Lewis had seen only two white people in his life.[9] Lewis recalls \"I grew up in rural Alabama, very poor, very few books in our home.\"[10] He describes his early education at a little school, walking distances from his home. \"A beautiful little building, it was a  Rosenwald School. It was supported by the community, it was the only school we had.\"[11] \"I had a wonderful teacher in elementary school, and she told me 'read my child, read!' And I tried to read everything. I loved books. I remember in 1956, when I was 16 years old, with some of my brothers and sisters and cousins, going down to the public library, trying to get a library card, and we were told the library was for whites only and not for coloureds.\"[12] As he grew older, he began taking trips into Troy with his family, where he continued to have experiences of racism and segregation.[13][14][15] Lewis had relatives who lived in northern cities, and he learned from them that in the North schools, buses, and businesses were integrated. When Lewis was 11, an uncle took him to Buffalo, New York, where he became acutely aware of the contrast with Troy's segregation.[16]\nIn 1955, Lewis first heard Martin Luther King Jr. on the radio,[17] and he closely followed King's Montgomery bus boycott later that year.[18] At age 15, Lewis preached his first public sermon.[8] At 17, Lewis met Rosa Parks, notable for her role in the bus boycott, and met King for the first time at the age of 18.[19] In later years, Lewis also credited evangelist Billy Graham, a friend of King's, as someone who \"helped change me\".[20][21] Lewis also stated that Graham inspired him \"to a significant degree\" to fulfill his aspirations of becoming a minister.[20][21]\nAfter writing to King about being denied admission to Troy University in Alabama, Lewis was invited to meet with him. King, who referred to Lewis as \"the boy from Troy\", discussed suing the university for discrimination, but he warned Lewis that doing so could endanger his family in Troy. After discussing it with his parents, Lewis decided instead to proceed with his education at a small, historically black college in Tennessee.[22]\nLewis graduated from the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, Tennessee, and was ordained as a Baptist minister.[8][7] He then earned a bachelor's degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University, also a historically black college. He was a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.[23][24]\n\nStudent activism and SNCC[edit]\nNashville Student Movement[edit]\nCivil rights leaders meet with President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson after the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, 1963. Lewis is fourth from left.\nAs a student, Lewis became an activist in the civil rights movement. He organized sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Nashville and took part in many other civil rights activities as part of the Nashville Student Movement. The Nashville sit-in movement was responsible for the desegregation of lunch counters in the city's downtown. Lewis was arrested and jailed many times during the nonviolent activities to desegregate the city's downtown businesses.[25] He was also instrumental in organizing bus boycotts and other nonviolent protests to support voting rights and racial equality.[26]\nDuring this time, Lewis said it was important to engage in \"good trouble, necessary trouble\" in order to achieve change, and he held to this credo throughout his life.[27]\nWhile a student, Lewis was invited to attend nonviolence workshops held at Clark Memorial United Methodist Church by the Rev. James Lawson and Rev. Kelly Miller Smith. Lewis and other students became dedicated to the discipline and philosophy of nonviolence, which he practiced for the rest of his life.[28]\n\nFreedom Riders[edit]\nVideo of President Clinton delivering remarks at a dinner honoring Representative John Lewis\nIn 1961, Lewis became one of the 13 original Freedom Riders.[5][29] The group of seven blacks and six whites planned to ride on interstate buses from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans to challenge the policies of Southern states along the route that had imposed segregated seating on the buses, violating federal policy for interstate transportation. The Freedom Ride, originated by the Fellowship of Reconciliation and revived by James Farmer and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), was initiated to pressure the federal government to enforce the Supreme Court decision in Boynton v. Virginia (1960) that declared segregated interstate bus travel to be unconstitutional. The Freedom Rides revealed the passivity of local, state and federal governments in the face of violence against law-abiding citizens.[30] The project was publicized; and organizers had notified the Department of Justice about it. It depended on the Alabama police to protect the riders, although the state was known for notorious racism. It did not undertake actions except assigning FBI agents to record incidents. After extreme violence broke out in South Carolina and Alabama, the Kennedy Administration called for a cooling-off period, with a moratorium on Freedom Rides.[31]\nIn the South, Lewis and other nonviolent Freedom Riders were beaten by angry mobs and arrested. At age 21, Lewis was the first of the Freedom Riders to be assaulted while in Rock Hill, South Carolina. When he tried to, a whites-only waiting room, two white men attacked him, injuring his face and kicking him in the ribs. Two weeks later Lewis joined a \"Freedom Ride\" bound for Jackson, Mississippi. Near the end of his life, Lewis said of this time, \"We were determined not to let any act of violence keep us from our goal. We knew our lives could be threatened, but we had made up our minds not to turn back.\"[32] As a result of his Freedom Rider activities, Lewis was imprisoned for 40 days in the notorious Mississippi State Penitentiary in Sunflower County.[33]\nIn an interview with CNN during the 40th anniversary of the Freedom Rides, Lewis recounted the violence he and the 12 other original Freedom Riders endured. In Birmingham, the Riders were beaten by an unrestrained mob including KKK members (notified of their arrival by police) with baseball bats, chains, lead pipes, and stones. The police arrested them, and led them across the border into Tennessee before letting them go. The Riders reorganized and rode to Montgomery, where they were met with more violence.[34] There Lewis was hit in the head with a wooden crate. \"It was very violent. I thought I was going to die. I was left lying at the Greyhound bus station in Montgomery unconscious\", said Lewis, remembering the incident.[35]\nWhen CORE gave up on the Freedom Ride because of the violence, Lewis and fellow activist Diane Nash arranged for Nashville students from Fisk and other colleges to take it over and bring it to a successful conclusion.[36][37]\nIn February 2009, 48 years after the Montgomery attack, Lewis received a nationally televised apology from Elwin Wilson, a white southerner and former Klansman.[38][39]\nLewis wrote in 2015 that he had known the young activists Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman from New York. They, along with James Chaney, a local African-American activist from Mississippi, were abducted and murdered in June 1964 in Neshoba County, Mississippi, by members of the Ku Klux Klan including law enforcement.[40]\n\nSNCC Chairman[edit]\nExternal videos \u201cInterview with John Lewis\u201d pt.1 conducted in 1979 for America, They Loved You Madly, a precursor to Eyes on the Prize in which he discusses the sit-ins in Nashville, the philosophy of non-violence, the Freedom Rides, his role in SNCC, and the March on Washington.\nSee also: Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Big Six (activists)Leaders of the March on Washington, 1963. Lewis is second from right.\nIn 1963, when Charles McDew stepped down as chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Lewis, a founding member, was elected to take over.[41][42] Lewis's experience was already widely respected. His courage and tenacious adherence to the philosophy of reconciliation and nonviolence had enabled him to emerge as a leader. He had already been arrested 24 times in the nonviolent movement for equal justice.[43] As chairman of SNCC, Lewis was one of the \"Big Six\" leaders who were organizing the March on Washington that summer. The youngest,[44] he was scheduled as the fourth to speak, ahead of the final speaker, Dr. Martin Luther King. Other leaders were Whitney Young, A. Philip Randolph, James Farmer, and Roy Wilkins.\nLewis had written a response to Kennedy's 1963 Civil Rights Bill. Lewis and his fellow SNCC workers had suffered from the federal government's passivity in the face of Southern violence.[31] He planned to denounce Kennedy's bill for failing to provide protection for African Americans against police brutality, or to provide African Americans with the means to vote; he described the bill as \"too little and too late\". But when copies of the speech were distributed on August 27, the other chairs of the march insisted that it be revised. James Forman re-wrote Lewis's speech on a portable typewriter in a small anteroom behind Lincoln's statue during the program. He replaced Lewis's initial assertion \"we cannot support, wholeheartedly the [Kennedy] civil rights bill\u201d with \u201cWe support it with great reservations.\"[45]\nAfter Lewis, Dr. King gave his now celebrated \"I Have a Dream\" speech.[46][47][48] Historian Howard Zinn later wrote of this occasion:\n\nAt the great Washington March of 1963, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), John Lewis, speaking to the same enormous crowd that [next] heard King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, was prepared to ask the right question: 'Which side is the federal government on?' That sentence was eliminated from his speech by the other organizers of the March to avoid offending the Kennedy Administration.Lewis in 1964In 1964, SNCC opened Freedom Schools, launched the Mississippi Freedom Summer for voter education and registration.[49] Lewis coordinated SNCC's efforts for Freedom Summer, a campaign to register black voters in Mississippi and to engage college student activists in aiding the campaign. Lewis traveled the country, encouraging students to spend their summer break trying to help people vote in Mississippi, which had the lowest number of black voters and strong resistance to the movement.[50]\nIn 1965 Lewis organized some of the voter registration efforts during the 1965 Selma voting rights campaign, and became nationally known during his prominent role in the Selma to Montgomery marches.[51] On March 7, 1965 \u2013 a day that would become known as \"Bloody Sunday\" \u2013 Lewis and fellow activist Hosea Williams led over 600 marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. At the end of the bridge and the city-county boundary, they were met by Alabama State Troopers who ordered them to disperse. When the marchers stopped to pray, the police discharged tear gas and mounted troopers charged the demonstrators, beating them with nightsticks. Lewis's skull was fractured, but he was aided in escaping across the bridge to Brown Chapel, a church in Selma that served as the movement's headquarters.[52] Lewis bore scars on his head from this incident for the rest of his life.[53]\nLewis served as SNCC chairman until 1966, when he was replaced by Stokely Carmichael.[54][55]\n\nField Foundation, SRC, and VEP (1966\u20131977)[edit]\nIn 1966, Lewis moved to New York City to take a job as the associate director of the Field Foundation.[56][57] He was there a little over a year before moving back to Atlanta to direct the Southern Regional Council's Community Organization Project.[58][57] During his time with the SRC, he completed his degree from Fisk University.[59]\nIn 1970, Lewis became the director of the Voter Education Project (VEP), a position he held until 1977.[60] Though initially a project of the Southern Regional Council, the VEP became an independent organization in 1971.[61] Despite difficulties caused by the 1973\u20131975 recession,[61] the VEP added nearly four million minority voters to the rolls under Lewis's leadership.[62] During his tenure, the VEP expanded its mission, including running Voter Mobilization Tours.[61]\n\nEarly work in government (1977\u20131986)[edit]\nLewis with President Jimmy Carter in 1979\nIn January 1977, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Andrew Young of Georgia's 5th congressional district resigned to become the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. under President Jimmy Carter. In the March 1977 open primary, Atlanta City Councilman Wyche Fowler ranked first with 40% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold to win outright. Lewis ranked second with 29% of the vote.[63] In the April election, Fowler defeated Lewis 62%\u201338%.[64]\nAfter his unsuccessful bid, Lewis accepted a position with the Carter administration as associate director of ACTION, responsible for running the VISTA program, the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, and the Foster Grandparent Program. He held that job for two and a half years, resigning as the 1980 election approached.[65]\nIn 1981, Lewis ran for an at-large seat on the Atlanta City Council. He won with 69% of the vote,[66] and served on the council until 1986.[67]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives[edit]\nElections[edit]\n1986[edit]\nLewis greets President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan in 1987.\nAfter nine years as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Wyche Fowler gave up the seat to make a successful run for the U.S. Senate. Lewis decided to run for the 5th district again. In the August Democratic primary, where a victory was considered tantamount to election, State Representative Julian Bond ranked first with 47%, just three points shy of winning outright. Lewis finished in second place with 35%.[68] In the run-off, Lewis pulled an upset against Bond, defeating him 52% to 48%.[69] The race was said to have \"badly strained relations in Atlanta's black community\" as many Black leaders had supported Bond over Lewis.[70] Lewis was \"endorsed by the Atlanta newspapers and a favorite of the white liberal establishment\".[71] His victory was due to strong results among white voters (a minority in the district).[71] During the campaign, he ran advertisements accusing Bond of corruption, implying that Bond used cocaine, and suggesting that Bond had lied about his civil rights activism.[71]\nIn the November general election, Lewis defeated Republican Portia Scott 75% to 25%.[72]\n\n1988\u20132018[edit]\nLewis was reelected 18 times, dropping below 70 percent of the vote in the general election only once in 1994, when he defeated Republican Dale Dixon by a 38-point margin, 69%\u201331%.[73] He ran unopposed in 1996,[74] 2004,[75] 2006,[76] and 2008,[77] and again in 2014 and 2018.[78][79]\nHe was challenged in the Democratic primary just twice: in 1992 and 2008. In 1992, he defeated State Representative Mable Thomas 76%\u201324%.[80] In 2008, Thomas decided to challenge Lewis again; Markel Hutchins also contested the race. Lewis defeated Hutchins and Thomas 69%\u201316%\u201315%.[81]\n\nTenure[edit]\nOverview[edit]\nAn official portrait of Lewis\nLewis represented Georgia's 5th congressional district, one of the most consistently Democratic districts in the nation. Since its formalization in 1845, the district has been represented by a Democrat for most of its history.\nLewis was one of the most liberal congressmen to have represented a district in the Deep South. He was categorized as a \"Hard-Core Liberal\" by On the Issues.[82] The Washington Post described Lewis in 1998 as \"a fiercely partisan Democrat but ... also fiercely independent\".[83] Lewis characterized himself as a strong and adamant liberal.[83] The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said Lewis was the \"only former major civil rights leader who extended his fight for human rights and racial reconciliation to the halls of Congress\".[84] The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also said that to \"those who know him, from U.S. senators to 20-something congressional aides\", he is called the \"conscience of Congress\".[84] Lewis cited Florida Senator and later Representative Claude Pepper, a staunch liberal, as being the colleague whom he most admired.[85] Lewis also spoke out in support of gay rights and national health insurance.[83]\nLewis opposed the 1991 Gulf War,[86][87] and the 2000 U.S. trade agreement with China that passed the House.[88] He opposed the Clinton administration on NAFTA and welfare reform.[83] After welfare reform passed, Lewis was described as outraged; he said, \"Where is the sense of decency? What does it profit a great nation to conquer the world, only to lose its soul?\"[89] In 1994, when Clinton considered invading Haiti, Lewis opposed armed intervention.[90] After a non-violent transition of power was negotiated, Lewis supported the presence of U.S. troops in Haiti as part of Operation Uphold Democracy, calling the operation a \"mission of peace\".[91][92] In 1998, when Clinton was considering a military strike against Iraq, Lewis said he would back the president if American forces were ordered into action.[93] In 2001, three days after the September 11 attacks, Lewis voted to give President George W. Bush authority to use force against the perpetrators of 9/11 in a vote that was 420\u20131; Lewis called it probably one of his toughest votes.[94] In 2002, he sponsored the Peace Tax Fund bill, a conscientious objection to military taxation initiative that had been reintroduced yearly since 1972.[95] Lewis was a \"fierce partisan critic of President Bush\", and an early opponent of the Iraq War.[84][96] The Associated Press said he was \"the first major House figure to suggest impeaching George W. Bush\", arguing that the president \"deliberately, systematically violated the law\" in authorizing the National Security Agency to conduct wiretaps without a warrant. Lewis said, \"He is not king, he is president.\"[97]\nLewis drew on his historical involvement in the Civil Rights Movement as part of his politics. He made an annual pilgrimage to Alabama to retrace the route he marched in 1965 from Selma to Montgomery\u00a0\u2013 a route Lewis worked to make part of the Historic National Trails program. That trip became \"one of the hottest tickets in Washington among lawmakers, Republican and Democrat, eager to associate themselves with Lewis and the movement. 'We don't deliberately set out to win votes, but it's very helpful\", Lewis said of the trip'.\"[84][98] In recent years, however, Faith and Politics Institute drew criticism for selling seats on the trip to lobbyists for at least $25,000 each. According to the Center for Public Integrity, even Lewis said that he would feel \"much better\" if the institute's funding came from churches and foundations instead of corporations.[99]\nOn June 3, 2011, the House passed a resolution 268\u2013145, calling for a withdrawal of the United States military from the air and naval operations in and around Libya.[100] Lewis voted against the resolution.[101]\nIn a 2002 op-ed, Lewis mentioned a response by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to an anti-Zionist student at a 1967 Harvard meeting, quoting \"When people criticize Zionists they mean Jews, you are talking anti-Semitism.\" In describing the special relationship between African Americans and American Jews in working for liberation and peace, he also gave other statements by King to the same effect, including one from March 25, 1968: \"Peace for Israel means security, and we must stand with all our might to protect its right to exist, its territorial integrity. I see Israel as one of the great outposts of democracy in the world, and a marvelous example of what can be done, how desert land can be transformed into an oasis of brotherhood and democracy. Peace for Israel means security and that security must be a reality.\"[102]\nLewis \"strongly disagreed\" with the movement for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel and co-sponsored resolution condemning the pro-Palestinian group, but he supported Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib's House resolution opposing U.S. anti-boycott legislation banning the boycott of Israel. He explained his support as \"a simple demonstration of my ongoing commitment to the ability of every American to exercise the fundamental First Amendment right to protest through nonviolent actions\".[103]\n\nProtests[edit]\nIn January 2001, Lewis boycotted the inauguration of George W. Bush by staying in his Atlanta district. He did not attend the swearing-in because he did not believe Bush was the true elected president.[104] Later, Lewis joined 30 other House Democrats who voted to not count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.[105]\nIn March 2003, Lewis spoke to a crowd of 30,000 in Oregon during an anti-war protest before the start of the Iraq War.[106] In 2006[107] and 2009 he was arrested for protesting against the genocide in Darfur outside the Sudanese embassy.[108] He was one of eight U.S. Representatives, from six states, arrested while holding a sit-in near the west side of the U.S. Capitol building, to advocate for immigration reform.[109]\n\n2008 presidential election[edit]\nLewis speaks during the final day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado\nAt first, Lewis supported Hillary Clinton, endorsing her presidential campaign on October 12, 2007.[110] On February 14, 2008, however, he announced he was considering withdrawing his support from Clinton and might instead cast his superdelegate vote for Barack Obama: \"Something is happening in America and people are prepared and ready to make that great leap.\"[111] Ben Smith of Politico said that \"it would be a seminal moment in the race if John Lewis were to switch sides.\"[112]\nOn February 27, 2008, Lewis formally changed his support and endorsed Obama.[113][114] After Obama clinched the Democratic nomination for president, Lewis said \"If someone had told me this would be happening now, I would have told them they were crazy, out of their mind, they didn't know what they were talking about ... I just wish the others were around to see this day. ... To the people who were beaten, put in jail, were asked questions they could never answer to register to vote, it's amazing.\"[115] Despite switching his support to Obama, Lewis drew criticism from his constituents for his support of Clinton for several months. One of his challengers in the House primary election set up campaign headquarters inside the building that served as Obama's Georgia office.[116]\nIn October 2008, Lewis issued a statement criticizing the presidential campaign of John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin and accusing them of \"sowing the seeds of hatred and division\" in a way that brought to mind the late Gov. George Wallace and \"another destructive period\" in American political history. McCain said he was \"saddened\" by the criticism from \"a man I've always admired\", and called on Obama to repudiate Lewis's statement. Obama responded to the statement, saying that he \"does not believe that John McCain or his policy criticism is in any way comparable to George Wallace or his segregationist policies\".[117] Lewis later issued a follow-up statement clarifying that he had not compared McCain and Palin to Wallace himself, but rather that his earlier statement was a \"reminder to all Americans that toxic language can lead to destructive behavior\".[118]\n\nOn an African American being elected president, he said:If you ask me whether the election ... is the fulfillment of Dr. King's dream, I say, 'No, it's just a down payment.' There's still too many people 50 years later, there's still too many people that are being left out and left behind.[119]After Obama's swearing-in ceremony as president, Lewis asked him to sign a commemorative photograph of the event. Obama signed it, \"Because of you, John. Barack Obama.\"[120]\n2016 firearm safety legislation sit-in[edit]\nHouse Democrats, led by Lewis, take the floor to begin a sit-in demanding gun safety legislation on June 22, 2016\nOn June 22, 2016, House Democrats, led by Lewis and Massachusetts Representative Katherine Clark, began a sit-in demanding House Speaker Paul Ryan allow a vote on gun-safety legislation in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub shooting. Speaker pro tempore Daniel Webster ordered the House into recess, but Democrats refused to leave the chamber for nearly 26 hours.[121]\n\nNational African American Museum[edit]\nIn 1988, the year after he was sworn into Congress, Lewis introduced a bill to create a national African American museum in Washington. The bill failed, and for 15 years he continued to introduce it with each new Congress. Each time it was blocked in the Senate, most often by conservative Southern Senator Jesse Helms. In 2003, Helms retired. The bill won bipartisan support, and President George W. Bush signed the bill to establish the museum, with the Smithsonian's Board of Regents to establish the location. The National Museum of African American History and Culture, located adjacent to the Washington Monument, held its opening ceremony on September 25, 2016.[122]\n\n2016 presidential election[edit]\nJohn Lewis at the 2017 Women's March in Atlanta\nLewis supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries against Bernie Sanders. Regarding Sanders' role in the civil rights movement, Lewis remarked \"To be very frank, I never saw him, I never met him. I chaired the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for three years, from 1963 to 1966. I was involved in sit-ins, in the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the March from Selma to Montgomery\u00a0... but I met Hillary Clinton\". Former Congressman and Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie wrote a letter to Lewis expressing his disappointment with Lewis's comments about Sanders. Lewis later clarified his statement, saying \"During the late 1950s and 1960s when I was more engaged, [Sanders] was not there. I did not see him around. I have never seen him in the South. But if he was there, if he was involved someplace, I was not aware of it\u00a0... The fact that I did not meet him in the movement does not mean I doubted that Senator Sanders participated in the civil rights movement, neither was I attempting to disparage his activism.\"[123][124][125]\nIn a January 2016 interview, Lewis compared Donald Trump, then the Republican front-runner for the presidential nomination, to former Alabama Governor George Wallace: \"I've been around a while and Trump reminds me so much of a lot of the things that George Wallace said and did. I think demagogues are pretty dangerous, really\u00a0... We shouldn't divide people, we shouldn't separate people.\"[126]\nOn January 13, 2017, during an interview with NBC's Chuck Todd for Meet the Press, Lewis stated: \"I don't see the president-elect as a legitimate president.\"[127] He added, \"I think the Russians participated in having this man get elected, and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. I don't plan to attend the inauguration. I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians, and others, that helped him get elected. That's not right. That's not fair. That's not the open, democratic process.\"[128] Trump replied on Twitter the following day, suggesting that Lewis should \"spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to [...] mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results\", and accusing Lewis of being \"All talk, talk, talk\u00a0\u2013 no action or results. Sad!\"[129] Trump's statement about Lewis's district was rated as \"Mostly False\" by PolitiFact,[130] and he was criticized for attacking a civil rights leader such as Lewis, especially one who was brutally beaten for the cause, and especially on Martin Luther King weekend.[131][132][133] Senator John McCain acknowledged Lewis as \"an American hero\" but criticized him, saying: \"this is not the first time that Congressman Lewis has taken a very extreme stand and condemned without any shred of evidence for doing so an incoming president of the United States. This is a stain on Congressman Lewis's reputation\u00a0\u2013 no one else's.\"[134]\nA few days later, Lewis said that he would not attend Trump's inauguration because he did not believe that Trump was the true elected president. \"It will be the first (inauguration) that I miss since I've been in Congress. You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right\", he said. Lewis had failed to attend George W. Bush's inauguration in 2001 because he believed that he too was not a legitimately elected president. Lewis's statement was rated as \"Pants on Fire\" by PolitiFact.[135][136][137]\n\n2020 presidential election[edit]\nLewis endorsed Joe Biden for president on April 7, 2020, a day before Biden effectively secured the Democratic nomination. He recommended Biden pick a woman of color as his running mate.[138]\n\nCommittee assignments[edit]\nPresident Barack Obama hugs Lewis during a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday and the Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches, March 7, 2015.\nLewis served on the following Congressional committees at the time of his death:[139]\n\nCommittee on Ways and Means\nSubcommittee on Oversight (Chair)\nUnited States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation\nCaucus memberships[edit]\nLewis was a member of over 40 caucuses, including:[140]\n\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Caucus (Co-Chair)\nCongressional Structured Settlements Caucus (Co-Chair)\nCongressional Black Caucus\nCongressional Progressive Caucus[141]\nCongressional Brazil Caucus[140]\nCongressional Arts Caucus[142]\nIn 1991, Lewis became the senior chief deputy whip in the Democratic caucus.[143]\n\nBiographies[edit]\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Lewis on Walking With the Wind, July 12, 1998, C-SPAN Q&A interview with Lewis on Across That Bridge, August 5, 2012, C-SPAN In Depth interview with Lewis, October 6, 2013, C-SPAN\nLewis's 1998 autobiography Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement, co-written with Mike D'Orso, won the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award,[144] the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award,[145] the Christopher Award and the Lillian Smith Book Award.[146] It appeared on numerous bestseller lists, was selected as a New York Times Notable Book of the Year,[147] was named by the American Library Association as its Nonfiction Book of the Year,[148] and was included among Newsweek magazine's 2009 list of \"50 Books For Our Times\".[149] It was critically acclaimed, with The Washington Post calling it \"the definitive account of the civil rights movement\"[150] and the Los Angeles Times proclaiming it \"destined to become a classic in civil rights literature\".[151]\nHis life is also the subject of a 2002 book for young people, John Lewis: From Freedom Rider to Congressman. In 2012, Lewis released Across That Bridge, written with Brenda Jones, to mixed reviews. Publishers Weekly's review said, \"At its best, the book provides a testament to the power of nonviolence in social movements\u00a0... At its worst, it resembles an extended campaign speech.\"[152][153]\n\nMarch (2013)[edit]\nLewis signing copies of March Book One (2013), the first volume of his graphic novel autobiography, at Midtown Comics in Manhattan\nExternal videos Presentation by Lewis and Andrew Aydin on March: Book Two, November 21, 2015, C-SPAN Interview with Lewis and Aydin on March: Book Three, September 24, 2016, C-SPAN\nIn 2013, Lewis became the first member of Congress to write a graphic novel, with the launch of a trilogy titled March. The March trilogy is a black and white comics trilogy about the Civil Rights Movement, told through the perspective of civil rights leader and U.S. Congressman John Lewis. The first volume, March: Book One is written by Lewis and Andrew Aydin, illustrated and lettered by Nate Powell and was published in August 2013,[154] the second volume, March: Book Two was published in January 2015 and the final volume, March: Book Three was published in August 2016.[155]\nIn an August 2014 interview, Lewis cited the influence of a 1958 comic book, Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story, on his decision to adapt his experience to the graphic novel format.[156] March: Book One became a number one New York Times bestseller for graphic novels[157] and spent more than a year on the lists.\nMarch: Book One received an \"Author Honor\" from the American Library Association's 2014 Coretta Scott King Book Awards, which honors an African American author of a children's book.[158] Book One also became the first graphic novel to win a Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, receiving a \"Special Recognition\" bust in 2014.[159]\nMarch: Book One was selected by first-year reading programs in 2014 at Michigan State University,[160] Georgia State University,[161] and Marquette University.[162]\nMarch: Book Two was released in 2015 and immediately became both a New York Times and Washington Post bestseller for graphic novels.\nThe release of March: Book Three in August 2016 brought all three volumes into the top 3 slots of the New York Times bestseller list for graphic novels for 6 consecutive weeks.[163] The third volume was announced as the recipient of the 2017 Printz Award for excellence in young-adult literature, the Coretta Scott King Award, the YALSA Award for Excellence in Nonfiction, the 2016 National Book Award in Young People's Literature,[164] and the Sibert Medal at the American Library Association's annual Midwinter Meeting in January 2017.[165]\nThe March trilogy received the Carter G. Woodson Book Award in the Secondary (grades 7\u201312) category in 2017.[166]\n\nRun (2018)[edit]\nIn 2018, Lewis and Andrew Aydin co-wrote another graphic novel as a sequel to the March series entitled Run, which documents Lewis's life after the passage of the Civil Rights Act. The authors teamed with illustrator Afua Richardson for the book, which was originally scheduled to be released in August 2018, but was later rescheduled.[167] It was released on August 3, 2021, a year after his death, as it was one of his last endeavours before he died.[168] Nate Powell, who illustrated March, also contributed to the art.[169]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMarriage and family[edit]\nLewis met his future wife Lillian Miles at a New Year's Eve party hosted by Xernona Clayton. Lillian worked for the library of Atlanta University at the time.  The two of them married one year later in 1964.[170] In 1966, they had a son, who also works in politics. Lillian died on December 31, 2012, the 45th anniversary of the couple's meeting. He has a grandson who lives in Paris.[171]\n\nIllness and death[edit]\nOn December 29, 2019, Lewis announced that he had been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer.[172][173] He remained in the Washington D.C. area for his treatment. Lewis stated: \"I have been in some kind of fight\u00a0\u2013 for freedom, equality, basic human rights\u00a0\u2013 for nearly my entire life. I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now.\"[174][175]\n\nExternal videos Memorial service for Lewis, at Troy University, Troy, Alabama, July 25, 2020, C-SPAN Edmund Pettus Bridge processional in honor of Lewis, July 26, 2020, C-SPAN Memorial service for Lewis at the U.S. Capitol, July 27, 2020, C-SPAN Funeral service for Lewis at Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia, July 30, 2020, C-SPAN\nOn July 17, 2020, Lewis died in Atlanta at the age of 80, [176][177][178] on the same day in the same city as his friend and fellow civil rights activist C.T. Vivian.[179] Lewis had been the final surviving \"Big Six\" civil rights icon.\nThen-president Donald Trump ordered all flags to be flown at half-staff in response to Lewis's death.[180] Condolences also came from the international community, with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven, French President Emmanuel Macron, Irish President Michael D. Higgins among others, all memorializing Lewis.[181][182]\n\nFuneral services[edit]\nPublic ceremonies honoring Lewis began in his hometown of Troy, Alabama at Troy University, which had denied him admission in 1957 due to racial segregation. His casket was then taken for a memorial held at the historic Brown Chapel AME Church in Selma, Alabama.[183] Calls to rename the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, in Lewis's honor grew after his death.[184][185] On July 26, 2020, his casket, carried in a horse-drawn caisson, traveled the same route over the bridge that he walked during the Bloody Sunday march from Selma to Montgomery,[186] before his lying in state at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery.[187]\nUnited States House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that Lewis would lie in state in the United States Capitol Rotunda on July 27 and 28, with a public viewing and procession through Washington, D.C.[188] He is the first African-American lawmaker to be so honored in the Rotunda; in October 2019 his colleague, representative Elijah Cummings, lay in state in the Capitol Statuary Hall.[189] Health concerns related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic led to a decision to have his casket displayed outdoors on the East Front steps during the public viewing hours, rather than the usual line of people in the Rotunda filing past the casket to pay their respects.[190][191][192] On July 29, 2020, Lewis's casket left the U.S. Capitol and was transported back to Atlanta, Georgia, where he lay in state at the Georgia State Capitol.[193]\nAmong the distinguished speakers at his final funeral service at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church were former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, who gave the eulogy. Former President Jimmy Carter, unable to travel during the COVID-19 pandemic due to his advanced age, sent a statement to be read during the service. The then-current President Donald Trump did not attend the service.[194] Lewis was buried at Atlanta's historic South-View Cemetery.[195]\nLewis penned an op-ed to the nation that was published in The New York Times on the day of his funeral.[196] In it, he called on the younger generation to continue the work for justice and an end to hate.[197]\n\nHonors[edit]\nPresidential Medal of Freedom awarded by President Barack Obama in 2011\nLewis was honored by having the 1997 sculpture by Thornton Dial, The Bridge, placed at Ponce de Leon Avenue and Freedom Park, Atlanta, dedicated to him by the artist. In 1999, Lewis was awarded the Wallenberg Medal from the University of Michigan in recognition of his courageous lifelong commitment to the defense of civil and human rights. In that same year, he received the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Speech.[198]\nIn 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded Lewis the Profile in Courage Award \"for his extraordinary courage, leadership and commitment to civil rights\".[199] It is a lifetime achievement award and has been given out only twice, John Lewis and William Winter (in 2008). The next year he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.[200]\n\nJohn Lewis addressing audience in the Great Hall of the Library of Congress on the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, August 28, 2013 In 2004, Lewis received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member James Earl Jones.[201][202]\nIn 2006, he received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards for Public Service.[203] In September 2007, Lewis was awarded the Dole Leadership Prize from the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas.[204]\nLewis was the only living speaker from the March on Washington present on the stage during the inauguration of Barack Obama. Obama signed a commemorative photograph for Lewis with the words, \"Because of you, John. Barack Obama.\"[120]\nIn 2010, Lewis was awarded the First LBJ Liberty and Justice for All Award, given to him by the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation,[205] and the next year, Lewis was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.[206]\n\nJohn Lewis with Frederick D. Reese and Terri Sewell at a 2016 Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony honoring the Selma to Montgomery marches.\nIn 2016, it was announced that a future United States Navy underway replenishment oiler would be named USNS\u00a0John Lewis.[207] Also in 2016, Lewis and fellow Selma marcher Frederick Reese accepted Congressional Gold Medals which were bestowed to the \"foot soldiers\" of the Selma marchers.[208][209] The same year, Lewis was awarded the Liberty Medal at the National Constitution Center. The prestigious award has been awarded to international leaders from Malala Yousafzai to the 14th Dalai Lama, presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton and other dignitaries and visionaries. The timing of Lewis's award coincided with the 150th anniversary of the 14th amendment.[210][211][212] In 2020, Lewis was awarded the Walter P. Reuther Humanitarian Award by Wayne State University, the UAW, and the Reuther family.[213]\nLewis gave numerous commencement addresses, including at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in 2014,[214] Bates College (in Lewiston, Maine) and Washington University in St. Louis in 2016,[215][216][217] Bard College and Bank Street College of Education in 2017, and Harvard University in 2018.[218]\nLewis was recognized for his involvement with comics with the 2017 Inkpot Award.[219]\nOn July 30, 2018, the Atlanta City Council voted to rename Atlanta's Freedom Parkway John Lewis Freedom Parkway.[220] On November 5, 2020, the Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County voted to rename an extensive part of Nashville, Tennessee's 5th Avenue John Lewis Way.[221][222][223]\nOn June 23, 2020, the Fairfax County Public School Board voted to change the name of Robert E. Lee High School to John R. Lewis High School which is located in Springfield, Virginia. A program called John Lewis Now was created in his vision to provide students with in-school curriculum and out-of-school experiences in leadership and government utilizing the nearby Washington D.C. area. [224]\nLewis's death in July 2020 has given rise to support for renaming the historically significant Pettus bridge in Lewis's honor, an idea previously floated years ago.[225][226] After his death, the Board of Fairfax County Public Schools announced that Robert E. Lee High School in Springfield, Virginia would be renamed John R. Lewis High School.[227][228]\nFollowing his death, Troy University announced that the main building on its flagship campus would bear the name of John Lewis. The building, which was the oldest on campus, was previously named after Bibb Graves, a former governor of Alabama and high-ranking officer of the Ku Klux Klan.[229]\nOn August 1, 2020, a statue of Lewis was revealed by sculptor Gregory Johnson. The statue was commissioned by Rodney Mims Cook Jr. and was installed at Cook Park in Atlanta, Georgia, in April 2021.[230][231]\n\nStatue of Lewis in Cook Park in Atlanta, unveiled in 2020.\nOn February 21, 2021, President Joe Biden marked Lewis's late birthday on Twitter, urging all Americans to \u201ccarry on his mission in the fight for justice and equality for all.\u201d He tweeted, \u201cWhile my dear friend may no longer be with us, his life and legacy provide an eternal moral compass on which direction to march. May we carry on his mission in the fight for justice and equality for all.\u201d[232]\nOn October 27, 2021, the University of California, Santa Cruz named one of its residential colleges, formerly known as College Ten, John R Lewis College.\n[233]\n\nHonorary academic degrees[edit]\nLewis receives an honorary degree from Brown University in 2012\nLewis was awarded more than 50 honorary degrees,[234] including:\n\n1989: Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Troy State University (now Troy University)[235]\n1995: Honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from Northeastern University[236]\n1998: Honorary Humane Letters degree from Brandeis University[237]\n1999: Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Massachusetts Boston[238]\n1999: Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Knox College[239]\n2001: Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from University at Albany[240]\n2002: Honorary D.H.L. from Howard University[241]\n2003: Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the College of Wooster[242]\n2004: Honorary degree from Portland State University[243]\n2004: Honorary LHD from Juniata College[244]\n2007: Honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Vermont[245]\n2007: Honorary LL.D. degree from Adelphi University[246]\n2012: Honorary LL.D. degrees from Brown University,[247] University of Pennsylvania,[248] Harvard University,[218] and the University of Connecticut School of Law[249]\n2013: Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters[250] from Judson College\n2013: Honorary LL.D. degrees from Cleveland State University[251] and Union College[252]\n2014: Honorary LL.D. degree from Emory University[253]\n2014: Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the School of Visual Arts.[254]\n2014: Honorary Bachelor of Arts from Lawrence University.[255]\n2014: Honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Marquette University[256]\n2015: Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University.[257]\n2015: Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Lawrence University[258]\n2015: Honorary degree from Goucher College[259]\n2015: Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Hampton University[260]\n2016: Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from New York University[261]\n2016: Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Bates College[217]\n2016: Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Washington University in St. Louis[262]\n2016: Honorary Doctor of Policy Analysis from the Frederick S.

Kennedy especially in regards to his support for civil rights throughout his time as a senator for New York and during Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign.[293] Lewis also recounted his deep sorrow following the 1968 assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.[294]\nLewis appeared alongside Amandla Stenberg to present Green Book as Best Picture at the 91st Academy Awards that took place on February 24, 2019.\nLewis attended comics conventions to promote his graphic novel, most notably the San Diego Comic-Con, which he attended in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. During the 2015 convention, Lewis led, along with his graphic novel collaborators Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell, an impromptu simulated Selma civil rights march arm in arm with children, during which he wore the same clothes as he did on Bloody Sunday, garnering thousands of con goers to participate. The event became so popular it was repeated in 2016 and 2017.[295][296]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nReporting Civil Rights: American Journalism 1963\u20131973 (Library of America: 2003) ISBN\u00a01-931082-29-4\nWalking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement by John Lewis with Michael D'Orso, (Harvest Books: 1999) ISBN\u00a00-15-600708-8.
