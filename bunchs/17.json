He has written five books about the media. Kurtz left CNN and joined Fox News in 2013.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nKurtz was born to a Jewish family[2] in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, the son of Marcia, a homemaker, and Leonard Kurtz, a clothing executive.[3] He is a 1970 graduate of Sheepshead Bay High School[4]\nand the University at Buffalo (State University of New York). In college he worked on a student newspaper, the Spectrum, becoming the editor his senior year.[3] Kurtz earned a B. A. (psychology and English) in 1974. He then attended the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\n\nCareer[edit]\nAfter college, Kurtz went to work for the Record in New Jersey.[3] He moved to Washington D.C. to work as a reporter for syndicated columnist Jack Anderson.[3] Kurtz left Anderson to join The Washington Star, an afternoon paper. When the newspaper closed in 1981, Kurtz was hired at The Washington Post by Bob Woodward, then the Metro editor. Kurtz has also written for The New Republic, The Washington Monthly, and New York magazine.\n\nThe Washington Post[edit]\nKurtz joined the staff of The Washington Post in 1981 and left in 2010 (29 years). He served there as a national affairs correspondent, New York bureau chief and deputy national editor.[5] Kurtz covered the news media between 1990 and 2010 for The Washington Post.[6][7]\n\nReliable Sources on CNN[edit]\nFrom 1998 until 2013, Kurtz served as host of the weekly CNN program Reliable Sources, a cable television program that explores the standards, performance and biases of the media.[8] Kurtz led the scrutinizing of the media's fairness and objectivity by questioning journalists of top news organizations, including those at CNN.[9] The show premiered in 1992 when it originated as a one-hour special to discuss the media's coverage of the Persian Gulf War.[10]\n\nThe Daily Beast[edit]\nIn October 2010, Kurtz announced he was moving to the online publication The Daily Beast.[11] He served as the Washington bureau chief for the website, writing on media and politics until 2013.[12][13] His salary at The Daily Beast was reported to be $600,000 a year.[14] On May 2, 2013, the site's editor-in-chief Tina Brown announced that Kurtz and The Daily Beast had \"parted company\".[15] It occurred in the aftermath of a controversy in which Kurtz incorrectly accused NBA player Jason Collins of failing to acknowledge a former heterosexual engagement when he came out as a homosexual, but Kurtz stated the parting was mutual and \"in the works for some time\".[16][17][18] Sources inside the Daily Beast newsroom have stated that Kurtz's departure became inevitable once he began writing for and promoting a lesser-known media website called Daily Download.[19][20] Kurtz was previously the subject of controversy when Nancy Pelosi denied making a statement Kurtz attributed to her,[21] and a quote Kurtz attributed to Darrell Issa was reported to have actually been made by his spokesperson.[22]  Brown later said on Twitter she fired Kurtz for \"serial inaccuracy\".[23]\n\nFox News[edit]\nOn June 20, 2013, Kurtz left CNN to join Fox News Channel to host a weekend media program and write a column for FoxNews.com.[24] Kurtz's Media Buzz replaced the Fox News Watch program hosted by Jon Scott.\n\nBooks[edit]\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Kurtz on Media Circus, June 20, 1993, C-SPAN Washington Journal interview with Kurtz on Spin Cycle, March 16, 1998, C-SPAN Presentation by Kurtz on The Fortune Tellers, September 6, 2000, C-SPAN After Words interview with Kurtz on Reality Show, December 22, 2007, C-SPAN Washington Journal interview with Kurtz on Media Madness, February 20, 2018, C-SPAN\nMedia Circus: The Trouble with America's Newspapers (1993, ISBN\u00a00-8129-2022-8) identifies problems afflicting U.S. newspapers and offers suggestions. Among the issues identified are timid leadership, a spreading tabloid approach to news with a growing focus on celebrities and personal scandal, poor coverage of racial issues and the Persian Gulf war, increasing bureaucracy and a pasteurization of the news.[25][26]\nHot Air: All Talk, All the Time (1997, ISBN\u00a00-8129-2624-2) describes failings of the talk-show and political talk-show format even as it had been rapidly proliferating on television and radio. Some problems he identifies include superficiality, lies, hysteria, lack of preparation, sensationalism and conflicts of interest.[27]\nSpin Cycle: Inside the Clinton Propaganda Machine (1998, ISBN\u00a00-684-85231-4) describes various techniques used by the Clinton White House to put spin on the controversies and scandals surrounding the Clintons and to refocus the attention of the media on topics other than non-issues focused on by the media.[28][29]\nThe Fortune Tellers: Inside Wall Street's Game of Money, Media, and Manipulation (2000, ISBN\u00a00-684-86879-2) addresses the growing public fascination with stock market trading as fueled by cable television shows and internet sites providing platforms to pundits, stock touts and brokerage firm stock analysts. The potential for manipulation of the media and the public by stock market insiders is discussed.[30][31]\nReality Show: Inside the Last Great Television News War (2007, ISBN\u00a00-7432-9982-5) chronicles the struggles at TV networks ABC, NBC and CBS to enhance the stature, credibility and audience draw of their anchors of the evening network news programs. The book's focus is on ABC's Charles Gibson, CBS's Katie Couric and NBC's Brian Williams.[32][33]\nMedia Madness: Donald Trump, The Press, And The War Over The Truth, which was released in January 2018, discussed Donald Trump's fights with the news media during the first year of his presidency.[34][35][36] The book argues that the media unfairly treated President Trump. According to a review by Jonathan Chait in New York magazine, \"To Kurtz ... the 'massive imbalance' between Trump's coverage and coverage of other presidents can only be explained by media bias. He treats this premise as definitionally true\u2014not defending it outright, but simply building his case as though no other explanation could even theoretically exist. And so the strange mission of his book is to analyze the hostile relationship between Trump and the mainstream news media without in any way acknowledging any background as to why.\"[37]\n\nCriticism[edit]\nThis article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section may compromise the article's neutrality. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. (January 2018)\nKurtz has publicly declined to state his political affiliation.[38] As a high-profile media critic and analyst, Kurtz's political leanings and multiple employers and possible biases have been discussed by fellow media critics and pundits. Both liberal and conservative viewpoints have been observed in his writing.[3] Journalist Mickey Kaus, reporting on and partially quoting from a letter by journalist Charles Kaiser in The New Republic, wrote that Kurtz \"has large, non-technical conflicts of interest, since he free-lances and takes money 'from the people he writes about, from Time Warner to Cond\u00e9 Nast.'... One seemingly conflicting interest is Kurtz co-hosting CNN's Reliable Sources, in which he obtains monetary supplements as well as national renown.\"[39]\nKurtz has received criticism for his apparent support of syndicated radio host Don Imus. Former Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly has called out Kurtz for criticizing Fox News. The network covered a story about the United States Justice Department regarding its prosecution of members of the New Black Panther Party for accusations of voter intimidation during the 2008 United States Presidential Election. O'Reilly criticized network news media outlets, particularly Bob Schieffer of the CBS News talk show Face the Nation, for not asking Attorney General Eric Holder about the story. When Kurtz discussed the topic on Reliable Sources, he mentioned that Fox News was \"pushing\" the story. O'Reilly criticized Kurtz's description that Fox pushed the story and said that Kurtz's newspaper, The Washington Post, had its own ombudsman Andrew Alexander say that it regretted not pursuing the story earlier due to newsworthiness.[40]\n\n\nKURTZ: I think the argument that I've heard Olbermann make in the past about Fox News \u2013 it's not an argument that I embrace \u2013 is that, because it poses as a news organization and puts out dangerous misinformation is a cheerleader for the Bush administration, that it's misinforming our society. But you know what? They're entitled to do that.[41]\n\n\nKurtz's 2008 Reliable Sources interview of Kimberly Dozier, a CBS reporter wounded in Iraq, was criticized by several members of the media because Kurtz's wife had been paid as a publicist for Dozier's memoir. During the interview, Kurtz praised Dozier and read passages of her book.[42]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nKurtz married Sheri Annis in May 2003. Annis, a media consultant and political commentator, served as campaign spokesperson for Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and has worked on various conservative political initiatives, including California's Proposition 227 and Proposition 209.[43]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"UBT: Alumni Profiles\". buffalo.edu.

Prior to joining Politico, he worked for Reuters and also edited and wrote the column \"Press Box\" for Slate, an online magazine. Before his stay at Slate, Shafer edited two city weeklies, Washington City Paper and SF Weekly. Much of Shafer's writing focuses on what he sees as a lack of precision and rigor in reporting by the mainstream media, which he says \"thinks its duty is to keep you cowering in fright.\"[1] One frequent topic is media coverage of the War on Drugs. \n\n\nCareer[edit]\nLibertarianism[edit]\nShafer has written supportively of libertarianism. He wrote, \"Traditionally, the state censors and marginalizes voices while private businesses tend to remain tolerant.\"[2] In 2000, he explained his political views as follows: \"I agree with the Libertarian Party platform: much smaller government, much lower taxes, an end to income redistribution, repeal of the drug laws, fewer gun laws, a dismantled welfare state, an end to corporate subsidies, First Amendment absolutism, a scaled-back warfare state. (You get the idea.)\"[3]\nConsistent with this perspective, on 20 April 2020 Shafer expressed opposition to the Local Journalism Sustainability Act, saying, \"You wouldn't put a dead man on a ventilator, would you?\"[4]\n\nInvestigation of Gerald Posner[edit]\nIn February 2010, Shafer reported that the chief investigative reporter for The Daily Beast, Gerald Posner, had plagiarized five sentences from an article published by The Miami Herald. Shafer also discovered that Posner had plagiarized content from a Miami Herald blog, a Miami Herald editorial, Texas Lawyer and a health care journalism blog.[5][6] Posner was dismissed from The Daily Beast following an internal review.[7]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Shafer, Jack (December 14, 2010). \"Stupid drug story of the week\".

He was Chairman and CEO of General Electric (GE) between 1981 and 2001.\nWhen Welch retired from GE, he received a severance payment of $417 million, the largest such payment in business history up to that point.[1]\nIn 2006, Welch's net worth was estimated at $720 million.[2]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nJack Welch was born in Peabody, Massachusetts, the only child of Grace (Andrews), a homemaker, and John Francis Welch Sr., a Boston & Maine Railroad conductor.[3] Welch was Irish American and Catholic. His paternal and maternal grandparents were Irish.[4]\nThroughout his early life in middle school and high school, Welch found work in the summers as a golf caddie, newspaper delivery boy, shoe salesman, and drill press operator.[4] Welch attended Salem High School, where he participated in baseball, football, and captained the hockey team and became second lieutenant right after graduating.[4]\nLate in his senior year, Welch was accepted to University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he studied chemical engineering. Welch worked in chemical engineering at Sunoco and PPG Industries during his college summers.[4] In his sophomore year, he became a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity.[4] Welch graduated in 1957 with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering, turning down offers from several companies in order to attend graduate school at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[4][5] He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1960 with a master's and a PhD in chemical engineering.[6][7]\n\nGeneral Electric[edit]\nWelch joined General Electric in 1960. He worked as a junior chemical engineer in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, at a salary of $10,500, which would be equivalent to approximately $106,000 in 2022 dollars. In 1961, Welch planned to quit his job as junior engineer because he was dissatisfied with the raise offered to him and was unhappy with the bureaucracy he observed at GE. Welch was persuaded to remain at GE by Reuben Gutoff, an executive at the company, who promised him that he would help create the small-company atmosphere Welch desired.[8] In 1963, under Welch\u2019s management of the facility, an explosion at a factory blew off the roof, and he was almost fired for that episode.[9]\nBy 1968, Welch became the vice president and head of GE's plastics division, which at the time was a $26 million operation for GE.[5] Welch oversaw production as well as the marketing for the GE-developed plastics Lexan and Noryl. Not long after, in 1971, Welch also became the vice president of GE's metallurgical and chemical divisions.[5] By 1973, Welch was named group executive, managing chemical, metallurgical, medical systems, appliance components and electronic components businesses. He held that position until 1979, which involved him working with the corporate headquarters, exposing him to many of the \"big fish\" he would one day be among.[10] In 1977 Welch was named senior vice president and head of Consumer Products and Services Division, a position he held until 1979 when he became the vice chairman of GE.[5]\nIn 1981, Welch became GE's youngest chairman and CEO, succeeding Reginald H. Jones. By 1982, Welch had dismantled much of the earlier management put together by Jones with aggressive simplification and consolidation. One of his primary leadership directives was that GE had to be No. 1 or No. 2 in the industries it participated in.[11]\n\nCEO[edit]\nThrough the 1980s, Welch sought to streamline GE. In 1981, he made a speech in New York City called \"Growing fast in a slow-growth economy\".[12] Under Welch's leadership, GE increased market value from $12 billion in 1981 to $410 billion when he retired,[13] making 600 acquisitions while shifting into emerging markets. Welch pioneered a policy of informality at the work place, allowing all employees to have a small-business experience at a large corporation.[8] Welch worked to eradicate perceived inefficiency by trimming inventories and dismantling the bureaucracy that had almost led him to leave GE in the past. He closed factories, reduced payrolls and cut lackluster units.[14]\nWelch valued surprise and made unexpected visits to GE's plants and offices.[8] Welch popularized so-called \"rank and yank\" policies used now by other corporate entities. Each year, Welch would fire the bottom 10% of his managers, regardless of absolute performance.[15] He earned a reputation for brutal candor. He rewarded those in the top 20% with bonuses and employee stock options. He also broadened the stock options program at GE, extending availability from top executives to nearly one third of all employees. Welch is also known for abolishing the nine-layer management hierarchy and bringing a sense of informality to the company.[16]\nDuring the early 1980s he was dubbed \"Neutron Jack\" (in reference to the neutron bomb) for eliminating employees while leaving buildings intact.[17] In Jack: Straight from the Gut, Welch stated GE had 411,000 employees at the end of 1980, and 299,000 at the end of 1985. Of the 112,000 who left the payroll, 37,000 were in businesses which GE sold off, and 81,000 were reduced in continuing businesses. In return, GE had tremendously increased its market capitalization. Welch reduced basic research, and closed or sold off under-performing businesses.\nIn 1986, GE acquired RCA.[18] RCA's corporate headquarters were located in Rockefeller Center; Welch subsequently took up an office in the then\u2013GE Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza (now called the Comcast Building). The RCA acquisition resulted in GE selling off RCA properties to other companies and keeping NBC as part of the GE portfolio of businesses. During the 1990s, Welch shifted GE's business from manufacturing to financial services through numerous acquisitions.\nWelch adopted Motorola's Six Sigma quality program in late 1995. In 1980, the year before Welch became CEO, GE recorded revenues of roughly $26.8 billion and in 2000, the year before he left, they were nearly $130 billion.[13] By 1999 he was named \"Manager of the Century\" by Fortune magazine.[19]\nWelch was passionate in making people GE's core competency.[20] There was a lengthy and publicized succession planning saga prior to his retirement among James McNerney, Robert Nardelli, and Jeff Immelt, with Immelt eventually selected to succeed Welch as chairman and CEO. His successor plan had always been a priority, as noted in his 1991 speech \"From now on, [choosing my successor] is the most important decision I'll make. It occupies a considerable amount of thought almost every day.\"[21]\nWelch's \"walk-away\" package from GE was not valued at the time of his retirement, but GMI Ratings estimates its worth at $420 million.[22]\nHe served as Chairman of The Business Council in 1991 and 1992.[23]\n\nCriticism[edit]\nUpon his retirement from GE, Welch had stated that his effectiveness as its CEO for two decades would be measured by the company's performance for a comparable period under his successors. Welch had grown GE to over $450 billion in market capitalization, of which about 40% was in financial services.\nTwenty years later, the company's market capitalization was only $200 billion, and Welch refused to discuss its decline, other than noting much of the decline had resulted from investments in real estate, and that his immediate, handpicked successor Jeff Immelt had to deal with the after effects of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack.[24] The New York Times published a critical article in 2017, noting GE's stock price as overvalued under Welch because of the growth of the financial services sector, as well as describing the amalgamated corporation's decline in 16 years under Immelt, who likewise was one of the country's highest-paid managers and eventually sold off two of Welch's largest acquisitions, NBCUniversal and GE Capital.[25]\nUnder Welch's leadership, GE waged a twenty-year battle with the Environmental Protection Agency and New York State over polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that the company dumped into the Hudson River at its capacitor products division plant in Hudson Falls, New York.\nWelch disputed scientists who classified PCBs as forever chemicals that can cause negative health consequences.[26] The chemicals contaminated the aquifer beneath the plant to the point that the water was unusable for human consumption without treatment. New York State's Department of Environmental Consumption also advised people against eating fish from the river near the site.[27] He went on to call the Obama administration's prioritization of addressing climate change \"radical behavior\".[28]\nAccording to BusinessWeek in 1998, Welch's critics questioned whether the short-term performance pressure he placed on employees may have led them to \"cut corners\", thus contributing to subsequent scandals over defense-contracting, and/or the Kidder, Peabody & Co. bond-trading scheme in the early 1990s.[8]\nThe following year, CEO Welch took issue with reclassification of GE in the Fortune 500 as a \"diversified financial services company\" rather than an \"electrical equipment company\", and by 2005 many had noted that the price-earnings ratios of the financial services sector were lower than that for GE.[29] In 2014, GE Capital (the company's major financial services branch organized during Welch's tenure) agreed to the largest credit card discrimination settlement in history, concerning many years of deceptive marketing as well as discriminatory credit practices.[30] After Welch's tenure, GE Capital had been labeled as \"too big to fail\" and had become regulated by the Federal Reserve. The retired Welch publicly praised his former firm's \"slim-down\" and return to being an industrial company.[29] In 2018, Welch discussed the different financial culture in Kidder, Peabody & Co., whose acquisition he arranged during his tenure at GE, and whose ethos was based on short-term bonus calculations.[24] Shortly before the settlement was announced, GE Capital renamed itself as Synchrony Bank; the spin-off took two years.\nWelch also often received criticism for a lack of compassion for the middle class and working class. When asked about excessive CEO pay compared to ordinary workers (including backdating stock options, golden parachutes for nonperformance, and extravagant retirement packages), Welch labeled such allegations \"outrageous\" and vehemently opposed proposed SEC regulations affecting executive compensation. Countering the public uproar, Welch declared that CEO compensation should continue to be dictated by the \"free market\", without interference from government or other outside parties.[31]\nWelch's income and assets came under particular scrutiny during his divorce from his second wife, Jane Welch, in 2001, for adultery with the woman who became his third wife. Court filings during the divorce described Welch's GE compensation, which led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the then-retired Welch's employment contracts with GE.[32][33]\nIn 1996, Welch and GE had agreed to a \"retention package\" worth $2.5 million, and which promised continued access after Welch's retirement to benefits he had received as CEO\u2014including an apartment in New York, baseball tickets and the use of a private jet and chauffeured car.[32][34] Welch stated that he did not want more money, nor a more traditional stock package, but instead preferred to retain the lifestyle he had enjoyed as GE's CEO. According to a 2008 interview with Welch, he had filed the agreement with the SEC, and addressed the media attention and accusations of being \"greedy\" by renouncing those benefits.[34]\nIn 2012, Welch and his third wife, Suzy Welch, quit their business associations with Fortune magazine and Reuters news service after Fortune published an article which criticized Welch's tweet, shortly before the 2012 election, which alleged that the Obama administration manipulated certain economic statistics, as well as another article which elucidated the 100,000 jobs GE lost during his tenure as CEO.[35]\n\nLater career[edit]\nFollowing Welch's retirement from General Electric, he took on advisory roles with private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and with the chief executive of IAC, Barry Diller.[36][37] In addition to his consulting and advisory roles, Welch had been active on the public speaking circuit and co-wrote a popular column for BusinessWeek with his wife, Suzy, for four years until November 2009. The column was syndicated by The New York Times.[37][38]\nIn September 2004, the Central Intelligence Agency published a parody of Welch applying his management skills while serving as imagined Deputy Director of Intelligence.[39]\nIn 2005, he published Winning, a book about management co-written with Suzy Welch, which reached No. 1 on The Wall Street Journal bestseller list[40] and appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list.[36][37]\nOn January 25, 2006, Welch gave his name to Sacred Heart University's College of Business, which was known as the \"John F. Welch College of Business\"[41] until 2016, when it began using the name the \"Jack Welch College of Business\". Since September 2006, Welch had been teaching a class at the MIT Sloan School of Management to a hand-picked group of 30 MBA students with a demonstrated career interest in leadership.[42]\nIn December 2016, Welch joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.[43]\n\nJack Welch Management Institute[edit]\nIn 2009, Welch founded the Jack Welch Management Institute (JWMI), a program at Chancellor University that offered an online executive Master of Business Administration. The institute was acquired by Strayer University in 2011.[44] Welch had been very actively involved with the curriculum, faculty and students since the beginning of the institution.[45][46] JWMI's MBA program was recently[when?] named the number one most influential education brand on LinkedIn[47] and one of the top business schools to watch in 2016.[48] The program has also been named one of the Top 25 Online MBA Programs four years in a row (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020) by The Princeton Review.[49] Its goal is not to make money, but to build over time focusing on the quality of the program and increasing the number of students enrolled year after year.[50]\nAt GE, Welch became known for his teaching and growing leaders. He had taught at MIT Sloan School of Management and taught seminars to CEOs all over the globe. \"More than 35 CEOs at today's top companies [were] trained under Jack Welch\".[51] JWMI students had direct access to Welch and he hosted quarterly video conferences with his students.[51]\nIt is known that along with his video conferences, Welch created many video responses to messages on bulletin boards and answered individual emails. His investment in the university was also reflected in his interest in the institute's Net Promoter score (NPS). He administered surveys on satisfaction regularly and scrutinized the results to find scores that needed improvement. In an interview with Wired Academic, Welch explained the overall status of his MBA program, stating that the persistence rate of students continuing on to a second year had grown from 90% to 95%, and that JWMI turns away very few students in the admissions process. He also said that he would like better leadership training for MBA students.[52]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nWelch had four children with his first wife, Carolyn. They divorced amicably in 1987 after 28 years of marriage.[53] His second wife, Jane Beasley, was a former mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer. She married Welch in April 1989, and they divorced in 2003. While Welch had crafted a prenuptial agreement, Beasley insisted on a ten-year time limit to its applicability, and thus she was able to leave the marriage reportedly with around $180 million.[54]\nWelch's third wife, Suzy Wetlaufer (n\u00e9e Spring), co-authored his 2005 book Winning as Suzy Welch. She served briefly as the editor-in-chief of the Harvard Business Review. Beasley found out about an affair between Wetlaufer and Welch. Beasley informed the Review and Wetlaufer was forced to resign in early 2002 after admitting to the affair with Welch while preparing an interview with him for the magazine.[55] They married on April 24, 2004.[56]\nFrom January 27 to October 9, 2012, the couple wrote a biweekly column for Reuters and Fortune.[57][58] The couple stopped after an article critical of Welch and his GE career was published by Fortune.[59]\n\nDeath[edit]\nWelch died from kidney failure at his home in New York City[60] on March 1, 2020, at age 84.[61][62][63][64]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nWelch identified politically as a Republican.[65] He claimed that global warming is \"the attack on capitalism that socialism couldn't bring\", and that it is a form of \"mass neurosis\".[66] Yet he said that every business must embrace green products and green ways of doing business, \"whether you believe in global warming or not\u00a0... because the world wants these products\".[67]\nRegarding shareholder value, Welch said in a Financial Times interview on the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009, \"On the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world. Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy...your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products.\"[68]\nWelch was widely criticized for his views on the job numbers from September 2012.[69][64]\nAfter the Bureau of Labor Statistics released employment data stating that the U.S. unemployment rate had dropped from 8.1% to 7.8%, Welch tweeted, \"Unbelievable jobs numbers\u00a0... these Chicago guys will do anything\u00a0... can't debate so change numbers\".[70] Welch stood by his tweet, stating if he could write it again, he would add question marks at the end to make it clear that his intention was to raise a question over the legitimacy of the numbers.[71] A subsequent New York Post article on the employment data suggested manipulation of some of the survey responses by an individual employee in 2010,[72] but that article was widely debunked, including the fact that the employee had not worked at the Bureau since 2011.[73][74][75] No proof of the political manipulation of the job numbers from September 2012 has been presented.[76] The Census Bureau later released a statement denying the possibility of systematic manipulation of the data.[77] Still, in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Welch wrote that the debate led to people looking at unemployment data more carefully and skeptically. Referencing his original tweet, he stated \"Thank God I did\", in a Squawk Box appearance,[71] and also wrote, \"The coming election is too important to be decided on a number. Especially when that number seems so wrong\".[78]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nWelch has been described as \"perhaps the most celebrated American boss of recent decades.\"[79]\nIn a 2015 article in Harvard Business Review, business consultant Ron Ashkenas argues that \"Jack Welch's approach to breaking down silos still works,\" citing examples of engineering companies who have discovered for themselves that \"fragmented, geographically dispersed\" patterns of organization make it \"very difficult ... to coordinate efforts across functions, keep everyone focused on the cost and delivery goals, and get people to reach consensus.\"[80]\nWelch has been criticized for practices that have harmed workers and the company: he eliminated thousands of jobs at GE contributing to a reduction of the U.S. manufacturing base. He eliminated 10% of employees every year, a practice adopted by many other companies. He was a leading proponent of mergers and acquisitions, helping to give rise to an economy that is more concentrated and less dynamic. He pioneered \"financialization,\" changing GE from a manufacturing company into, effectively, an unregulated bank, which harmed GE over the long term.[81]\nAs of late 2021, General Electric planned to break into three public companies and effectively cease to exist. The companies would separately operate in the aviation, health care, and energy markets.[82] As of 2021, GE was headed by H. Lawrence Culp Jr. who was named in 2018 as its fourth CEO since Welch's departure.\n\nWider impact[edit]\nIn his 2022 book The Man Who Broke Capitalism, journalist David Gelles argues that Welch's practices, including financialization, downsizing and mergers and acquisitions, have caused widespread damage to GE and many other large corporations and have contributed to the massive increase in income inequality in the United States since the 1980s.[83][84]\n\nPopular culture[edit]\nOn March 11, 2010, Welch cameoed as himself in the NBC sitcom 30 Rock, appearing in the season four episode \"Future Husband\". In the episode, Welch confronts Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy, to confirm the sale of NBCUniversal to a fictional Philadelphia-based cable company called Kabletown. The sale is a satirical reference to the real-world acquisition of NBCUniversal from General Electric by Comcast in November 2009.[85]\n\nWorks Authored by Welch[edit]\nWelch, Jack and John A. Byrne.
