    "wiki": "American internet journalist and talk radio host\n\n\nMatt DrudgeDrudge in 1996BornMatthew Nathan Drudge (1966-10-27) October 27, 1966 (age\u00a057)Takoma Park, Maryland, U.S.Occupation(s)Political commentator, news editorKnown\u00a0forReporting political scandals, creating the Drudge Report\nMatthew Nathan Drudge (born October 27, 1966) is an American journalist and the creator/editor of the Drudge Report, an American news aggregator. Drudge is also an author and a former radio and television show host.[1]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nDrudge was raised in Takoma Park, Maryland, near Washington, D.C.[2] His father, Robert Drudge, a former social worker,[2] and his mother[1] divorced when he was six. Drudge went to live with his mother.[2] He had few friends and was an avid news reader and radio talk show fan.[2][3] Drudge graduated 341st out of a high school class of 355.[4] In his book Drudge Manifesto, Drudge says that he \"failed his Bar Mitzvah\".[2]\n\nCareer[edit]\nDrudge Report[edit]\nMain article: Drudge Report\nDrudge was unknown before he began the news aggregation site, the Drudge Report.[5] For many years, he took odd jobs such as night counterman at a 7-Eleven convenience store, telemarketer for Time-Life books, McDonald's manager, and sales assistant at a New York City grocery store. In 1989, he moved to Los Angeles, where he took up residence in a small Hollywood apartment. He took a job in the gift shop of CBS studios, eventually working his way up to manager. Here, he was apparently privy to some inside gossip, part of the inspiration for founding the Drudge Report. Worried about his son's aimlessness, Drudge's father insisted on buying him a Packard Bell computer in 1994.[1] The Drudge Report began as email notes sent out to a few friends.\nThe original issues were part gossip and part opinion. They were distributed as an email newsletter and posted to alt.showbiz.gossip Usenet forum. In 1996, the newsletter transitioned slowly from entertainment gossip to political gossip and moved from email to the Web as its primary distribution mechanism.\nIn March 1995, the Drudge Report had 1,000 email subscribers; by 1997, Drudge had 85,000 subscribers to his email service. Drudge's website gained in popularity in the late 1990s when he reported a number of stories before the mainstream media. Drudge first received national attention in 1996 when he broke the news that Jack Kemp would be Republican Bob Dole's running mate in the 1996 presidential election. In 1998, he gained popularity when he published the reporting of then-Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff, becoming the first media outlet to publish the news that later became the Monica Lewinsky scandal.[6]\nDrudge met Andrew Breitbart in Los Angeles during the 1990s and became his mentor, with Breitbart later helping to run the Drudge Report.[7][8] Breitbart announced in 2005 that he was \"amicably leaving the Drudge Report after a long and close working relationship with Matt Drudge\", but still helped run Drudge's website from Los Angeles by working the afternoon shift, in addition to running Breitbart.[9][10][11]\nA story by Business 2.0 magazine from April 2003 estimated that Drudge's website received $3,500 a day (almost $1.3 million a year) in advertising revenues. Subtracting his relatively minor server costs, the magazine estimated that the Drudge Report website netted $800,000 a year.[12] An article in The Miami Herald from September 2003 said that Drudge estimated he earns $1.2 million a year from his website and radio show. During an April 30, 2004 appearance on C-SPAN, he confirmed that he earns over $1 million.\nFor many years, Drudge was based out of his one-bedroom apartment in Hollywood. Today, he maintains the website from his two properties in Miami, Florida.[1][7] In updating the site, he reportedly monitors multiple television news channels and a number of websites on several computers in his home office.[13]\n\nFox News television show[edit]\nFrom June 1998 to November 1999, Drudge hosted a Saturday night television show called Drudge on the Fox News Channel. The show ended by mutual agreement. Drudge had refused to go on air, charging Fox News with censorship when the network prevented him from showing photos of surgery on Samuel Armas. Drudge, who opposes abortion, wanted to use a picture of a tiny hand reaching out from the womb to dramatize his argument against late-term abortion, but Fox's John Moody decided that that would be misleading because the photo was not of an abortion but an emergency operation on the fetus for spina bifida.[14] Fox News alleged breach of contract but, after Drudge issued an apology,[15] Fox issued a statement calling the parting \"amicable\".[15]\n\nRadio talk show[edit]\nDrudge hosted a Sunday night talk radio show\u00a0\u2013 \"the only time anyone will let me on the air\", he claimed. The show, which was also named the Drudge Report, was syndicated by Premiere Radio Networks. He guest hosted for the conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Drudge gained notice in the early 2000s by becoming a frequent reference for news material on Limbaugh's, Sean Hannity's, and Mark Levin's radio shows. He was often acknowledged by Michael Savage as a source of topics for The Savage Nation. Lynn Samuels, for a time, served as Drudge's call screener.\nDrudge left his position as radio host with Premiere effective September 30, 2007. He was replaced by Cincinnati radio station WLW's Bill Cunningham on the network and in most markets,[16] though in a few larger markets, John Batchelor replaced him instead.\n\nBooks[edit]\nThe Drudge Revolution: The Inside Story of How Talk Radio, Fox News, and a Gift Shop Clerk with an Internet Connection Took Down the Mainstream Media was published on July 28, 2020. In the book, author and investigative journalist Matthew Lysiak interviews more than 200 former friends and associates, including former Drudge Report editor Joseph Curl, to reveal the first inside look at Drudge and his website.\nDrudge wrote a book with Julia Phillips in 2000 titled Drudge Manifesto, which reached the New York Times Best Seller list.[17][18] The book features a transcript of a Q&A session conducted at the National Press Club on June 2, 1998, which lays out Drudge's raison d'\u00eatre. It also contains copies of emails sent to Drudge by his readers, transcripts of Drudge talking to his cat, and extensive descriptions of parties Drudge has attended and how the celebrities there reacted to him. A review in The Washington Post said: \"Indeed, while Drudge Manifesto runs 247 pages ...  Which leaves, in the end, 112 pages of new material, including nine pages of poetry.\"[19][20]  A review from the Columbia Journalism Review stated: \"By any standard, Drudge's book is padded\", and: \"It is a weird, stream-of-conscious mixture of telling readers how he got his stories and mocking his critics.\"\n\nInfluence[edit]\nIn the 2020 book Drudge Revolution, author Matthew Lysiak describes how every major presidential campaign dating back to the late 90s had a staffer whose responsibility was to make a connection and potentially influence Drudge.[citation needed] Ahead of the 2008 Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton communication director Tracy Sefl befriended Drudge, a relationship which she describes in the book as \"scary\" due to the power of the Drudge Report.[citation needed]\nIn their 2006 book The Way to Win, Mark Halperin and John Harris report that Republican National Convention chairman Ken Mehlman \"kind of brags\" (as then-CNN host Howard Kurtz put it) about utilizing the Drudge channel.[21] They also wrote that \"Drudge, with his droll Dickensian name, was not the only media or political agent whose actions led to John Kerry's defeat. But his role placed him at the center of the game.\"[22]\nIn 2006, Time named Drudge one of the 100 most influential people in the world,[23] describing the Drudge Report as \"a ludicrous combination of gossip, political intrigue and extreme weather reports ... still put together mostly by the guy who started out as a convenience-store clerk.\"\nABC News concluded that the Drudge Report sets the tone for national political coverage.[24] The article says \"Republican operatives keep an open line to Drudge, often using him to attack their opponents.\"\nIn October 2006, Washington Post editor Len Downie, speaking at the Online News Association's annual convention in Washington, D.C., said, \"Our largest driver of traffic is Matt Drudge.\"[25]\nOn October 22, 2007, New York Times reporter Jim Rutenberg wrote that Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton, were cooperating with Drudge and \"working harder than ever to get favorable coverage for their candidates\u00a0\u2013 or unfavorable coverage of competitors\u00a0\u2013 onto the Drudge Report's home page, knowing that television producers, radio talk show hosts and newspaper reporters view it as a bulletin board for the latest news and gossip.\"[26] Rutenberg stated that Nielsen/NetRatings show that the Drudge Report gets three million unique visitors over the course of a month, or approximately one percent of the population of the United States.\nDuring the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, Drudge was described by some, including former presidential candidate Fred Thompson, as having a pro-Mitt Romney slant.[27]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nDrudge previously lived in Hollywood, California. As of 2007, he owned two properties in Miami, Florida\u00a0\u2013 a $1.4 million Mediterranean-style stucco house on Rivo Alto Island[1] and a $1 million-plus condominium in Miami's Four Seasons hotel.[7] By early 2009, Drudge earned millions of dollars a year, traveled extensively, and moved to another property in Miami. In 2003, he said his one indulgence, apart from travel, was his Corvette.[28]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\n\n\nIn every state and nearly every civilized nation in the developed world, readers know where to go for action and reaction of news\u00a0\u2013 at least one day ahead... Free from any corporate concerns, there are simply too many to thank since the site's inception in 1994. This new attempt at the old American experiment of full freedom in reporting is ever exciting. Those in power have everything to lose by individuals who march to their own rules.\n\n\n\u00a0\u2013The Drudge Report, Matt Drudge, on reaching one billion page views, 2002[29]\n\n\nThe Daily Telegraph has described Drudge as a conservative populist.[30]  In 1998, Drudge claimed that his politics are \"libertarian except for drugs and abortion\".[31] In 2001, he told the Miami New Times: \"I am a conservative. I'm very much pro-life. If you go down the list of what makes up a conservative, I'm there almost all the way.\"[32] In 2002, he described himself as \"Free from any Corporate Concerns\".[29] In a 2005 interview with The Sunday Times, Drudge described his politics: \"I'm not a right-wing Republican. I'm a conservative and want to pay less taxes. And I did vote Republican at the last election. But I'm more of a populist.\"[33]\n\nComments by journalists[edit]\nDrudge has been called \"the Walter Cronkite of his era\" by Mark Halperin and John F. Harris,[22] and \"the country's reigning mischief-maker\" by Todd Purdum of The New York Times.[34] Michael Isikoff of Newsweek said \"Drudge is a menace to honest, responsible journalism. And to the extent that he's read and people believe what they read, he's dangerous.\"[35] According to Camille Paglia, he is \"the kind of bold, entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, information-oriented outsider we need far more of in this country.\"[36] David McClintick described him as \"a modern Tom Paine, a possible precursor to millions of town criers using the Internet to invade the turf of bigfoot journalists.\"[37]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e Rasmussen Reports (2019). \"Matt Drudge May No Longer Be Editor of Drudge Report\".

(2019).\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nMatt Taibbi was born in 1970 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[2] Taibbi's father, Mike Taibbi, is an NBC television reporter whose biological mother was of mixed Filipino and Native Hawaiian descent, while his father was likely an American serviceman.[16] Mike Taibbi was adopted by an Italian-American couple in New York.[17] According to Taibbi, his surname is a Sicilian name of Lebanese origin; however, he is of neither Sicilian nor Lebanese descent because his father was adopted.[16][18][19] He has also claimed Irish descent through his mother.[20]\nTaibbi grew up in the Boston suburbs. His parents separated when he was young and he was largely raised by his mother. Because Taibbi was troubled with behavioral and academic problems, his parents sent him to Concord Academy.[14] He first attended New York University but was \"unable to deal with being just one of thousands of faces in a city of millions\" and transferred after his freshman year to Bard College, where he graduated in 1992.[21][14] He spent a year abroad studying at Leningrad Polytechnic University, where he finished his credits for graduation from Bard.[22][2]\n\nCareer[edit]\nEarly career[edit]\nIn the early 1990s, Taibbi moved from Saint Petersburg to Tashkent, Uzbekistan,[1] where he began selling news articles more regularly. He was deported in 1992 for writing an article for the Associated Press that was critical of President Islam Karimov. At the time of his deportation, Taibbi was the starting left fielder for the Uzbek national baseball team.[23][4]\nTaibbi moved to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, for a time in the 1990s, where he played professional basketball in the Mongolian Basketball Association (MBA).[24][2][1] Taibbi became known as \"The Mongolian Rodman\", was paid $100/month to play,[24] and said he also hosted a radio show while there.[25][26] He later contracted pneumonia and returned to Boston for surgery.[1][27]\nTaibbi also worked for a short time as an investigator at a Boston-based private detective agency.[5]\n\nRussia[edit]\nTaibbi first moved to Russia in 1992.[28] He lived and worked in Russia and the former USSR for more than six years. In 1997, he left the tabloid Living Here and joined Mark Ames to co-edit the English-language Moscow-based, bi-weekly free newspaper, The eXile,[2][1] which was written primarily for the city's expatriate community. The eXile's tone and content were highly controversial. For example, a regular column reported on a member of staff at The eXile hiring a Russian prostitute and then writing a long \"review\" of the woman and the details of the sexual encounter. Its content was considered either brutally honest and gleefully tasteless or juvenile, misogynistic, and even cruel.[29][30][31] In the US media during this time, Playboy magazine published pieces on Russia by Taibbi or by Taibbi and Ames.[citation needed]\nTaibbi wrote in English and Russian.[32] Apart from The eXile, Taibbi was also employed by the English-language newspaper The Moscow Times,[14] where he worked as a sports editor for five months.[33] He also contributed to Komsomolskaya Pravda, Trud, Stringer, and Kommersant.[34][32]\n\nThe Exile book[edit]\nTaibbi's first book, The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia, co-authored with Ames, was published in 2000.[35] A film based on the book was under development by producers Ted Hope and James Schamus of Good Machine but did not materialize.[36] He later stated that he was addicted to heroin while he did this early writing.[6]\nIn 2010, journalist James Verini wrote in Vanity Fair that during an interview in a Manhattan restaurant, he told Taibbi that The Exile was \"redundant and discursive\". Verini wrote that Taibbi became enraged, threw his coffee and a \"Fuck you!\" in Verini's face, followed him for half a block after he left the restaurant, and said \"I still haven't decided what I'm going to do with you!\"[6][37] Taibbi later described the incident as \"an aberration from how I've behaved in the last six or seven years\".[38][14]\nIn 2017, Taibbi was criticized for excerpts from a chapter written by Ames in the book The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia that described sexual harassment of employees at The eXile.[39] In a Facebook post responding to the controversy, Taibbi apologized for the \"cruel and misogynistic language\" used in the book, and said the work was conceived as a satire of the \"reprehensible\" behavior of American expatriates in Russia and that the description of events in the chapter was \"fictional and not true\". In 2017, the Washington Post published an article by journalist Kathy Lally about Taibbi and Ames' time at the eXile. Lally wrote that the \"eXile\u2019s distinguishing feature, more than anything else, was its blinding sexism \u2014 which often targeted [her]\" and that \"so many of their sins were real\".[40][41] Although the book presents itself as a work of non-fiction,[42] emails obtained by Paste in 2017 include a letter from the book's publisher stating that \"This book combines exaggerated, invented satire and nonfiction reporting and was categorized as nonfiction because there is no category for a book that is both.\"[43] Two women portrayed in the book told Paste magazine that none of the sexual harassment portrayed in the book \"[ever] happened\" and that it was a \"ridiculous passage written by Mark\".[43] Taibbi's publisher, Penguin Random House, dropped him after the controversy.[14]\n\nUnited States[edit]\nIn 2002, he returned to the United States to start the satirical bi-weekly The Beast in Buffalo, New York.[1] He left that publication a year later,[5] commenting: \"Running a business and writing is too much.\" Taibbi continued as a freelancer for The Nation,[1] Playboy, New York Press (where he wrote a regular political column for more than two years),[1] Rolling Stone,[1] and New York Sports Express (as editor-at-large).\nIn March 2005, Taibbi's satirical essay, \"The 52 Funniest Things About the Upcoming Death of the Pope\",[44] published in the New York Press, was denounced by Hillary Clinton, Michael Bloomberg, Matt Drudge, Abe Foxman, and Anthony Weiner. He left the paper in August 2005, shortly after his editor Jeff Koyen was forced out over the article.[45] Taibbi defended the piece as \"off-the-cuff burlesque of truly tasteless jokes,\" written to give his readers a break from a long run of his \"fulminating political essays\". Taibbi also said he was surprised at the vehement reactions to what he wrote \"in the waning hours of a Vicodin haze\".[46]\nIn February 2008, Taibbi contributed a three-minute segment to Real Time with Bill Maher in which he interviewed residents of Youngstown, Ohio before the Ohio primary.[47] He was invited as a guest on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show[48] and other MSNBC programs. He has also appeared on Democracy Now![49] and Chapo Trap House,[50] and served as a contributor on Countdown with Keith Olbermann.[51] Taibbi has appeared on the Thom Hartmann radio and television shows, and the Imus in the Morning Show on the Fox Business network.\nTaibbi wrote a column, \"The Sports Blotter\", for the free weekly newspaper, The Boston Phoenix.[26] He covered legal troubles involving professional and amateur athletes.[52]\n\nRolling Stone[edit]\nIn 2004, Taibbi began covering politics for Rolling Stone.[5] A contributing editor, he wrote feature-length articles on domestic and international affairs. He also wrote a weekly political online column, \"The Low Post\", for the magazine's website.[53]\n\nTaibbi in 2008\nTaibbi covered the 2008 United States presidential election in Year of the Rat, a special Rolling Stone diary.[54]\nAfter conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart died in March 2012, Taibbi wrote an obituary in Rolling Stone, entitled \"Andrew Breitbart: Death of a Douche\".[55][56] Taibbi also wrote: \"Good! Fuck him. I couldn't be happier that he's dead.\" He wrote that the obituary was \"at least half an homage\", which gave respect to aspects of Breitbart's style and also alluded to Breitbart's own derisive obituary of Ted Kennedy. In a postscript, Taibbi wrote that some fans of Breitbart were angered by the obituary and responded with \"threats and insults\".[55]\n\nFinancial journalism[edit]\nIn his reporting in the wake of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent Great Recession, Taibbi described Goldman Sachs as \"a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money\".[7][57] In financial and political media the expression \"Vampire Squids\" has come to represent the perception of the financial and investment sector as entities that \"sabotage production\" and \"sink the economy as they suck the life out of it in the form of rent.\"[58][7][59][60] Tackling the assistance to banks given in foreclosure courts, Taibbi traveled to Jacksonville, Florida to observe the \"rocket docket\". He was brought in to observe a hearing with attorney April Charney.[61] He concluded that it processed foreclosures without regard to the legality of the financial instruments being ruled upon, and sped up the process to enable quick resale of the properties, while obscuring the fraudulent and predatory nature of the loans.[62]\nIn February 2014, Taibbi left Rolling Stone and joined First Look Media to head a financial and political corruption-focused publication, Racket.[63] However, after management disputes with First Look's leadership delayed its launch and led to its cancellation, Taibbi returned to Rolling Stone the following October.[64][65]\n\nUseful Idiots[edit]\nIn August 2019, Taibbi launched a political podcast, Useful Idiots, co-hosted with Katie Halper and released through Rolling Stone.[66][67][68] The podcast has since featured interviews with various guests including Liz Franczak,[69] Andre Damon,[70] David Dayen,[71] Cornel West,[72] Glenn Greenwald,[73] and Aaron Mat\u00e9.[74]\nIn March 2021, Taibbi announced that Useful Idiots would no longer be released by Rolling Stone and would be moving to Substack.[75] With a few changes in program support staff, it is published by Substack as both audio and video that features both a free subscription and a paid subscription.\nIn January 2022, he announced a sabbatical leave to write a book, and that in his absence Aaron Mat\u00e9 would fill in for him.[76]\n\nSelf-publishing[edit]\nIn 2018, Taibbi began publishing a novel, The Business Secrets of Drug Dealing: Adventures of the Unidentified Black Male, as a serialized subscription via email and a website with an anonymous partner.[77] The novel is fictional with true-crime elements.[77]\n\nRacket News[edit]\nRacket News is a newsletter, blog, podcast, and book collection made available largely for free and the rest by subscription at www.racket.news.  In addition to Matt Taibbi, contributors include Jane Burn, Ford Fischer, Walter Kirn, and Eric Salzman. Other contributors are  Emily Bivens, Andrew Lowenthal, Jared Moore, cartoonist Daniel Medina, and Matt Orfalea.  \"America This Week,\" a news wrap up podcast and transcripts with Taibbi and Kirn, is posted weekly. [78] Racket News is published at the Substack online platform.\n\nHistory[edit]\nIn April 2020, Taibbi announced he would no longer publish his online writing through Rolling Stone, and henceforth, would publish his online writing independently through the e-mail newsletter service Substack. He stated that he would continue to contribute print features for Rolling Stone and maintain the Useful Idiots podcast with Katie Halper. (In April 2021, Useful Idiots, under its same name, but with some support staff changes, also would move to publication by Substack.) Taibbi stated that his decision to move his writing to the newsletter service was made independently and that he was not asked to leave Rolling Stone.[79][80] Taibbi branded his Substack newsletter TK news, after a term used in manuscript preparation for publication and journalism, TK, that stands for \"to come\", indicating that more will follow.[81] After a period of publication with free subscriptions only, Taibbi introduced an additional, paid subscription featuring content that will not be provided as part of the free subscriptions. As of October 2021, TK News had more than 30,000 paying subscribers.[14] On January 24, 2023 the name was changed from TK News to Racket News.\nOn August 12, 2022, the podcast America This Week was added to TK news. It is a weekly national news wrap-up with Taibbi and Walter Kirn, novelist and literary critic, that is released on Fridays. A transcript of the podcast is also published at Racket News. It is also available on Apple Podcasts.[82]\nTaibbi is one of the most popular writers on Substack and earns much more from the platform than he did writing for Rolling Stone.[83]\n\nTwitter Files[edit]\nMain article: Twitter Files\nOn December 2, 2022, Taibbi began tweeting about and screenshotting emails that executives of Twitter sent each other concerning content moderation in 2020. The emails were provided to Taibbi[disputed (for: emails were provided)\u00a0 \u2013 discuss] by Twitter CEO Elon Musk and documented parts of the discussions among Twitter's communication team about how Twitter should handle a New York Post article about a laptop computer that had been owned by Hunter Biden.[84][85][86][87] The documents, dubbed the \"Twitter Files\" and retweeted by CEO Elon Musk, were selected from \"thousands of internal documents obtained by sources at Twitter\".[84] Taibbi's report was in the form of a Twitter thread with screen shots of email exchanges between Twitter executives. Taibbi noted, \"in exchange for the opportunity to cover a unique and explosive story, I had to agree to certain conditions\" that he did not specify.[88][89]\nTaibbi's presentation largely confirmed what was already known and did not contain any significant new revelations.[90][91] Jeffrey Blehar, writing for National Review, said that Taibbi's reporting \"contained few, if any, explosive revelations for people who have been tuned in to the debacle surrounding Twitter's suppression of the New York Post story on Hunter Biden's laptop\".[92] Taibbi's thread included emails from Ro Khanna to former Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde, in which Khanna expressed concern about Twitter's decision to limit the circulation of the New York Post article about Hunter Biden. Khanna wrote that Twitter's actions violated \"1st Amendment principles\".[93]\nThe third installment, released on December 9, 2022, by Taibbi, highlighted events within Twitter leading to Donald Trump's suspension from Twitter.[94][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The sixth installment, released on December 16, 2022, by Taibbi, described how the FBI contacted Twitter to suggest that action be taken against several accounts for allegedly spreading election disinformation.[95][96][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Taibbi's ninth installment, released on December 24, 2022, relates to the CIA and FBI's alleged involvement in Twitter content moderation.[97][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The fifteenth installment, released on January 27, 2023, by Taibbi, reports on the Hamilton 68 Dashboard maintained by the Alliance for Securing Democracy.[98][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The sixteenth installment, released on February 18, 2023, by Taibbi, reports on messages to Twitter by Maine senator Angus King and U.S. State Department security engineer Mark Lenzi expressing concern regarding Twitter accounts they deemed suspicious.[99][non-primary source needed] The seventeenth installment, released on March 2, 2023, by Taibbi, reports on the Global Engagement Center, which was established by the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act.[100][non-primary source needed] The nineteenth installment of the Twitter Files, \"The Great Covid-19 Lie Machine, Stanford, the Virality Project, and the Censorship of \"True Stories\" raises questions about the government and social media censorship.[101]\nOn March 9, 2023, Taibbi testified, with Michael Shellenberger, before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government in a hearing on the Twitter Files.[102][103] Several Democrats at the hearing criticized both Taibbi and Shellenberger, including Stacey Plaskett, who referred to both as \"so-called journalists.\"[104]\nMehdi Hasan of MSNBC interviewed Taibbi on April 6, 2023, presenting several errors in the Twitter Files reporting. Taibbi asserted that these errors were trivial. The next day, Taibbi announced he was leaving Twitter within days in response to Twitter banning links to Substack after it announced its new feature Notes, which has been characterized as a competitor to Twitter. Elon Musk unfollowed Taibbi later that day.[105][106]\nTaibbi received a visit from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents the day he testified to Congress about the Twitter Files. Jim Jordan, chair of the house judiciary committee, has demanded that IRS turn over copies of documents related to its search.[107]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nSince the mid-2010s, Taibbi's reporting has increasingly focused on culture war topics and cancel culture. He has also criticized mainstream media and their coverage of Donald Trump and Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. His writing has since polarized readers and fellow journalists.[14]\n\nMedia[edit]\nTaibbi argues that both sides of the political media spectrum are complicit in dividing the country and fueling hate.[14] In 2019, Taibbi self-published the book Hate Inc., a critique of the mainstream media landscape.[108] Reviewing the book for Paste, Jason Rhode called it a \"brilliant indictment of American media\", praising the majority of the book but criticized Taibbi for \"[spending] a section of his book both-sidesing both MSNBC and FOX\".[109]\nDuring the Munk Debates on November 22, 2022, Taibbi and conservative Douglas Murray successfully argued in favor of the motion \"Be it resolved, don't trust Mainstream Media.\"[110]\nThey won by the largest margin ever recorded at a Munk Debate. They convinced 39% of the viewers disagreeing with them to adopt their viewpoint.[111][112]\nIn a June 2023 interview with The Hub, Taibbi said that \"I want the mainstream media to succeed. I think it needs to. The countries are not healthy if they don\u2019t have a functioning mass media and nobody believes them. And I think increasingly that's kind of the problem, is there's this lingering worsening trust issue that can only be addressed by dealing with some of the factual issues.\"[113] In October 2023, Taibbi was among the signatories of the Westminster Declaration, warning the public of an increasing censorship by governments and media companies, that would jeopardize freedom of speech.\n\nDonald Trump and Russian election interference[edit]\nUsing the term \"Russiagate\", Taibbi covered the story around Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and criticized the mainstream media coverage of the Special Counsel investigation.[114][115] Taibbi's book Hate Inc. includes a chapter, \"Why Russiagate Is This Generation's WMD\", in which he compares \"Russiagate\" to 2002\u20132003 allegations that Iraq had access to weapons of mass destruction, which were used by George W. Bush's administration as the most prominent rationale for the Iraq War.[116]\nIn October 2019, Taibbi argued that the whistleblower in the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal was not a \"real whistleblower\" because the whistleblower would have had their life affected by prosecution or being sent to prison.[117] Taibbi also quoted former CIA analyst Robert Baer who argued that the whistleblower was part of a \"palace coup against Trump.\"[117]\nIn response to the March 30, 2023 indictment of Donald Trump, Taibbi said, \"If presidents think they will be chased into jail under thin pretexts as ex-presidents, they'll try even harder to never leave office. This is how autocracies are born.\"[118]\n\nHunter Biden[edit]\nRegarding the Hunter Biden laptop controversy, Taibbi said that the problem \"is not even so much whether or not that story was important or whether it was terribly damning, it was more the behavior of the media during that story that was really troubling. Not just turning a blind eye to it being suppressed, but also as we found out, planning these what they call a tabletop exercise to 'How should we all respond when this story comes out?'\".[113][third-party source needed]\n\nAssessments[edit]\nIn 2021, Ross Barkan of New York Magazine wrote, \"Taibbi is \u2014 or was, depending on your view \u2014 one of the most celebrated investigative journalists of his generation.\" He continued, \"Taibbi's critics view him as a reporter turned red-pilled culture warrior chasing subscriptions\", while \"Taibbi's defenders say he hasn't changed. Rather, it's the world that has grown more illiberal and hysterical.\" Taibbi argued that he had not changed, but rather that reactions to Trump had \"fundamentally changed the business\".[14] In 2023, Nick Gillespie of Reason magazine wrote that when Taibbi attacked Hillary Clinton \"as a sellout, argued that the Russiagate narrative was mostly bullshit, and equated the manipulative tactics of right and left media personalities, progressives gave him the cold shoulder.\"[83]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nTaibbi is married to Jeanne,[2] a family physician.[119] They have three children.[120]\nTaibbi previously lived in Jersey City, New Jersey.[119] As of 2021, he lives in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey.[14]\nIn a 2008 interview with Hemant Mehta for Patheos, Taibbi described himself as an \"atheist/agnostic\".[121]\n\nAwards[edit]\n2008. The National Magazine Award in the category \"Columns and Commentary\" for Rolling Stone columns.[122]\n2009. The Sidney Award for \"The Great American Bubble Machine.\"[123]\n2020. The Izzy Award-- honors the independent journalism of I.F. Stone for work outside of corporate control. The Award is given by the Park Center for Independent Media at Ithaca College. Taibbi was honored \"for his exceptional stories on media bias in conservative and liberal news that culminated in his book, Hate, Inc.\" [124]\n2023. The inaugural Dao Prize of $100,000 for the \"Twitter Files\" to Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, and Michael Shellenberger.

Governor of Georgia in 1990. He served as Chairman of then-Speaker Newt Gingrich's political organization in the 1990s.[6][7][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nHe has appeared on news networks and on The O'Reilly Factor and Hardball with Chris Matthews and with hosts Sean Hannity and Bill Maher. In 2011 he served as a weekly guest commentator for CNN. He has been a political analyst for the Fox affiliate in Atlanta.[8]\nIn 2014, Towery predicted Donald Trump could become a serious contender for the U.S. presidency.[9][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] His polling company was one of few to predict a Trump win over Clinton in 2016.[4] Towery wrote a memo detailing the reasons he thought other pollsters were missing likely Trump voters, including over-representing Democrats and under-representing white men, and saying the other polls \"were being weighted based on a conventional turnout in a very unconventional year and there is a \u2018Trump vote\u2019 that most pollsters just are not able to capture.\"[4] Hannity read the memo on-air just before the election, which Trump won.[4]\nThe day before the 2020 US presidential election, Towery again predicted a win for Donald Trump, saying he believed other pollsters were missing \"the average guy on the street.\"[4] He also predicted that Trump would carry Georgia by seven percent, but Joe Biden narrowly won the state.\nAs of 2020 he was Of Counsel with Hall, Booth, Smith in their Atlanta office.[10][1]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nTowery lives with his wife in Atlanta, Georgia and Snell Isle in St. Petersburg, Florida.

His subsequent film roles include starring in Interstellar (2014) and The Gentlemen (2019), as well as voice work in Kubo and the Two Strings (2016), Sing (2016) and its sequel Sing 2 (2021).\n\n\nEarly life\nMcConaughey was born on November 4, 1969, in Uvalde, Texas.[6] His mother, Mary Kathleen  (n\u00e9e McCabe), is a published author and a former kindergarten teacher.[7] She was originally from Trenton, New Jersey.[8] His father, James Donald \"Jim\" McConaughey,[9] was born in Mississippi in 1929 and raised in Louisiana[10] where he ran an oil pipe supply business; he played for the Kentucky Wildcats and the Houston Cougars college football teams.[11] Jim was selected by the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL) in the 27th round of the 1953 NFL draft. He was released before the season began and never played an official league game in the NFL.[12] McConaughey's ancestry includes Irish roots, particularly from the County Cavan/County Monaghan area.[6] He is a relative of Confederate brigadier general Dandridge McRae.[13] He had a Methodist upbringing.[14]\nMcConaughey's parents married each other three times, having divorced each other twice.[15] He has two older brothers, Michael and Patrick (who was adopted).[16] Michael, nicknamed \"Rooster\", is a millionaire who starred in the CNBC docu-series West Texas Investors Club[17] and the 2018 A&E reality show Rooster & Butch with Wayne (Butch) Gilliam.[citation needed]\nMcConaughey moved to Longview, Texas, in 1980[8] and later attended Longview High School. In 1988 he went to Australia thinking he would be attending a high school in Sydney. Instead he lived in Warnervale, New South Wales for a year while he went to Gorokan High School (he was a Rotary Youth Exchange student) and worked as an assistant for an attorney and as a bank teller for ANZ.[18][19] He attended the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin), where he joined the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.[20] He began in the fall of 1989 and graduated in the spring of 1993 with a Bachelor of Science in Radio-Television-Film.[21]\nHis original plan changed as he had wanted to attend Southern Methodist University until one of his brothers told him that private-school tuition would have been a burden on the family's finances. He had planned to attend law school after graduation from college[22] but discovered he did not have any interest in becoming a lawyer.[8]\n\nCareer\nEarly 1990s to 2000: Breakthrough and rise to prominence\nIn the early 1990s McConaughey began working in television commercials.[23]\nIn 1992, he was cast as the boyfriend in the music video for \"Walkaway Joe\", a song by Trisha Yearwood featuring Don Henley.[24] Also that year, he acted in an episode of Unsolved Mysteries.[25]\nBob Balaban's My Boyfriend's Back premiered on August 6, 1993, where McConaughey made his first big screen appearance as ''Guy 2''.[26] On September 24, Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused premiered.[27] McConaughey played Wooderson in a large ensemble cast of actors who would later become stars. He was not originally cast in the film, as the role of Wooderson was originally small and meant to be cast locally for budget purposes. At the time of casting, he was a film student at the University of Texas in Austin and went out with his girlfriend to the Hyatt hotel bar.[28] He approached casting director Don Phillips.[29] Phillips recalls, \"The bartender says to him, 'See that guy down there? That's Don Phillips. He cast Sean Penn in Fast Times.' And Matthew goes, 'I'm gonna go down and talk to this guy.'\" Phillips also recalls that Linklater didn't like McConaughey at first \"because he was too handsome\". During production, another character named Pickford was meant to be a larger role. Due to the behavior of the actor playing Pickford with other cast members, his screen time was cut in favor of McConaughey's character, Wooderson. Linklater recalled \"There was another actor who was kind of the opposite [of McConaughey]. He wasn't really getting along with everybody. I could tell the actors weren't responding to him.\"[30] Much of the Wooderson role was improvised or written on the spot.[30] Dazed and Confused was released on September 24, 1993, in 183 theaters, grossing $918,127 on its opening weekend. It went on to make $7.9 million in North America.[31] The film received positive reviews from critics. The film generally gets favorable reviews.[32] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 92% approval rating.

Jackson, and Kevin Spacey share the top billing. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 67%. The critics' consensus reads: \"Overlong and superficial, A Time to Kill nonetheless succeeds on the strength of its skillful craftsmanship and top-notch performances\".[40] In the U.S. it reached number one during its first two weeks and grossed over $108 million domestically, and an additional $43,500,000 was made internationally.[41] At the MTV Movie Awards, McConaughey won Best Breakthrough Performance.[42] Larger Than Life is a road comedy film starring Bill Murray and directed by Howard Franklin; McConaughey played a supporting role.[43] Also that year he acted in Glory Daze.[44] McConaughey starred in the science fiction film  Contact (1997), directed by Robert Zemeckis, an adaptation of Carl Sagan's 1985 novel of the same name; Sagan and his wife Ann Druyan wrote the story outline for the film.

But believe me, I noticed there were other things that were not coming in. And if they were coming in, it was in an independent form with a much smaller paycheck, and nobody really wanting to get behind them ... But I knew I could say no to the things I'd been doing. In saying no to those things, I knew work was going to dry up for awhile ... Year and a half, still nothing. At two years, all of a sudden, in my opinion, I became a new good idea for some good directors.[61]\n2011 to 2014: Established actor\nMcConaughey at the 83rd Academy Awards in 2011\nIn 2012, McConaughey starred alongside Channing Tatum in Magic Mike, based on Tatum's early life; it was directed by Steven Soderbergh.[63] He returned to his East Texas roots, working again with director Richard Linklater on Bernie, playing district attorney Danny Buck Davidson.[64] In June 2012, McConaughey was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[65]\nIn 2013 he portrayed Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyers Club.

In November 2020,[4] he left his position as an editor and columnist at the news website Vox, which he co-founded in 2014, to publish the Substack newsletter Slow Boring. He is currently a Senior Fellow at the Niskanen Center.[5]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nYglesias's father Rafael Yglesias is a screenwriter and novelist, and he has a brother named Nicolas. His paternal grandparents were novelists Jose Yglesias and Helen Yglesias (n\u00e9e Bassine). His paternal grandfather was of Cuban and Spanish Galician descent, and his three other grandparents were of Eastern European Jewish descent.[6]\nYglesias went to high school at the Dalton School in New York City. He attended Harvard University, where he was editor in chief of The Harvard Independent and graduated in 2003 with a B.A. magna cum laude in philosophy.[7][8]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nYglesias is married to Kate Crawford. Yglesias and Crawford met in 2008, and have one son together. Crawford now serves as editor for his Slow Boring newsletter.[9]\n\nCareer[edit]\nEarly career[edit]\nYglesias started blogging in early 2002, while still in college, focusing mainly on American politics and public policy issues, often approached from an abstract, philosophical perspective.\nYglesias joined the American Prospect as a writing fellow upon his graduation in 2003, subsequently becoming a staff writer. His posts appeared regularly on the magazine's collaborative weblog TAPPED.[10]\nFrom June 2007 until August 2008, he was a staff writer at The Atlantic Monthly, and his blog was hosted on the magazine's website, The Atlantic. In July 2008, he announced that he would leave The Atlantic Monthly for the Center for American Progress where he wrote for its blog, ThinkProgress, because he missed \"the sense of collegiality that comes from working with like-minded colleagues on a shared enterprise\" and thought he could \"help advance their mission.\"[11] On November 21, 2011, he left ThinkProgress to work as a business and economics correspondent at Slate's Moneybox.[12][13]\n\nVox[edit]\nIn February 2014, he left Slate and joined Vox Media to co-found Vox with Ezra Klein and Melissa Bell.[14] On November 13, 2020, Yglesias announced that he would no longer be writing for Vox.com.[15] Yglesias moved to Substack for editorial independence.[16]\n\nControversy[edit]\nIn 2013, Yglesias garnered controversy for his statements about the 2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse, with Yglesias arguing that the lower building standards that partially led to the factory's collapse make \"economic sense\"[17] in developing countries, later tweeting that \"foreign factories should be more dangerous than American factories\"[18][19] and \"the current system of letting different countries have different rules is working fine.\"[20] His comments were widely criticized in The Daily Beast,[21] Time[22] and other outlets,[23][24] with The Guardian commenting that Yglesias is \"confusing a person's human worth with their socio-economic status. That's wrong.\"[25] Yglesias later clarified some of his comments, but stood by his original position.[26]\nYglesias deleted his past Twitter feed in November 2018, after controversy over tweets which defended the motivation of protesters who gathered outside the house of Tucker Carlson. The tweets also expressed a lack of empathy for Carlson's wife, which caused outrage.[27][28][29]\n\nBooks[edit]\nYglesias authored the political nonfiction book One Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger, released on September 15, 2020.[30] It was inspired by Doug Saunders' Maximum Canada.[31] According to an analysis by British digital strategist Rob Blackie, Yglesias was one of the most commonly followed political writers among Biden administration staff on Twitter.[32]\nAndrew Sullivan, a fellow blogger, takes nominations on his blog for the Yglesias Award, an honor \"for writers, politicians, columnists or pundits who actually criticize their own side, make enemies among political allies, and generally risk something for the sake of saying what they believe.\"[33][34]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nIn 2011, The Economist noted that Yglesias has been accused of espousing \"left-leaning neoliberalism\" in his writing.[35] In 2017, Vice listed Yglesias among a group of political writers who were attached with a \"neoliberal shill\" label in left-wing Twitter communities.[36] Yglesias himself embraced the \"neoliberal shill\" label in a 2019 podcast.[37]\nIn 2002, Yglesias was a strong supporter of invading Iraq, Iran and North Korea, calling the countries on his blog \"evil\" and stating that \"we should take them all out\", although he was critical of the term \"axis of evil\".[38][39] In 2010, he called his attitudes about the war a mistake.[40]\nIn or before 2010, Yglesias coined the term \"pundit's fallacy\" to denote \"the belief that what a politician needs to do to improve his or her political standing is do what the pundit wants substantively.\"[41][42][43] In 2012, Yglesias stated that he voted for Mitt Romney when he won the office for governor of Massachusetts in 2002.[44]\n\nWorks[edit]\nHeads in the Sand: How the Republicans Screw Up Foreign Policy and Foreign Policy Screws Up the Democrats, Wiley, April 2008, ISBN\u00a0978-0-470-08622-3.[45]\n\"Long Philosophical Rant about Spider-Man 2\", Ultimate blogs: masterworks from the wild Web, Editor Sarah Boxer, Random House, Inc., 2008, ISBN\u00a0978-0-307-27806-7\n\"The Media\", The 12-Step Bush Recovery Program, Gene Stone, Carl Pritzkat, Tony Travostino, Random House, Inc., 2008, ISBN\u00a0978-0-8129-8036-3\nThe Rent Is Too Damn High, Simon and Schuster, March 2012, ASIN B0078XGJXO\nOne Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger, Portfolio Penguin, September 2020, ISBN\u00a0978-0-593-19021-0.\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Yglesias, Matthew [@mattyglesias] (April 17, 2021). \"They say the nanobots take two weeks to be fully operational\" (Tweet).
