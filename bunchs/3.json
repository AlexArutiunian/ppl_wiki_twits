She became known as a media pundit in the late 1990s, appearing in print and on cable news as an outspoken critic of the Clinton administration. Her first book concerned the impeachment of Bill Clinton and sprang from her experience writing legal briefs for Paula Jones's attorneys, as well as columns she wrote about the cases.[2] Coulter's syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate appears in newspapers and is featured on conservative websites. Coulter has also written 13 books.[3]\n\n\nEarly life\nCoulter as a senior in high school, 1980\nAnn Hart Coulter was born on December 8, 1961,[4] in New York City, to John Vincent Coulter (1926\u20132008), an FBI agent from a working class Catholic Irish American and German American family[5] in Albany, New York, and Nell Husbands Coulter (n\u00e9e Martin; 1928\u20132009), who was born in Paducah, Kentucky.\nCoulter's mother's ancestry has been traced back on both sides of her family to a group of Puritan settlers in Plymouth Colony, British America arriving on the Griffin with Thomas Hooker in 1633,[6] and her father's family were Catholic Irish and German immigrants who arrived in America in the 19th century. Her father's Irish ancestors emigrated during the famine[5]\u2014and became ship laborers, tilemakers, brickmakers, carpenters and flagmen. Coulter's father attended college on the GI Bill, and would later idolize Joseph McCarthy.[7]\nShe has two older brothers: James, an accountant,[8] and John, an attorney.[9] Her family later moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, where Coulter and her two brothers were raised.[10] Coulter graduated from New Canaan High School in 1980.[11]\nWhile attending Cornell University, Coulter helped found The Cornell Review,[12] and was a member of the Delta Gamma national sorority.[13] She graduated cum laude from Cornell in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and received her Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1988, where she was an editor of the Michigan Law Review.[14] At Michigan, Coulter was president of the local chapter of the Federalist Society and was trained at the National Journalism Center.[15]\nCoulter's age was disputed in 2002. While she argued that she was not yet 40, The Washington Post columnist Lloyd Grove cited a birthdate of December 8, 1961, which Coulter provided when registering to vote in New Canaan, Connecticut, prior to the 1980 Presidential election, for which she had to be 18 years old to register. A driver's license issued several years later purportedly listed her birthdate as December 8, 1963. Coulter will not confirm either date, citing privacy concerns.[16]\n\nCareer\nAfter law school, Coulter served as a law clerk, in Kansas City, for Judge Pasco Bowman\u00a0II of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.[17] After a short time working in New York City in private practice, where she specialized in corporate law, Coulter left to work for the United States Senate Judiciary Committee after the Republican Party took control of Congress in 1994. She handled crime and immigration issues for Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan and helped craft legislation designed to expedite the deportation of aliens convicted of felonies.[18] She later became a litigator with the Center for Individual Rights.[19]\nCoulter has written 13 books, and also publishes a syndicated newspaper column. She is particularly known for her polemical style,[20] and describes herself as someone who likes to \"stir up the pot. I don't pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do\".[21]\nShe idolized Clare Boothe Luce for her satirical style.[22] She also makes numerous public appearances, speaking on television and radio talk shows, as well as on college campuses, receiving both praise and protest. Coulter typically spends 6 to 12 weeks of the year on speaking engagement tours, and more when she has a book coming out.[23]\nIn 2010, she made an estimated $500,000 on the speaking circuit, giving speeches on topics of modern conservatism, gay marriage, and what she describes as the hypocrisy of modern American liberalism.[24] During one appearance at the University of Arizona, a pie was thrown at her.[25][26][27] In defense of her ideas, Coulter has on occasion responded with inflammatory remarks toward hecklers and protestors who attend her speeches.[28][29]\n\nBooks\nAnn Coulter at the 2004 Republican National Convention\nCoulter is the author of twelve books, including many that have appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list, with a combined 3 million copies sold as of May\u00a02009[update].[30]\nCoulter's first book, High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton, was published by Regnery Publishing in 1998 and made The New York Times Bestseller list.[2] It details Coulter's case for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\nHer second book, Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right, published by Crown Forum in 2002, reached the number one spot on The New York Times non-fiction best seller list.[31] In Slander, Coulter argues that President George W. Bush was given unfair negative media coverage. The factual accuracy of Slander was called into question by then-comedian and author, later Democratic U.S. Senator from Minnesota, Al Franken; he also accused her of citing passages out of context.[32] Others investigated these charges, and also raised questions about the book's accuracy and presentation of facts.[33][34] Coulter responded to criticisms in a column called \"Answering My Critics\".[35]\nIn her third book, Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism, also published by Crown Forum, she reexamines the 60-year history of the Cold War\u00a0\u2013 including the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Whittaker Chambers-Alger Hiss affair, and Ronald Reagan's challenge to Mikhail Gorbachev to \"tear down this wall\"\u2014and argues that liberals were wrong in their Cold War political analyses and policy decisions, and that McCarthy was correct about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government.[36]\nShe also argues that the correct identification of Annie Lee Moss, among others, as communists was misreported by the liberal media.[37]\nTreason was published in 2003, and spent 13 weeks on the Best Seller list.[38]\nCrown Forum published a collection of Coulter's columns in 2004 as her fourth book, How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter.[39]\nCoulter's fifth book, published by Crown Forum in 2006, is Godless: The Church of Liberalism.[40]\nIn it, she argues, first, that American liberalism rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, and second, that it bears all the attributes of a religion itself.[41]\nGodless debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller list.[42]\nCoulter's If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans (Crown Forum), published in October 2007, and Guilty: Liberal \"Victims\" and Their Assault on America (Crown Forum), published on January 6, 2009, both also achieved best-seller status.[43]\nOn June 7, 2011, Crown Forum published her eighth book Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America.[44]\nHer ninth book, published September 25, 2012, was Mugged: Racial Demagoguery from the Seventies to Obama. It argues that liberals, and Democrats in particular, have taken undue credit for racial civil rights in America.[45]\nCoulter's tenth book, Never Trust a Liberal Over 3 \u2013 Especially a Republican, was released on October 14, 2013. It is her second collection of columns and her first published by Regnery since her first book, High Crimes and Misdemeanors.[46] Coulter published her eleventh book, Adios, America: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole, on June 1, 2015. The book addresses illegal immigration, amnesty programs, and border security in the United States.[47]\n\nColumns\nIn the late 1990s, Coulter's weekly (biweekly from 1999 to 2000) syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate began appearing. Her column is featured on six conservative websites: Human Events Online, WorldNetDaily, Townhall.com, VDARE, FrontPage Magazine, Jewish World Review and her own website. Her syndicator says, \"Ann's client newspapers stick with her because she has a loyal fan base of conservative readers who look forward to reading her columns in their local newspapers\".[48]\nIn 1999, Coulter worked as a columnist for George magazine.[49][50] Coulter also wrote weekly columns for the conservative magazine Human Events between 1998 and 2003, with occasional columns thereafter. In her columns, she discussed judicial rulings, constitutional issues, and legal matters affecting Congress and the executive branch.[51]\nIn 2001, as a contributing editor and syndicated columnist for National Review Online (NRO), Coulter was asked by editors to make changes to a piece written after the September 11 attacks. On the show Politically Incorrect, Coulter accused NRO of censorship and said she was paid $5 per article. NRO dropped her column and terminated her editorship. Jonah Goldberg, the editor-at-large of NRO, said: \"We did not 'fire' Ann for what she wrote... we ended the relationship because she behaved with a total lack of professionalism, friendship, and loyalty [concerning the editing disagreement].\"[52]\nIn August 2005, the Arizona Daily Star dropped Coulter's syndicated column, citing reader complaints: \"Many readers find her shrill, bombastic, and mean-spirited. And those are the words used by readers who identified themselves as conservatives\".[53]\nIn July 2006, some newspapers replaced Coulter's column with those of other conservative columnists following the publication of her fourth book, Godless: The Church of Liberalism.[54] After The Augusta Chronicle dropped her column, newspaper editor Michael Ryan said: \"it came to the point where she was the issue rather than what she was writing about.\"[55] Ryan added that he continued himself \"to be an Ann Coulter fan\" as \"her logic is devastating and her viewpoint is right most of the time.\"[55]\n\nTelevision and radio\nAnn Coulter at the 2012 Time 100\nCoulter made her first national media appearance in 1996 after she was hired by the then-fledgling network MSNBC as a legal correspondent. She later appeared on CNN and Fox News,[56] and went on to make frequent guest appearances on many television and radio talk shows.\n\nPolitical views\nThis article is part of a series onConservatismin the United States\nSchools\nCompassionate\nFiscal\nFusion\nLibertarian\nModerate\nMovement\nNeo\nPaleo\nProgressive\nSocial\nTraditionalist\n\n\nPrinciples\nAmerican exceptionalism\nAnti-communism\nChristian nationalism\nClassical liberalism\nConstitutionalism\nFamily values\nJudeo-Christian values\nLimited government\nMilitarism\nMoral absolutism\nNatural law\nPatriotism\nRepublicanism\nRight to bear arms\nRule of law\nTradition\n\n\nHistory\nConservative coalition\nConservative Democrat\nConservative Manifesto\nLoyalists\nMcCarthyism\nModern timeline\nNew Right\nOld Right\nOverview\nReagan Doctrine\nReaganomics\nStalwart Republicans\nSouthern Agrarians\n\n\nIntellectuals\nBabbitt\nBoorstin\nBozell Jr.\nBuchanan\nBuckley\nBurnham\nChambers\nDolan\nEliot\nGeorge\nGoldberg\nGottfried\nHanson\nHazony\nHoppe\nJaffa\nKirk\nKirkpatrick\nKreeft\nKristol (Bill)\nKristol (Irving)\nKuehnelt-Leddihn\nLaffer\nLasch\nLodge\nLovecraft\nLukacs\nMansfield\nMeese\nMeyer\nNisbet\nNock\nPodhoretz\nRansom\nSantayana\nSowell\nStrauss\nViereck\nVoegelin\nWashington\nWeaver\nWill\n\n\nPoliticians\nAbbott\nAdams\nQuincy Adams\nAgnew\nBuchanan\nBush (George H.

Pederasty acceptable only for refugees and illegals. Then libs will support you.\"[62]\n\nAbortion\nCoulter opposed abortion rights and supported the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling, which overturned the Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey precedent She describes herself as an \"anti-abortion zealot\". She believes abortion, excluding abortion exceptions in cases of fetal impairment, rape and danger to a woman's life or health, should be illegal in most other cases. [63][64]\n\nChristianity\nCoulter was raised by a Catholic father and Protestant mother.[65] At one public lecture she said: \"I don't care about anything else; Christ died for my sins, and nothing else matters.\"[66]\nConfronting some critics' views that her content and style of writing is unchristian,[67] Coulter said that she is \"a Christian first and a mean-spirited, bigoted conservative second, and don't you ever forget it.\"[68] Six years later, in 2011, she also said \"Christianity fuels everything I write.\"[69]\n\nEvolution\nIn Godless: The Church of Liberalism, Coulter characterized the theory of evolution as bogus science, and contrasted her beliefs to what she called the left's \"obsession with Darwinism and the Darwinian view of the world, which replaces sanctification of life with sanctification of sex and death\".[70] Coulter advocates intelligent design, a pseudoscientific antievolution ideology.[71][72]\n\nCivil liberties\nCoulter endorsed the NSA's Terrorist Surveillance Program directed at Al-Qaeda.[73] During a 2011 appearance on Stossel, she said \"PATRIOT Act, fantastic, Gitmo, fantastic, waterboarding, not bad, though torture would've been better.\"[74] She criticized Rand Paul for \"this anti-drone stuff\".[75]\nCoulter opposes hate crime laws, calling them \"unconstitutional\". She also stated that \"Hate-crime provisions seem vaguely directed at capturing a sense of cold-bloodedness, but the law can do that without elevating some victims over others.\"[76]\n\nCivil rights\nAlthough Coulter supported the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, she is critical of desegregation busing, which she calls \"forced busing\" and desegregation court rulings since Brown v. Board of Education.[77][78] She supports literacy tests for voting, which she claims are not unconstitutional or prohibited in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[79] She supports the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[80]\n\nImmigration\nCoulter has criticized former president George W. Bush's immigration proposals. In a 2007 column, she claimed that the current immigration system was set up to deliberately reduce the percentage of whites in the population. In it, she said:[81]\nCoulter opposes the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.[82] She strongly opposed amnesty for undocumented immigrants, and at the 2013 CPAC said she had become \"a single-issue voter against amnesty\".[83]\nIn June 2018, during the controversy caused by the Trump administration family separation policy, Coulter dismissed immigrant children as \"child actors weeping and crying\" and urged Trump not to \"fall for it\".[84]\nCoulter is an advocate of the white genocide conspiracy theory.[85][86][87] She has compared non-white immigration into the United States with genocide,[88] and claiming that \"a genocide\" is occurring against South African farmers,[89] she has said that the Boers are the \"only real refugees\" in South Africa.[90][91] Regarding domestic politics, Vox labelled Coulter as one of many providing a voice for \"the 'white genocide' myth\",[92] and the SPLC covered Coulter's remarks that if the demographic changes occurring in the U.S. were being \"legally imposed on any group other than white Americans, it would be called genocide\".[93][81]\n\nLGBT rights\nCoulter opposes same-sex marriage, opposes Obergefell v. Hodges, and supports, after previously saying she did not, a federal U.S. constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman.[94][95] She claims her opposition to same-sex marriage \"wasn't an anti-gay thing\" and that \"It's genuinely a pro-marriage position to oppose gay marriage\".[96] Coulter claims that same-sex marriage would \"ruin gay culture\", because \"gays value promiscuous sex over monogamy\".[97]\nCoulter also opposes civil unions[98] and privatizing marriage.[99] When addressed with the issue of rights granted by marriage, she said, \"Gays already can visit loved ones in hospitals. They can also visit neighbors, random acquaintances, and total strangers in hospitals\u2014just like everyone else. Gays can also pass on property to whomever they would like\".[100] She also stated that same-sex sexual intercourse was already protected under the Fourth Amendment, which prevents police from going into your home without a search warrant or court order.[101]\nCoulter disagreed with repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, stating that it is not an \"anti-gay position; it is a pro-military position\" because \"sexual bonds are disruptive to the military bond\".[102] She also stated that there is \"no proof that all the discharges for homosexuality involve actual homosexuals.\"[103]\nCoulter has expressed her opposition to treatment of LGBT people in the countries of Cuba, China, and Saudi Arabia.[104][105]\nSince the 1990s, Coulter has had many acquaintances in the LGBT community. She describes herself as \"the Judy Garland of the Right\", reflecting Garland's large fan base from the gay community. In the last few years before 2015 she attracted LGBT fans, namely gay men and drag queens.[97][106]\nAt the 2007 CPAC, Coulter said, \"I do want to point out one thing that has been driving me crazy with the media\u2014how they keep describing Mitt Romney's position as being pro-gays, and that's going to upset the right wingers\", and \"Well, you know, screw you! I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against.\" She added, \"I don't know why all gays aren't Republican. I think we have the pro-gay positions, which is anti-crime and for tax cuts. Gays make a lot of money and they're victims of crime. No, they are! They should be with us.\"[107]\nIn Coulter's 2007 book If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans, in the chapter \"Gays: No Gay Left Behind!\", she argued that Republican policies were more pro-gay than Democratic policies. Coulter attended the 2010 HomoCon of GOProud, where she gave a speech about why gays should oppose same-sex marriage.[108]\nAt the 2011 CPAC, during her question-and-answer segment, Coulter was asked about GOProud and the controversy over their inclusion at the 2011 CPAC. She boasted how she talked GOProud into dropping its support for same-sex marriage in the party's platform, saying, \"The left is trying to co-opt gays, and I don't think we should let them. I think they should be on our side\", and \"Gays are natural conservatives\".[109] Later that year, she joined advisory board for GOProud. On Logos The A-List: Dallas she told gay Republican Taylor Garrett that \"The gays have got to be pro-life\", and \"As soon as they find the gay gene, guess who the liberal yuppies are gonna start aborting?\"[110]\n\nWar on Drugs\nCoulter strongly supports continuing the War on Drugs.[111] However, she has said that, if there were not a welfare state, she \"wouldn't care\" if drugs were legal.[112] She spoke about drugs as a guest on Piers Morgan Live, where she said that marijuana users \"can't perform daily functions\".[113]\n\nBernie Sanders\nIn April 2019, Coulter said of Senator Bernie Sanders she would vote and perhaps even work for him in the 2020 U.S. presidential election if he stuck to his \"original position\" on U.S. border policy. \"If he went back to his original position, which is the pro blue-collar position\u2014I mean, it totally makes sense with him\", and \"If he went back to that position, I'd vote for him, I might work for him. I don't care about the rest of the socialist stuff. Just, can we do something for ordinary Americans?\"[114][115]\n\nPolitical activities and commentary\nThis article needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2018)\nAnn Coulter has described herself as a \"polemicist\" who likes to \"stir up the pot\" and does not \"pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do\".[116] While her political activities in the past have included advising a plaintiff suing President Bill Clinton as well as considering a run for Congress, she mostly serves as a political pundit, sometimes creating controversy ranging from rowdy uprisings at some of the colleges where she speaks to protracted discussions in the media.\nTime magazine's John Cloud once observed that Coulter \"likes to shock reporters by wondering aloud whether America might be better off if women lost the right to vote\".[56] This was in reference to her statement that \"it would be a much better country if women did not vote. That is simply a fact. In fact, in every presidential election since 1950\u2014except Goldwater in '64\u2014the Republican would have won, if only the men had voted.\"[58] Similarly, in an October 2007 interview with The New York Observer, Coulter said:[117]\n\nIf we took away women's right to vote, we'd never have to worry about another Democrat president. It's kind of a pipe dream, it's a personal fantasy of mine, but I don't think it's going to happen. And it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly, at least single women.\nIt also makes the point, it is kind of embarrassing, the Democratic Party ought to be hanging its head in shame, that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it. I mean, you do see it's the party of women and 'We'll pay for health care and tuition and day care\u2014and here, what else can we give you, soccer moms?'\nCoulter has also appeared on Fox News and advocated for a poll tax and a literacy test for voters (this was in 1999, and she reiterated her support of a literacy test in 2015).[118]\n\nPaula Jones \u2013 Bill Clinton case\nCoulter first became a public figure shortly before becoming an unpaid legal adviser for the attorneys representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit against President Bill Clinton. Coulter's friend George Conway had been asked to assist Jones' attorneys, and shortly afterward Coulter, who wrote a column about the Paula Jones case for Human Events, was also asked to help, and she began writing legal briefs for the case.\nCoulter later stated that she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to settle, if a favorable settlement could be negotiated.[18][119] From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement.[120] However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would give the impression that Jones was merely interested in extorting money from the President.[18]\nDavid Daley, who wrote the interview piece for The Hartford Courant recounted what followed:\n\nCoulter played one particularly key role in keeping the Jones case alive. In Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff's new book Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story, Coulter is unmasked as the one who leaked word of Clinton's \"distinguishing characteristic\"\u2014his reportedly bent penis that Jones said she could recognize and describe\u2014to the news media. Her hope was to foster mistrust between the Clinton and Jones camps and forestall a settlement ... I thought if I leaked the distinguishing characteristic it would show bad faith in negotiations. [Clinton lawyer] Bob Bennett would think Jones had leaked it. Cammaratta would know he himself hadn't leaked it and would get mad at Bennett. It might stall negotiations enough for me to get through to [Jones adviser] Susan Carpenter-McMillan to tell her that I thought settling would hurt Paula, that this would ruin her reputation, and that there were other lawyers working for her. Then 36 hours later, she returned my phone call. I just wanted to help Paula. I really think Paula Jones is a hero. I don't think I could have taken the abuse she came under. She's this poor little country girl and she has the most powerful man she's ever met hitting on her sexually, then denying it and smearing her as president. And she never did anything tacky. It's not like she was going on TV or trying to make a buck out of it.\"[18]\nIn his book, Isikoff also reported Coulter as saying: \"We were terrified that Jones would settle. It was contrary to our purpose of bringing down the President.\"[119] After the book came out, Coulter clarified her stated motives, saying:\n\nThe only motive for leaking the distinguishing characteristic item that [Isikoff] gives in his book is my self-parodying remark that \"it would humiliate the president\" and that a settlement would foil our efforts to bring down the president ... I suppose you could take the position, as [Isikoff] does, that we were working for Jones because we thought Clinton was a lecherous, lying scumbag, but this argument gets a bit circular. You could also say that Juanita Broaddrick's secret motive in accusing Clinton of rape is that she hates Clinton because he raped her. The whole reason we didn't much like Clinton was that we could see he was the sort of man who would haul a low-level government employee like Paula to his hotel room, drop his pants, and say, \"Kiss it.\" You know: Everything his defense said about him at the impeachment trial. It's not like we secretly disliked Clinton because of his administration's position on California's citrus cartels or something, and then set to work on some crazy scheme to destroy him using a pathological intern as our Mata Hari.[121]\nThe case went to court after Jones broke with Coulter and her original legal team, and it was dismissed via summary judgment. The judge ruled that even if her allegations proved true, Jones did not show that she had suffered any damages, stating, \"... plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal to submit to the governor's alleged advances. The president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment.\" The ruling was appealed by Jones' lawyers. During the pendency of the appeal, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 ($151,000 after legal fees) in November 1998, in exchange for Jones' dismissal of the appeal. By then, the Jones lawsuit had given way to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.\nIn October 2000, Jones revealed that she would pose for nude pictures in an adult magazine, saying she wanted to use the money to pay taxes and support her grade-school-aged children, in particular saying, \"I'm wanting to put them through college and maybe set up a college fund.\"[122] Coulter publicly denounced Jones, calling her \"the trailer-park trash they said she was\" (Coulter had earlier chastened Clinton supporters for calling Jones this name),[123] after Clinton's former campaign strategist James Carville had made the widely reported remark, \"Drag a $100 bill through a trailer park, and you'll never know what you'll find\", and called Jones a \"fraud, at least to the extent of pretending to be an honorable and moral person\".[122]\nCoulter wrote:\n\nPaula surely was given more than a million dollars in free legal assistance from an array of legal talent she will never again encounter in her life, much less have busily working on her behalf. Some of those lawyers never asked for or received a dime for hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal work performed at great professional, financial and personal cost to themselves. Others got partial payments out of the settlement. But at least they got her reputation back. And now she's thrown it away.[124] Jones claimed not to have been offered any help with a book deal of her own or any other additional financial help after the lawsuit.[122]\n2013 CPAC Conference\nIn March 2013, Coulter was one of the keynote speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where she made references to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's weight (\"CPAC had to cut back on its speakers this year about 300 pounds\") and progressive activist Sandra Fluke's hairdo. (Coulter quipped that Fluke didn't need birth control pills because \"that haircut is birth control enough\".) Coulter advocated against a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants because such new citizens would never vote for Republican candidates: \"If amnesty goes through, America becomes California and no Republican will ever win another election.\"[125][126]\n\nVDARE\nSince 2013, Coulter has been a contributor to VDARE, a far-right website and blog founded by anti-immigration activist and paleo-conservative Peter Brimelow.[127] Michael Malice has said that \"Coulter and VDARE can be considered the furthest edge of the Overton Window\" as any political position further to the right would be too heretical to find mainstream success.[128] VDARE is controversial because of its alleged white supremacist rhetoric and support of scientific racism and white nationalism.[129]\n\nCandidate endorsements\nCoulter initially supported George W. Bush's presidency, but later criticized its approach to immigration. She endorsed Duncan Hunter[130] and later Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primaries[131] and the 2012 Republican presidential primary and presidential run.[132] In the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, she endorsed Donald Trump.[133]  Coulter later distanced herself from Trump following arguments over immigration policies; she called for his impeachment in September 2017, saying \"Put a fork in Trump, he's dead\".[134] She described herself in 2018 as a \"former Trumper\";[135] in a 2020 speech to a Turning Point USA event, she said, \"The Trump agenda without Trump would be a lot easier. Our new motto should be 'Going on with Trumpism without Trump.' That's a winning strategy.\"[136] Coulter blamed Trump's son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner for Trump's 2020 election loss, and said that Trump had failed to deliver for the white working class.[137]\nOther candidates Coulter has endorsed include Greg Brannon (2014 Republican primary candidate for North Carolina Senator),[138] Paul Nehlen (2016 Republican primary candidate for Wisconsin's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives),[139] Mo Brooks (2017 Republican primary candidate for Alabama Senator), and Roy Moore (2017 Republican candidate for Alabama Senator).[140]\n\nControversies\nComments on Islam, Arabs, and terrorism\nCoulter's September 14, 2001, column eulogized her friend Barbara Olson, killed three days earlier in the September 11 attacks, and ended with a call for war:\n\nAirports scrupulously apply the same laughably ineffective airport harassment to Suzy Chapstick as to Muslim hijackers. It is preposterous to assume every passenger is a potential crazed homicidal maniac. We know who the homicidal maniacs are. They are the ones cheering and dancing right now. We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war.[141]\nThese comments resulted in Coulter being fired as a columnist by National Review, which she subsequently referred to as \"squeamish girly-boys\".[142] Responding to this comment, Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations remarked in the Chicago Sun-Times that before September 11, Coulter \"would have faced swift repudiation from her colleagues\", but \"now it's accepted as legitimate commentary\".[143]\nOne day after the attacks (when death toll estimates were higher than later), Coulter asserted that only Muslims could have been behind them: \"Not all Muslims may be terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims\u2014at least all terrorists capable of assembling a murderous plot against America that leaves 7,000 people dead in under two hours.\"[144]\nCoulter was highly critical in 2002 of the U.S. Department of Transportation and especially its then-secretary Norman Mineta. Her many criticisms include their refusal to use racial profiling as a component of passenger security screening.[145] After a group of Muslims was expelled from a US Airways flight when other passengers expressed concern, sparking a call for Muslims to boycott the airline because of the ejection from a flight of six imams, Coulter wrote, \"If only we could get Muslims to boycott all airlines, we could dispense with airport security altogether.\"[146]\nCoulter also cited the 2002 Senate testimony of FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley, who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors for refusing to authorize a search warrant for 9-11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They knew that he was a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the French Intelligence Service had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that probable cause existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for Osama bin Laden she asserted \"any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe\u2014certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived\u2014has had 'affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,'\" so that she parsed Rowley's position as meaning that \"'probable cause' existed to search Moussaoui's computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England\". Coulter says the poll was \"by The Daily Telegraph\", actually it was by Sunrise, an \"Asian\" (therefore an Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. Because \"FBI headquarters ... refused to engage in racial profiling\", they failed to uncover the 9-11 plot, Coulter asserted. \"The FBI allowed thousands of Americans to be slaughtered on the altar of political correctness. What more do liberals want?\"[147]\nCoulter wrote in another column that she had reviewed the civil rights lawsuits against certain airlines to determine which of them had subjected Arabs to the most \"egregious discrimination\" so that she could fly only that airline. She also said that the airline should be bragging instead of denying any of the charges of discrimination brought against them.[148] In an interview with The Guardian she said, \"I think airlines ought to start advertising: 'We have the most civil rights lawsuits brought against us by Arabs.'\" When the interviewer, Jonathan Freedland, replied by asking what Muslims would do for travel, she responded, \"They could use flying carpets.\"[58]\nIn the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing, Coulter told Hannity host Sean Hannity that the wife of bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev should be jailed for wearing a hijab. Coulter continued by saying \"Assimilating immigrants into our culture isn't really working. They're assimilating us into their culture.\" (Tsarnaev's wife was American-born.)[149]\n\nAnti-semitism accusations\nCoulter was accused of anti-semitism in an October 8, 2007, interview with Donny Deutsch on The Big Idea. During the interview, Coulter stated that the United States is a Christian nation, and said that she wants \"Jews to be perfected, as they say\" (referring to them being converted to Christianity).[150] Deutsch, a practicing Jew, implied that this was an anti-semitic remark, but Coulter said she did not consider it to be a hateful comment.[151][152] Coulter's comments on the show were condemned by the Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee and Bradley Burston,[153] and the National Jewish Democratic Council asked media outlets to cease inviting Coulter as a guest commentator.[154] Talk show host Dennis Prager, while disagreeing with her comments, said that they were not \"anti-semitic\", noting, \"There is nothing in what Ann Coulter said to a Jewish interviewer on CNBC that indicates she hates Jews or wishes them ill, or does damage to the Jewish people or the Jewish state. And if none of those criteria is present, how can someone be labeled anti-Semitic?\"[155][156][157] Conservative activist David Horowitz also defended Coulter against the allegation.[158]\nCoulter in September 2015 tweeted in response to multiple candidates' references to Israel during a Republican presidential primary debate, \"How many f\u2014ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?\"[159] The Anti-Defamation League referred to the tweets as \"ugly, spiteful and anti-Semitic\".[160] In response to accusations of anti-Semitism, she tweeted \"I like the Jews, I like fetuses, I like Reagan. Didn't need to hear applause lines about them all night.\"[159]\n\nPlagiarism accusations\nIn October 2001, Coulter was accused of plagiarism for her 1998 book High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton by Michael Chapman, a columnist for the journal Human Events who claims that passages were taken from a supplement he wrote for the journal in 1997 titled \"A Case for Impeachment\".[142]\nOn the July 5, 2006, episode of Countdown with Keith Olbermann on MSNBC, guest John Barrie, the CEO of iParadigms, offered his professional opinion that Coulter plagiarized in her book Godless as well as in her columns over the previous year.[161] Barrie ran \"Godless\" through iThenticate, his company's machine which is able to scan works and compare them to existing texts.  He found a 25-word section of the text that was \"virtually word-for-word\" matched with a Planned Parenthood pamphlet and a 33-word section almost duplicating a 1999 article from the Portland Press as some examples of evidence.[161]  Barrie also said that it was \"very, very difficult to try to determine whether Ann Coulter was citing that material or whether she was just trying to pass it off\".[161]\nLeft-wing activist group[162] Media Matters for America has appealed to Random House publishing to further investigate Coulter's work.[163] The syndicator of her columns cleared her of the plagiarism charges.[164] Universal Press Syndicate and Crown Books also defended Coulter against the charges.[165]\nColumnist Bill Nemitz from the Portland Press Herald accused Coulter of plagiarizing a very specific sentence from his newspaper in her book Godless, but he also acknowledged that one sentence is insufficient grounds for filing suit.[166]\n\nPublic perception\nCoulter rejects \"the academic convention of euphemism and circumlocution\",[167] and is claimed to play to misogyny in order to further her goals; she \"dominates without threatening (at least not straight men)\".[71] Feminist critics also reject Coulter's opinion that the gains made by women have gone so far as to create an anti-male society[168] and her call for women to be rejected from the military because they are more vicious than men.[169] Like the late anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly, Coulter uses traditionally masculine rhetoric as reasoning for the need for traditional gender roles, and she carries this idea of feminized dependency into her governmental policies, according to feminist critics.[170]\nCoulter was played by Cobie Smulders in Impeachment: American Crime Story; Betty Gilpin was originally cast in the role but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. The series portrays Coulter's actions while assisting the prosecution in Clinton v. Jones.[171]\nCoulter was satirically depicted in season 2, episode 11 of The Boondocks\u2014\"The S Word\"\u2014where she voiced support for a white teacher in the show who said the N-word.\n\nPersonal life\nCoulter has been engaged several times, but she has never married and has no children.[28] She has dated Spin founder and publisher Bob Guccione Jr.[49] and conservative writer Dinesh D'Souza.[172][173] In October 2007, she began dating Andrew Stein, the former president of the New York City Council, a liberal Democrat. On January 7, 2008, however, Stein told the New York Post that the relationship was over, citing irreconcilable differences.[174] Kellyanne Conway, who refers to Coulter as a friend, told New York magazine in 2017 that Coulter \"started dating her security guard probably ten years ago because she couldn't see anybody else\".[175]\nCoulter owns a house, bought in 2005, in Palm Beach, Florida, a condominium in Manhattan, and an apartment in Los Angeles. She votes in Palm Beach and is not registered to do so in New York or California.[176]\n\nBibliography\nCoulter, Ann H. (1998). High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton.

She has written extensively about the history of Communism and the development of civil society in Central and Eastern Europe.\nShe has worked at The Economist and The Spectator,[4] and was a member of the editorial board of The Washington Post (2002\u20132006).[5] Applebaum won the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 2004 for Gulag: A History published the previous year.[6] She is a staff writer for The Atlantic[7] and a senior fellow at The Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.[8]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nApplebaum was born in Washington, D.C.[2] Applebaum has stated that she was brought up in a \"very reform\" Jewish family.[9] Her ancestors came to America from what is now Belarus.[10] She graduated from the Sidwell Friends School in 1982. Applebaum earned a Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, in history and literature from Yale University,[11] where she attended the Soviet history course taught by Wolfgang Leonhard in fall 1982.[12]\nAs a student, Applebaum spent the summer of 1985 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia), which, she has written, helped to shape her opinions.[13] She was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa. As a Marshall Scholar at the London School of Economics, she earned a master's degree in international relations (1987).[14] She studied at St Antony's College, Oxford, before becoming a correspondent for The Economist and moving to Warsaw, Poland, in 1988.[15]\nIn November 1989, Applebaum drove from Warsaw to Berlin to report on the collapse of the Berlin Wall.[16]\n\nCareer[edit]\nAs foreign correspondent for The Economist and The Independent, she covered the fall of the Berlin Wall and the fall of communism. In 1991 she moved back to England to work for The Economist, and was later hired as the foreign and later deputy editor of The Spectator, and later the political editor of the Evening Standard.[17]\nIn 1994, she published her first book Between East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe, a travelogue that described the rise of nationalism across the new states of the former Soviet Union.[18] In 2001, she interviewed prime minister Tony Blair.[19] She also undertook historical research for her book Gulag: A History (2003) on the Soviet prison camp system, which won the 2004\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction.[6][20][21] It was also nominated for a National Book Award, for the Los Angeles Times book award and for the National Book Critics Circle Award.[22]\n\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Applebaum on Gulag, May 25, 2003, C-SPAN Q&A interview with Applebaum on Iron Curtain, December 16, 2012, C-SPAN\nShe has been a member of The Washington Post editorial board.[5] She was a columnist at The Washington Post for seventeen years.[23] Applebaum was an adjunct\u00a0fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.[24]\nHer second history book,\u00a0Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944\u201356, was published in 2012 by Doubleday in the US and Allen Lane in the UK; it was nominated for a National Book Award, shortlisted for the 2013\u00a0PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award.[25]\nFrom 2011 to 2016, she created and ran the Transitions Forum\u00a0at the\u00a0Legatum Institute, an international think tank and educational charity based in London. Among other projects, she ran a two-year program examining the relationship between democracy and growth in Brazil, India and South Africa,[26] created the Future of Syria[27] and Future of Iran projects[28] on future institutional change in those two countries, and commissioned a series of papers on corruption in Georgia,[29] Moldova[30] and Ukraine.[31]\nTogether with Foreign Policy magazine she created Democracy Lab, a website focusing on countries in transition to, or away from, democracy[32] and which has since become Democracy Post[33] at The Washington Post. She also ran Beyond Propaganda,[34] a program examining 21st century propaganda and disinformation. Started in 2014, the program anticipated later debates about \"fake news\". In 2016, she left Legatum because of its stance on Brexit following the appointment of Euroskeptic Philippa Stroud as CEO[35] and joined the London School of Economics as a Professor of Practice at the Institute for Global Affairs. At the LSE, she ran Arena, a program on disinformation and 21st\u00a0century propaganda.[36] In the autumn of 2019 she moved the project to the Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University.[8]\nIn October 2017, she published her third history book, Red Famine: Stalin's War on Ukraine, a history of the Holodomor. The book won the Lionel Gelber Prize[37] and the Duff Cooper Prize[38] for the second time, making her the only author to ever win the award twice.[39]\nIn November 2019, The Atlantic announced that Applebaum was joining the publication as a staff writer starting in January 2020.[23] She was included in the 2020 Prospect list of the top-50 thinkers for the COVID-19 era.[40]\n\nExternal videos Presentation by Applebaum on Twilight of Democracy, July 21, 2020, C-SPAN\nIn July 2020, Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism was published. Partly a memoir and partly political analysis, it was a Der Spiegel[41] and New York Times bestseller.[42]\nAlso in July 2020, Applebaum was one of the 153 signers of the \"Harper's Letter\" (also known as \"A Letter on Justice and Open Debate\") that expressed concern that \"the free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted.\"[43]\nIn November 2022, Applebaum was one of 200 US citizens sanctioned by Russia for \"promotion of the Russophobic campaign and support for the regime in Kyiv.\"[44]\n\nPositions[edit]\nThis section relies excessively on references to primary sources.

In 2000, she described the links between the then-new president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, with the former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov and the former KGB.[45] In 2008, she began speaking about \"Putinism\" as an anti-democratic ideology, though most at the time still considered the Russian president to be a pro-Western pragmatist.[46]\nApplebaum has been a vocal critic of Western conduct regarding the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. In an article in The Washington Post on March 5, 2014, she maintained that the US and its allies should not continue to enable \"the existence of a corrupt Russian regime that is destabilizing Europe\", noting that the actions of President Vladimir Putin had violated \"a series of international treaties\".[47] On March 7, in another article on The Daily Telegraph, discussing an information war, Applebaum argued that \"a robust campaign to tell the truth about Crimea is needed to counter Moscow's lies\".[48] At the end of August, she asked whether Ukraine should prepare for \"total war\" with Russia and whether central Europeans should join them.[49]\nIn 2014, writing in The New York Review of Books she asked (in a review of Karen Dawisha's Putin's Kleptocracy) whether \"the most important story of the past twenty years might not, in fact, have been the failure of democracy, but the rise of a new form of Russian authoritarianism\".[50] She has described the \"myth of Russian humiliation\" and argued that NATO and EU expansion have been a \"phenomenal success\".[51] In July 2016, before the US election, she wrote about connections between Donald Trump and Russia[52] and wrote that Russian support for Trump was part of a wider Russian political campaign designed to destabilize the West.[53] In December 2019, she wrote in The Atlantic that  \"in the 21st century, we must also contend with a new phenomenon: right-wing intellectuals, now deeply critical of their own societies, who have begun paying court to right-wing dictators who dislike America.\"[54]\n\nCentral Europe[edit]\nApplebaum has written about the history of central and eastern Europe, Poland in particular. In the conclusion to her book Iron Curtain, Applebaum argued that the reconstruction of civil society was the most important and most difficult challenge for the post-communist states of central Europe; in another essay, she argued that the modern authoritarian obsession with civil society repression dates back to Vladimir Lenin.[55] She has written essays on the Polish film-maker Andrzej Wajda,[56] on the dual Nazi\u2013Soviet occupation of central Europe,[57] and on why it is inaccurate to define \"Eastern Europe\" as a single entity.[58]\nIn a 2019 article, Applebaum described Poland's then-governing party, Law and Justice (PiS), as xenophobic and nationalist.[59]\n\nDisinformation, propaganda and fake news[edit]\nIn 2014, Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsev launched Beyond Propaganda, a program examining disinformation and propaganda, at the Legatum Institute.[60] Applebaum wrote that a 2014 Russian smear campaign aimed at her when she was writing heavily about the Russian annexation of Crimea. She stated that dubious material posted on the web was eventually recycled by semi-respectable American pro-Russian websites.[61] Applebaum argued in 2015 that Facebook should take responsibility for spreading false stories and help \"undo the terrible damage done by Facebook and other forms of social media to democratic debate and civilized discussion all over the world\".[62]\n\nNationalism[edit]\nIn March 2016, eight months before the election of President Donald Trump, Applebaum wrote a Washington Post column asking, \"Is this the end of the West as we know it?\", which argued that \"we are two or three bad elections away from the end of NATO, the end of the European Union and maybe the end of the liberal world order\".[63] Applebaum endorsed Hillary Clinton's campaign for president in July 2016 on the grounds that Trump is \"a man who appears bent on destroying the alliances that preserve international peace and American power\".[64]\nApplebaum's March 2016 Washington Post column prompted the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger and the German magazine Der Spiegel to interview her. The articles appeared in December 2016[65][66] and January 2017. She argued very early on that the international populist movement which had frequently been identified as \"far right\" or \"alt right\" were in truth not conservative in nature in a way that the term \"conservative\" had long been defined. She wrote that populist groups in Europe share \"ideas and ideology, friends and founders\", and that, unlike Burkean conservatives, they seek to \"overthrow the institutions of the present to bring back things that existed in the past\u2014or that they believe existed in the past\u2014by force.\"[67] Applebaum has underlined the danger of a new \"Nationalist International\", a union of xenophobic, nationalist parties such as Law and Justice in Poland, the Northern League in Italy, and the Freedom Party in Austria.[68]\nIn January 2022, Applebaum was invited to testify before the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing entitled \"Bolstering Democracy in the Age of Rising Authoritarianism\".[69]\n\nAffiliations[edit]\nApplebaum is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[70] She is on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy and Renew Democracy Initiative.[71][72] She was a member of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting's international board of directors.[73] She was a Senior Adjunct Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) where she co-led a major initiative aimed at countering Russian disinformation in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).[74] She was on the editorial board for The American Interest[75] and the Journal of Democracy.[76][when?]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 1992, Applebaum married Rados\u0142aw Sikorski, who later served as Poland's Defence Minister, Foreign Minister, and Marshal of the Sejm. He is a member of the European Parliament. The couple have two sons, Aleksander and Tadeusz.[77] She became a Polish citizen in 2013.[78] She speaks Polish and Russian in addition to English.[79]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\n1992 Charles Douglas-Home Memorial Trust Award\n2003 National Book Award Nonfiction, finalist, Gulag: A History[80]\n2003 Duff Cooper Prize for Gulag: A History\n2004 Pulitzer Prize (General Non-Fiction), Gulag: A History[81]\n2008 Estonian Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana third class\n2008 Lithuanian Millenium Star[82]\n2010 Pet\u0151fi Prize\n2012 Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland[83]\n2012 National Book Award (Nonfiction), finalist, Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944\u20131956[84]\n2013 Cundill Prize, Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944\u20131956[85]\n2013 Duke of Westminster's Medal for Military Literature, Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944\u20131956[86]\n2017 Doctor of Humane Letters Honoris Causa, Georgetown University[87]\n2017 Honorary Doctorate, National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy[88]\n2017 Duff Cooper Prize for her book Red Famine: Stalin's War on Ukraine\n2017 Antonovych Prize[89]\n2018 Lionel Gelber Prize for her book Red Famine: Stalin's War on Ukraine[90]\n2018 Honorary Fritz Stern Professor, University of Wroc\u0142aw[91]\n2019 Premio Nonino \"Maestro del nostro tempo\" (\"Master of our Time\")[92]\n2019 Order of Princess Olga, third class[93]\n2021 National Magazine Awards finalist in categories \"Essays and Criticism\" and \"Columns and Commentary\"[94]\n2021 Premio Internacional de Periodismo de EL MUNDO[95]\n2022 Order of Princess Olga, second class[96]\nLectures and podcasts[edit]\n2008 American Academy in Berlin lecture: Putinism, the Ideology[97]\n2012\u20132013 Applebaum held the Phillip Roman chair at the London School of Economics and gave four major lectures on the history and contemporary politics of eastern Europe and Russia[98]\n2015 Munk debates[99]\n2016 Intelligence Squared[100]\n2017 Sam Harris: The Russian Connection,[101] The Path to Impeachment[102]\nJay Nordlinger: Putin and the Present Danger[103]\n2017 Georgetown School of Foreign Service Commencement Speech[104]\n2012 \u2013 2022 (six separate interviews): Fresh Air[105]\nBibliography[edit]\nBooks[edit]\nBetween East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe, Pantheon, 1994, reprinted by Random House, 1995; Penguin, 2015; and Anchor, 2017, ISBN\u00a00679421505\nGulag: A History, Doubleday, 2003, 677 pages, ISBN\u00a00-7679-0056-1; paperback, Bantam Dell, 2004, 736 pages, ISBN\u00a01-4000-3409-4\nIron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944\u20131956, Allen Lane, 2012, 614 pages, ISBN\u00a0978-0-713-99868-9 / Doubleday ISBN\u00a0978-0-385-51569-6\nGulag Voices\u00a0: An Anthology, Yale University Press, 2011, 224 pages, ISBN\u00a09780300177831; hardback\nFrom a Polish Country House Kitchen, Chronicle Books, 2012, 288 pages, ISBN\u00a01-452-11055-7; hardback\nRed Famine: Stalin's War on Ukraine, Penguin Randomhouse, 2017[106][107]\nTwilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism, Doubleday, 2020, 224 pages, ISBN\u00a0978-0385545808; hardback\nWyb\u00f3r (Choice), Agora, 2021, 320 pages, ISBN\u00a0978-8326838255; hardback\nSelected articles[edit]\n\u2014 (November 6, 2017). \"100 years later, Bolshevism is back.

He previously served as deputy national security advisor from 2013 to 2015 and deputy secretary of state from 2015 to 2017 under President Barack Obama.[1] Blinken was previously national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden from 2009 to 2013.\nDuring the Clinton administration, Blinken served in the State Department and in senior positions on the National Security Council from 1994 to 2001. He was a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies from 2001 to 2002. He advocated for the 2003 invasion of Iraq while serving as the Democratic staff director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 2002 to 2008.[2] He was a foreign policy advisor for Joe Biden's 2008 presidential campaign, before advising the Obama\u2013Biden presidential transition.\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Blinken served as deputy assistant to the president and national security advisor to the vice president. During his tenure in the Obama administration, he helped craft U.S. policy on Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the nuclear program of Iran.[3][4] After leaving government service, Blinken moved into the private sector, co-founding WestExec Advisors, a consulting firm. Blinken returned to government first as a foreign policy advisor for Biden's 2020 presidential campaign, then as Biden's pick for secretary of state, a position the Senate confirmed him for on January 26, 2021.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nBlinken was born on April 16, 1962, in Yonkers, New York, to Jewish parents. His mother was Judith (n\u00e9e Frehm) Blinken and his father was Donald M. Blinken, who later served as the U.S. ambassador to Hungary.[5][6][7] His maternal grandparents were Hungarian Jews.[8] Blinken's uncle, Alan Blinken, served as the U.S. ambassador to Belgium.[9][10] His paternal grandfather, Maurice Henry Blinken, was an early backer of Israel who studied its economic viability,[11] and his great-grandfather was Meir Blinken, a Yiddish writer.[12]\nBlinken attended the Dalton School in New York City until 1971.[6] He then moved to Paris with his mother and Samuel Pisar; his mother married Pisar after divorcing Donald Blinken. In his confirmation hearing, Blinken recalled the story of his stepfather, Pisar, who had been the only Holocaust survivor of the 900 children in his school in Poland. Pisar found refuge in a U.S. tank after making a break into the forest during a Nazi death march.[13][14] In Paris, Blinken attended \u00c9cole Jeannine Manuel.[15]\nFrom 1980 to 1984, Blinken attended Harvard University, where he majored in social studies. He co-edited Harvard's daily student newspaper, The Harvard Crimson,[5][16][17] and wrote a number of articles on current affairs.[18][19] After graduating from the university, Blinken worked as an intern for The New Republic for about a year.[6][19] He earned a J.D. from Columbia Law School in 1988[20][21] and practiced law in New York City and Paris.[22] Blinken worked with his father to raise funds for Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in the 1988 United States presidential election.[5]\nIn his monograph Ally versus Ally: America, Europe, and the Siberian Pipeline Crisis (1987), Blinken argued that exerting diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union during the Siberian pipeline crisis was less significant for American interests than maintaining strong relations between the United States and Europe.[23] Ally versus Ally was based on Blinken's undergraduate thesis in which he interviewed Henry Kissinger.[16][24]\n\nEarly career\nClinton and Bush administrations\nBlinken has held senior foreign policy positions in two administrations over two decades.[5] He was a member of the National Security Council (NSC) staff from 1994 to 2001.[25] From 1994 to 1998, Blinken was special assistant to the president and senior director for strategic planning and NSC senior director for speechwriting.[26] From 1999 to 2001, he was special assistant to the president and senior director for European and Canadian affairs.[27]\nBlinken supported the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[2][28] In 2002, he was appointed staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a position he served in until 2008.[25] Blinken assisted then-Senator Joe Biden, Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in formulating Biden's support for the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with Blinken characterizing the vote to invade Iraq as \"a vote for tough diplomacy\".[29]\nIn the years following the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq, Blinken assisted Biden in formulating a proposal in the Senate to establish in Iraq three independent regions divided along ethnic or sectarian lines: a \"Shiastan\" in the south, a \"Sunnistan\" in the north, as well as Iraqi Kurdistan. The proposal was overwhelmingly rejected at home, as well as in Iraq, where the prime minister opposed the partition plan.[30]\nHe was also a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In 2008, Blinken worked for Joe Biden's presidential campaign,[5] and was a member of the Obama\u2013Biden presidential transition team.[31]\n\nObama administration\nBlinken in the White House Situation Room (back of the room, blue shirt, leaning) during the Osama Bin Laden raid, as seen in the photograph named Situation Room\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Blinken was Deputy Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor to the Vice President. In this position he helped craft U.S. policy on Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the nuclear program of Iran.[3][4] Blinken was sworn in as deputy national security advisor, succeeding Denis McDonough, on January 20, 2013.[32]\nOn November 7, 2014, President Obama announced that he would nominate Blinken for the Deputy Secretary post, replacing the retiring William J. Burns.[33] On December 16, 2014, Blinken was confirmed as Deputy Secretary of State by the Senate by a vote of 55 to 38.[34]\nOf Obama's 2011 decision to kill Osama bin Laden, Blinken said \"I've never seen a more courageous decision made by a leader.\"[35] A 2013 profile described him as \"one of the government's key players in drafting Syria policy\",[5] for which he served as a public face.[36] Blinken was influential in formulating the Obama administration's response to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.[37][38]\nBlinken supported the 2011 military intervention in Libya[36] and the supply of weapons to Syrian rebels.[39] He condemned the 2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt and expressed support for the democratically elected Turkish government and its institutions, but also criticized the 2016\u2013present purges in Turkey.[40] In April 2015, Blinken voiced support for the Saudi Arabian\u2013led intervention in Yemen.[41] He said that \"as part of that effort, we have expedited weapons deliveries, we have increased our intelligence sharing, and we have established a joint coordination planning cell in the Saudi operation centre.\"[42]\nBlinken worked with Biden on requests for American money to replenish Israel's arsenal of Iron Dome interceptor missiles during the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[43] In May 2015, Blinken criticized the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar and warned Myanmar's leaders about the dangers of anti-Muslim legislation,[44] saying that Rohingya Muslims \"should have a path to citizenship. The uncertainty that comes from not having any status is one of the things that may drive people to leave.\"[45]\nIn June 2015, Blinken claimed that more than ten thousand ISIL fighters had been killed by American-led airstrikes against the Islamic State since a U.S.-led coalition launched a campaign against it nine months previously.[46]\n\n\nPenn Biden Center\nFrom 2017 to 2019, Blinken served as the managing director of the Penn Biden Center, a University of Pennsylvania think tank based in Washington.[47] During this time he published several articles on foreign policy and the Trump administration.\n\nSecretary of state\nNomination and confirmation\nBlinken being sworn in as Secretary of State at the U.S. State Department on January 26, 2021.\nBlinken was a foreign policy advisor for Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.[48]\nOn November 22, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that Biden had selected Blinken as his nominee for secretary of state.[49] These reports were later corroborated by The New York Times and other outlets.[30][50][49] On November 24, upon being announced as Biden's choice for secretary of state, Blinken said, \"We can't solve all the world's problems alone [and] we need to be working with other countries.\"[51] He had earlier remarked in a September 2020 interview with the Associated Press that \"democracy is in retreat around the world, and unfortunately it's also in retreat at home because of the president taking a two-by-four to its institutions, its values and its people every day.\"[52]\nBlinken's confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 19, 2021. His nomination was confirmed by the committee on January 25 with a vote of 15\u20133.[53] On January 26, Blinken was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 78\u201322.[1] Blinken took the oath of office of the secretary of state later that day.[54] In doing so, he became the third former deputy secretary of state to serve as the Secretary of State, after Lawrence Eagleburger and Warren Christopher in 1992 and 1993, respectively.[55][56]\n\nTenure\nSee also: List of international trips made by Antony Blinken as United States Secretary of State\nMyanmar\nOn January 31, 2021, Blinken condemned the 2021 Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat and expressed grave concerns on the detention of government officials and civil society leaders, calling for their immediate release.[57] He stated that, \"the United States will continue to take firm action against those who perpetrate violence against the people of Burma as they demand the restoration of their democratically elected government.\"[58]\n\nAfghanistan\nIn February 2021, having spoken to president Ashraf Ghani, Blinken voiced support for Afghan peace negotiations with Taliban Islamist rebels and reiterated the United States' commitment to a peace deal that includes a \"just and durable political settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.\"[59]\n\nBlinken meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to discuss U.S. troop withdrawal\nBlinken made an unannounced visit to Kabul on April 15 and met with U.S. military and diplomatic personnel following the Biden administration's announcement of the 2021 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.[60] He said the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was made to focus resources on China and the COVID-19 pandemic.[61] He faced calls to resign as secretary of state following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.[62][63][64][65]\nIn August 2021, Blinken rejected comparisons between the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan due to the Taliban offensive, which started in May 2021 after U.S. and coalition military forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan, and the chaotic American departure from Saigon in 1975, saying that \"We went to Afghanistan 20 years ago with one mission, and that mission was to deal with the folks who attacked us on 9/11 and we have succeeded in that mission.\"[66]\n\nAfrica\nBlinken meeting with Kenyan President William Ruto on September 21, 2022\nIn February 2021, Blinken condemned ethnic cleansing in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia and called for the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean forces and other fighters.[67][68]\nIn the midst of the Biden administration's continuing review of the normalization agreement between Morocco and Israel enacted during the previous administration, Blinken maintained that the recognition of Morocco's sovereignty over the disputed territory of Western Sahara, which was annexed by Morocco in 1975, will not be reversed imminently. During internal discussions, he supported improving relations between the two countries and expressed urgency in appointing a United Nations envoy to Western Sahara.[69][70]\nIn March 2023, he met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Addis Ababa to normalize relations between the United States and Ethiopia that were strained by the Tigray War between the Ethiopian government and Tigray rebels.[71]\n\nSouth America\nBlinken spoke with the interim president of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\u00f3, whom the Biden administration will continue to recognize as the country's head of state and not Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.[72]\n\nAsia\nBlinken with Philippine President Bongbong Marcos in Manila on August 6, 2022\nBlinken made his first international trip with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to Tokyo and Seoul on March 15, during which he warned China against coercion and aggression.[73][74] He also condemned the Chinese government for committing genocide against ethnic Uyghurs.[75]\nIn July 2021, the Biden administration accused China of a global cyberespionage campaign, which Blinken said posed \"a major threat to our economic and national security\".[76]\nIn late April 2021, Blinken denounced the sentencing of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists Jimmy Lai, Albert Ho, and Lee Cheuk-yan among others, for their roles in the 2019 Hong Kong protests, calling it a \"politically-motivated\" decision.[77][78]\nIn May 2022, Blinken stated that \"China is the one country that has the intention as well as the economic, technological, military and diplomatic means to advance a different vision of international order.\"[79] He dismissed China's claims to be neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian War and accused China of supporting Russia.[80]\nIn June 2023, Blinken met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his trip to Beijing. According to the State Department's readout, Blinken \"emphasized the importance of maintaining open channels of communication across the full range of issues to reduce the risk of miscalculation\" and \"made clear that while we will compete vigorously, the United States will responsibly manage that competition so that the relationship does not veer into conflict.\"[81]\n\nG7 meeting\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken meets with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Bali, Indonesia, on July 9, 2022\nIn May 2021, Blinken traveled to London and Reykjav\u00edk for the G7 Foreign and Development Ministers' meeting and the Arctic Council Ministerial meeting respectively.[82][83] In a meeting with president Volodymyr Zelensky and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Kyiv, Blinken reaffirmed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity against \"Russian aggression\".[84] During the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Blinken expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself but warned that evicting Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem is among the actions that could further escalate outbreaks of violence and retaliation.[85][86] He, along with the United Nations Security Council, called for full adherence to the truce and stressed the immediate need for humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians while reiterating the need for a two-state solution.[87] Following the ceasefire and coinciding Blinken's visit to Jerusalem on May 25, the transfer of food and medical supplies furnished by the United Nations and Physicians for Human Rights, aid workers, and journalists were permitted into the Gaza Strip.[88]\n\nEurope\nBlinken in group meeting with German FM Maas, Turkish FM \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, British FM Raab, Italian FM Di Maio, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg and U.S. Secretary of Defense Austin, April 2021\nThe decision to waive sanctions against Nord Stream AG and its chief executive Matthias Warnig, subsequent to the completion of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, drew congressional criticisms.[89] Blinken defended the action as pragmatic and practical to U.S. interests and remarked that proceeding otherwise would be counterproductive with European relations.[89] In June 2021, Blinken traveled with Biden to attend the 47th G7 summit in Cornwall, the 31st NATO summit in Brussels, and the summit meeting with president Vladimir Putin in Geneva.[90] Blinken and Biden both acknowledged that relations between the U.S. and Russia were at their lowest point, and a more predictable relationship remained a key priority.[91] However, he signaled that further punitive actions would be enforced if the Russian government chose to continue with hostile activities such as interference in the 2020 presidential elections, the SolarWinds cyberattack, or the apparent poisoning and imprisonment of Alexei Navalny.[91] Of the administration's decision to forgo a joint press conference after the summit, Blinken explained that it was \"the most effective way\" and \"not a rare practice\".[92]\nLater that month, Blinken traveled to Brussels for a NATO Ministerial with European Union counterparts to underscore the Biden administration's determination to strengthen transatlantic alliances.\nBlinken has been a co-chair of the Trade and Technology Council since its creation in 2021 to encourage trade relations with the European Union.[93]\n\nRussia-Ukraine war\nBlinken meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv in 2022. As Secretary of State, Blinken has been deeply involved in the American response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIn January 2022, Blinken authorized the supply of weapons to Ukraine to support the Eastern European country in amid border tensions with Russia.[94][95] At a joint press availability with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on January 19, Blinken said \"One of the principles which you've heard us repeat \u2013 but it always bears repeating \u2013 is nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.[96] Blinken publicly warned on February 11 of the likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine prior to the end the 2022 Winter Olympics[97] and on February 13, he said the risk was \"high enough and the threat is imminent enough\" that the evacuation of most staff from the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv was \"the prudent thing to do\".[98] In September 2022, Blinken pledged that the United States would help the Ukrainian military retake Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.[99] He criticized Vladimir Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons, saying that \"Russia has gotten itself into the mess that it's in is because there is no one in the [autocratic] system to effectively tell Putin he's doing the wrong thing.\"[100]\nRegarding the countries that decided to be neutral in the war between Russia and Ukraine, Blinken said that \"It's pretty hard to be neutral when it comes to this aggression. There is a clear aggressor. There is a clear victim.\"[101]\nSpeaking about the 2022 Russian mobilization, he said that mobilized Russian civilians were being treated as \"cannon fodder that Putin is trying to throw into the war.\"[102] On October 21, 2022, Blinken said the United States saw no willingness on the side of Russia to end its war in Ukraine by diplomatic means, despite American attempts.[103] Blinken questioned China's peace proposal, saying \"the world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia, supported by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its own terms.\"[104] In June 2023, he rejected any \"cease-fire that simply freezes current lines in place\".[105] In July 2023, he defended Biden's decision to supply Ukraine with cluster munitions.[106]\n\nAmericans detained abroad\nBlinken and the Biden administration have been criticized for the handling of Americans who are wrongfully imprisoned abroad. Families of U.S. detainees in the Middle East were upset that they were left off of a call with Secretary Blinken.[107] In July 2022, Blinken had a meeting with Sergey Lavrov to discuss a prisoner swap to secure the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.[108] Blinken has met with the Bring Our Families Home campaign, a coalition of families with loved ones detained abroad.[109]\nBlinken, along with the work of Special Presidential Envoy of Hostage Affairs Roger D. Carstens, has negotiated the release of over a dozen Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad including Trevor Reed, Danny Fenster, Baquer Namazi, the entire Citgo Six, Osman Khan, Matthew John Heath, Mark Frerichs, and Jorge Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\nForeign policy positions\nSee also: Foreign policy of the Joe Biden administration\nBlinken with Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi, January 18, 2016\nAs foreign policy advisor to then 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, The New York Times described Blinken as \"ha[ving] Biden's ear on policy issues\".[110] His foreign policy positions have been described as hawkish.[111] Blinken has asserted that \"[Biden] would not tie military assistance to Israel to things like annexation or other decisions by the Israeli government with which we might disagree\".[112] Blinken praised the Trump administration-brokered normalization agreements between Israel and Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.[113][114] On October 28, 2020, Blinken reaffirmed that a Biden administration will undertake strategic review of the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, ensuring that it advances U.S interests and values.[115] In January 2021, Blinken has stated the Biden administration would keep the American embassy to Israel in Jerusalem and would seek a two-state solution to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.[116]\nBlinken is in favor of continuing non-nuclear sanctions against Iran and described it as \"a strong hedge against Iranian misbehavior in other areas\".[113] He criticized former president Trump's withdrawal of the U.S. from the international nuclear agreement with Iran and expressed support for a \"longer and stronger\" nuclear deal.[117][118] Blinken did not rule out a military intervention to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.[119][120]\nBlinken has been critical of the Trump administration in aiding China to advance its own key strategic goals. He stated: \"[Trump] weaken[ed] American alliances, leaving a vacuum in the world for China to fill, abandoning our values and giving China a green light to trample on human rights and democracy from Xinjiang to Hong Kong\".[121] However, he also credited the former president's administration for its aggressive approach and has characterized China as a \"techno-autocracy\" which seeks world dominance.[122][123] He indicated a desire to welcome political refugees from Hong Kong and stated that the Biden administration's commitment to Taiwan's defense would \"absolutely endure\", and that China's use of military force against Taiwan \"would be a grievous mistake on their part\".[123] Blinken has also viewed China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in its northwestern region of Xinjiang.[124] Blinken has characterized former president Trump's Phase One trade deal with China as \"a debacle\".[125] He said it was unrealistic to \"fully decouple\" from China and has expressed support for \"stronger economic ties with Taiwan\".[125][126]\n\nBlinken with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, June 7, 2023\nBlinken has indicated American interest in robust ties between itself, Greece, Israel, and Cyprus regarding the Eastern Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act and acknowledged the threats posed by an expansionist Turkey, which is \"not acting like an ally\".[127] He opposed Turkish president Recep Erdogan's call for \"a two-state solution in Cyprus\", saying the Biden administration is committed to the reunification of Cyprus.[40][128] Blinken has also suggested that he would consider sanctioning the Erdogan administration.[129] Blinken reaffirmed his support of keeping NATO's door open for Georgia, a country in the Caucasus, and raised the argument that NATO member countries have been more effectively shielded from \"Russian aggression\".[130]\nBlinken expressed his support of extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia to limit the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads.[30][131] Blinken said the Biden administration will \"review\" security assistance to Azerbaijan due to the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and voiced his support for \"the provision to Armenia of security assistance\".[132]\n\nBlinken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Israel, January 9, 2024\nBlinken opposed the United Kingdom's separation from the European Union and referred to it as a \"total mess\" with consequences adverse to U.S. interest.[133][134] Blinken expressed concern over perceived human rights violations in Egypt under the presidency of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.[135] He condemned the arrest of three employees for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights organization, saying that \"meeting with foreign diplomats is not a crime. Nor is peacefully advocating for human rights.\"[136] Referring to the re-instated Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, declared by the Taliban following their 2021 capture of Kabul, Blinken has stated that the United States will not recognize any government that harbors terrorist groups or that does not uphold basic human rights.[137]\nDuring a visit to Tel Aviv following the Hamas attack on Israel, Blinken promised to help defend Israel \"as long as America exists.\" Blinken said that \"Israel has the right, indeed the obligation, to defend itself and to ensure that this never happens again.\"[138] He rejected calls for a ceasefire in the Israel\u2013Hamas war but said he supported \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to the people of the Gaza Strip.[139]\n\nPersonal life\nBlinken performs during the Global Music Diplomacy Initiative launch, playing left-handed on a Fender Stratocaster.\nBlinken is Jewish.[140] In 2002, Blinken and Evan Ryan were married in an interfaith ceremony officiated by a rabbi and a priest at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Washington, D.C.[20][5] They have two children.[141] Blinken is fluent in French.[142] He plays the guitar and has three songs available on Spotify by the alias Ablinken[143] (pronounced \"Abe Lincoln\").[144] Blinken gave a cover performance of \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" by Muddy Waters in September 2023 to launch the Global Music Diplomacy Initiative at the State Department, the video of which went viral.[145][146][147][148]\n\nPrivate sector\nWestExec Advisors\nIn 2017, Blinken co-founded WestExec Advisors, a political strategy advising firm, with Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, Sergio Aguirre, and Nitin Chadda.[149][150] WestExec's clients have included Google's Jigsaw, Israeli artificial-intelligence company Windward, surveillance drone manufacturer Shield AI, which signed a $7.2\u00a0million contract with the Air Force,[151] and \"Fortune 100 types\".[152] According to Foreign Policy, the firm's clientele includes \"the defense industry, private equity firms, and hedge funds\".[153] Blinken received almost $1.2\u00a0million in compensation from WestExec.[154]\nIn an interview with The Intercept, Flournoy described WestExec's role as facilitating relationships between Silicon Valley firms and the Department of Defense and law enforcement;[155] Flournoy and others compared WestExec to Kissinger Associates.[155][156]\n\nPine Island Capital Partners\nBlinken, as well as other Biden transition team members Michele Flournoy, former Pentagon advisor, and Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense, are partners of private equity firm Pine Island Capital Partners,[157][158] a strategic partner of WestExec.[159] Pine Island's chairman is John Thain, the final chairman of Merrill Lynch before its sale to Bank of America.[160] Blinken went on leave from Pine Island in August 2020 to join the Biden campaign as a senior foreign policy advisor.[158] He said he would divest himself of his equity stake in Pine Island if confirmed for a position in the Biden administration.[159]\nDuring the final stretch of Biden's presidential campaign, Pine Island raised $218\u00a0million for a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a public offering to invest in \"defense, government service and aerospace industries\" and COVID-19 relief, which the firm's prospectus (initially filed with the U.S. SEC in September and finalized on November 13, 2020) predicted would be profitable as the government looked to private contractors to address the pandemic.[158] Thain said he chose the other partners because of their \"access, network and expertise\".[151]\nIn a December 2020 New York Times article raising questions about potential conflicts of interest between WestExec principals, Pine Island advisors, including Blinken, and service in the Biden administration, critics called for full disclosure of all WestExec/Pine Island financial relationships, divestiture of ownership stakes in companies bidding on government contracts or enjoying existing contracts, and assurances that Blinken and others recuse themselves from decisions that might advantage their previous clients.[151]\nBlinken is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations[161] and was previously a global affairs analyst for CNN.[162][163]\n\nPublications\nBlinken, Antony J.
