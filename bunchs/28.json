A member of the Democratic Party, Albright was the first woman to hold that post.[4]\nBorn in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Albright immigrated to the United States after the 1948 communist coup d'\u00e9tat when she was eleven years old. Her father, diplomat Josef Korbel, settled the family in Denver, Colorado, and she became a U.S. citizen in 1957.[5][6] Albright graduated from Wellesley College in 1959 and earned a PhD from Columbia University in 1975, writing her thesis on the Prague Spring.[7] She worked as an aide to Senator Edmund Muskie from 1976 to 1978, before serving as a staff member on the National Security Council under Zbigniew Brzezinski. She served in that position until 1981 when President Jimmy Carter left office.[8]\nAfter leaving the National Security Council, Albright joined the academic faculty of Georgetown University in 1982 and advised Democratic candidates regarding foreign policy. Following the 1992 presidential election, Albright helped assemble President Bill Clinton's National Security Council. She was appointed United States ambassador to the United Nations from 1993 to 1997, a position she held until her elevation as secretary of state. Secretary Albright served in that capacity until President Clinton left office in 2001.\nAlbright served as chair of the Albright Stonebridge Group, a consulting firm, and was the Michael and Virginia Mortara Endowed Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.[9] She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in May 2012.[10] Albright served on the board of the Council on Foreign Relations.[11]\n\n\nEarly life and career[edit]\nAlbright was born Marie Jana K\u00f6rbelov\u00e1 in 1937 in the Sm\u00edchov district of Prague, Czechoslovakia.[12] Her parents were Josef K\u00f6rbel, a Czech diplomat, and Anna K\u00f6rbel (n\u00e9e Spieglov\u00e1).[13] At the time of Albright's birth, Czechoslovakia had been independent for less than 20 years, having gained independence from Austria-Hungary after World War I. Her father was a supporter of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk and Edvard Bene\u0161.[14] Marie Jana had a younger sister Katherine[15] and a younger brother John (these versions of their names are Anglicized).[16]\nWhen Marie Jana was born, her father was serving as a press-attach\u00e9 at the Czechoslovak Embassy in Belgrade. The signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938\u2014and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia by Adolf Hitler's troops\u2014forced the family into exile because of their links with Bene\u0161.[17]\nJosef and Anna converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1941.[13] Marie Jana and her siblings were raised in the Roman Catholic faith.[18][19] In 1997, Albright said her parents never told her or her two siblings about their Jewish ancestry and heritage.[18]\nThe family moved to Britain in May 1939. Here her father worked for Bene\u0161's Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Her family first lived on Kensington Park Road in Notting Hill, London\u2014where they lived throughout the Blitz\u2014but later moved to Beaconsfield, then Walton-on-Thames, on the outskirts of London.[20] They kept a large metal table in the house, which was intended to shelter the family from the recurring threat of German air raids.[21] While in England, Marie Jana was one of the children shown in a documentary film designed to promote sympathy for war refugees in London.[22]\nAfter the defeat of the Nazis in the European theatre of World War II and the collapse of Nazi Germany and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the Korbel family returned to Prague.[18] Korbel was appointed as press attach\u00e9 at the Czechoslovakian Embassy in Yugoslavia, and the family moved to Belgrade\u2014then part of Yugoslavia\u2014which was governed by the Communist Party. Korbel was concerned his daughter would be exposed to Marxism in a Yugoslav school, and so she was taught privately by a governess before being sent to the Prealpina Institut pour Jeunes Filles finishing school in Chexbres, on Lake Geneva in Switzerland.[23] She learned to speak French while in Switzerland and changed her name from Marie Jana to Madeleine.[24]\nThe Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took over the government in 1948, with support from the Soviet Union. As an opponent of communism, Korbel was forced to resign from his position.[25] He later obtained a position on a United Nations delegation to Kashmir. He sent his family to the United States, by way of London, to wait for him when he arrived to deliver his report to the UN Headquarters, then located in Lake Success, New York.[25]\n\nYouth and young adulthood in the United States[edit]\nKorbel's family emigrated from the United Kingdom on the SS America, departing Southampton on November 5, 1948, and arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor on November 11, 1948.[26][27] The family initially settled in Great Neck on the North Shore of Long Island.[28] Korbel applied for political asylum, arguing that as an opponent of Communism, he was under threat in Prague.[29] Korbel stated \"I cannot, of course, return to the Communist Czechoslovakia as I would be arrested for my faithful adherence to the ideals of democracy. I would be most obliged to you if you could kindly convey to his Excellency the Secretary of State that I beg of him to be granted the right to stay in the United States, the same right to be given to my wife and three children.\"[30]\nWith the help of Philip Moseley, a Russian language professor at Columbia University in New York City, Korbel obtained a position on the staff of the political science department at the University of Denver in Colorado.[31] He became dean of the university's school of international relations, and later taught future U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The school was named the Josef Korbel School of International Studies in 2008 in his honor.[14]\nMadeleine Korbel spent her teen years in Denver and in 1955 graduated from the Kent Denver School in Cherry Hills Village, a suburb of Denver. She founded the school's international relations club and was its first president.[32] She attended Wellesley College, in Wellesley, Massachusetts, on a full scholarship, majoring in political science, and graduated in 1959.[33] The topic of her senior thesis was Zden\u011bk Fierlinger, a former Czechoslovakian prime minister.[34] She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1957, and joined the College Democrats of America.[35]\nWhile home in Denver from Wellesley, Korbel worked as an intern for The Denver Post. There she met Joseph Albright. He was the nephew of Alicia Patterson, owner of Newsday and wife of philanthropist Harry Frank Guggenheim.[36] Korbel converted to the Episcopal Church at the time of her marriage.[18][19] The couple were married in Wellesley in 1959, shortly after her graduation.[33] They lived in Rolla, Missouri, while Joseph completed his military service at nearby Fort Leonard Wood. During this time, Albright worked at The Rolla Daily News.[37]\nThe couple moved to Joseph's hometown of Chicago, Illinois, in January 1960. Joseph worked at the Chicago Sun-Times as a journalist, and Albright worked as a picture editor for Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.[38] The following year, Joseph Albright began work at Newsday in New York City, and the couple moved to Garden City on Long Island.[39] That year, she gave birth to twin daughters, Alice Patterson Albright and Anne Korbel Albright. The twins were born six weeks premature and required a long hospital stay. As a distraction, Albright began Russian language classes at Hofstra University in the Village of Hempstead nearby.[39]\nIn 1962, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where they lived in Georgetown. Albright studied international relations and continued in Russian at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, a division of Johns Hopkins University in the capital.[40]\nJoseph's aunt Alicia Patterson died in 1963, and the Albrights returned to Long Island with the notion of Joseph taking over the family newspaper business.[41] Albright gave birth to another daughter, Katharine Medill Albright, in 1967. She continued her studies at Columbia University's Department of Public Law and Government.[42] (It was later renamed as the political science department, and is located within the School of International and Public Affairs.) She earned a certificate in Russian from the Russian Institute (now Harriman Institute),[43][44] an M.A. and a PhD, writing her master's thesis on the Soviet diplomatic corps and her doctoral dissertation on the role of journalists in the Prague Spring of 1968.[45] She also took a graduate course given by Zbigniew Brzezinski, who later became her boss at the U.S. National Security Council.[46]\n\nCareer[edit]\nEarly career[edit]\nAlbright returned to Washington, D.C., in 1968, and commuted to Columbia for her doctor of philosophy, which she earned in 1975.[47] She began fund-raising for her daughters' school, involvement which led to several positions on education boards.[48] She was eventually invited to organize a fund-raising dinner for the 1972 presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Ed Muskie of Maine.[49] This association with Muskie led to a position as his chief legislative assistant in 1976.[50] However, after the 1976 U.S. presidential election of Jimmy Carter, Albright's former professor Brzezinski was named National Security Advisor, and recruited Albright from Muskie in 1978 to work in the West Wing as the National Security Council's congressional liaison.[50] Following Carter's loss in 1980 to Ronald Reagan, Albright moved on to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where she was given a grant for a research project.[51] She chose to write on the dissident journalists involved in Poland's Solidarity movement, then in its infancy but gaining international attention.[51] She traveled to Poland for her research, interviewing dissidents in Gda\u0144sk, Warsaw, and Krak\u00f3w.[52] Upon her return to Washington, her husband announced his intention to divorce her so that he could pursue a relationship with another woman; the divorce was finalized in 1983.[53]\nAlbright joined the academic staff at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1982, specializing in Eastern European studies.[54] She also directed the university's program on women in global politics.[55] She served as a major Democratic Party foreign policy advisor, briefing vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 (both campaigns ended in defeat).[56] In 1992, Bill Clinton returned the White House to the Democratic Party, and Albright was employed to handle the transition to a new administration at the National Security Council.[57] In January 1993, Clinton nominated her to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, her first diplomatic posting.[58]\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations[edit]\nAlbright was appointed ambassador to the United Nations, a Cabinet-level position, shortly after Clinton was inaugurated, presenting her credentials on February 9, 1993. During her tenure at the U.N., she had a rocky relationship with the U.N. secretary-general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom she criticized as \"disengaged\" and \"neglect[ful]\" of genocide in Rwanda.[59] Albright wrote: \"My deepest regret from my years in public service is the failure of the United States and the international community to act sooner to halt these crimes.\"[60]\nIn Shake Hands with the Devil, Rom\u00e9o Dallaire writes that in 1994, in Albright's role as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N., she avoided describing the killings in Rwanda as \"genocide\" until overwhelmed by the evidence for it;[61] this is now how she described these massacres in her memoirs.[62] She was instructed to support a reduction or withdrawal (something which never happened) of the U.N. Assistance Mission for Rwanda but was later given more flexibility.[62] Albright later remarked in PBS documentary Ghosts of Rwanda that \"it was a very, very difficult time, and the situation was unclear. You know, in retrospect, it all looks very clear. But when you were [there] at the time, it was unclear about what was happening in Rwanda.\"[63]\nAlso in 1996, after Cuban military pilots shot down two small civilian aircraft flown by the Cuban-American exile group Brothers to the Rescue over international waters, she announced at a UN Security Council meeting debating a resolution condemning Cuba: \"This is not cojones. This is cowardice.\"[64] The line endeared her to President Clinton, who said it was \"probably the most effective one-liner in the whole administration's foreign policy\".[64] When Albright appeared at a memorial service for the deceased in Miami on March 2, 1996, she was greeted with chants of \"libertad\".[65][66]\nIn 1996, Albright entered into a secret pact with Richard Clarke, Michael Sheehan, and James Rubin to overthrow U.N. secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who was running unopposed for a second term in the 1996 selection. After 15 U.S. peacekeepers died in a failed raid in Somalia in 1993, Boutros-Ghali became a political scapegoat in the United States.[67] They dubbed the pact \"Operation Orient Express\" to reflect their hope that other nations would join the United States.[68] Although every other member of the United Nations Security Council voted for Boutros-Ghali, the United States refused to yield to international pressure to drop its lone veto. After four deadlocked meetings of the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali suspended his candidacy and became the only U.N. secretary-general ever to be denied a second term. The United States then fought a four-round veto duel with France, forcing it to back down and accept Kofi Annan as the next secretary-general. In his memoirs, Clarke said that \"the entire operation had strengthened Albright's hand in the competition to be Secretary of State in the second Clinton administration\".[68]\n\nSecretary of State[edit]\nMain articles: Foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration and List of international trips made by Madeleine Albright as United States Secretary of State\nWhen Clinton began his second term in January 1997, following his re-election, he required a new Secretary of State, as incumbent Warren Christopher was retiring.[69] The top level of the Clinton administration was divided into two camps on selecting the new foreign policy. Outgoing Chief of Staff Leon Panetta favored Albright, but a separate faction went for different candidates such as Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, and former Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke.[70] Albright orchestrated a campaign on her own behalf that proved successful.[71] When Albright took office as the 64th U.S. Secretary of State on January 23, 1997, she became the first female U.S. Secretary of State and the highest-ranking woman in the history of the U.S. government at the time of her appointment.[72] Not being a natural-born citizen of the U.S., she was not eligible as a U.S. presidential successor.[73]\nDuring her tenure, Albright considerably influenced American foreign policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Middle East. Following the Dayton Agreement, in which a cease-fire in the Bosnian War was reached, President Clinton committed to sending American troops to Bosnia to enforce the agreement, as strongly recommended by Albright.[74] According to Albright's memoirs, she once argued with Colin Powell for the use of military force by asking, \"What's the point of you saving this superb military for, Colin, if we can't use it?\"[75] Albright strongly advocated for U.S. economic sanctions against Saddam Hussein's Iraq.[76]\nAs Secretary of State, she represented the U.S. at the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. She along with the British contingents boycotted the swearing-in ceremony of the Chinese-appointed Hong Kong Legislative Council, which replaced the elected one.[77] In October 1997, she voiced her approval for national security exemptions to the Kyoto Protocol, arguing that NATO operations should not be limited by controls on greenhouse gas emissions, and hoped that other NATO members would also support the exemptions at the Third Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan.[78]\n\nAlbright with Benjamin Netanyahu (left) and Yasser Arafat at the Wye River Memorandum, 1998\nAccording to several accounts, Prudence Bushnell, U.S. ambassador to Kenya, repeatedly asked Washington for additional security at the embassy in Nairobi, including in a letter directly addressed to Albright in April 1998. Bushnell was ignored.[79] She later stated that when she spoke to Albright about the letter, Albright told her that it had not been shown to her.[80] In Against All Enemies, Richard Clarke writes about an exchange with Albright several months after the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed in August 1998. \"What do you think will happen if you lose another embassy?\" Clarke asked. \"The Republicans in Congress will go after you.\" \"First of all, I didn't lose these two embassies\", Albright shot back. \"I inherited them in the shape they were.\"[81]\nIn 1998, at the NATO summit, Albright articulated what became known as the \"three Ds\" of NATO, \"which is no diminution of NATO, no discrimination and no duplication \u2013 because I think that we don't need any of those three \"Ds\" to happen\".[82]\n\nWith NATO officers during NATO Ceremony of Accession of New Members, 1999\nIn February 1998, Albright partook in a town-hall style meeting at St. John Arena in Columbus where she, William Cohen, and Sandy Berger attempted to make the case for military action in Iraq. The crowd was disruptive, repeatedly drowning out the discussion with boos and anti-war chants. James Rubin downplayed the disruptions, claiming the crowd was supportive of a war policy.[83] Later that year, both Bill Clinton and Albright insisted that an attack on Saddam Hussein could be stopped only if Hussein reversed his decision to halt arms inspections.[84]\nIn an interview on The Today Show, February 19, 1998, Albright said \"If we have to use force, it is because we are America; we are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future....\"[85]\nAlbright became one of the highest level Western diplomats ever to meet Kim Jong-il, the then-leader of communist North Korea, during an official state visit to that country in 2000.[86]\nOn January 8, 2001, in one of her last acts as Secretary of State, Albright made a farewell call to Kofi Annan and said that the U.S. would continue to press Iraq to destroy all its weapons of mass destruction as a condition of lifting economic sanctions, even after the end of the Clinton administration on January 20, 2001.[87]\nAlbright received the U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by the Jefferson Awards Foundation, in 2001.[88]\n\nPost-Clinton administration[edit]\nMadeleine Albright at the World Economic Forum\nFollowing Albright's term as Secretary of State, Czech president V\u00e1clav Havel spoke openly about the possibility of Albright succeeding him. Albright was reportedly flattered, but denied ever seriously considering the possibility of running for office in her country of origin.[89]\nAlbright was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001.[90] Also that year, Albright founded the Albright Group, an international strategy consulting firm based in Washington, D.C., that later become the Albright Stonebridge Group.[91] Affiliated with the firm is Albright Capital Management, which was founded in 2005 to engage in private fund management related to emerging markets.[92]\nAlbright accepted a position on the board of directors of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2003.[93] In 2005, she declined to run for re-election to the board in the aftermath of the Richard Grasso compensation scandal, in which Grasso, the chairman of the NYSE board of directors, had been granted $187.5\u00a0million in compensation, with little governance by the board on which Albright sat.[94] During the tenure of the interim chairman, John S. Reed, Albright served as chairwoman of the NYSE board's nominating and governance committee. Shortly after the appointment of the NYSE board's permanent chairman in 2005, Albright submitted her resignation.[95] According to PolitiFact, Albright opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although after the U.S. was committed to the war, she said she would support the President.[96]\nAlbright served on the board of directors for the Council on Foreign Relations and on the International Advisory Committee of the Brookings Doha Center.[11] As of 2016, she was the Mortara Distinguished Professor of Diplomacy at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C.[97] Albright served as chairperson of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and as president of the Truman Scholarship Foundation.[98] She was also the co-chair of the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor[99] and was the chairwoman of the Council of Women World Leaders Women's Ministerial Initiative up until November 16, 2007, when she was succeeded by Margot Wallstr\u00f6m.[100]\nAlbright guest starred on the television drama Gilmore Girls as herself on October 25, 2005.[101]\nShe also made a guest appearance on Parks and Recreation, in the eighth episode of the seventh season.[102]\nAt the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on November 13, 2007, Albright declared that she and William Cohen would co-chair a new Genocide Prevention Task Force[103] created by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the American Academy of Diplomacy, and the United States Institute for Peace. Their appointment was criticized by Harut Sassounian[104] and the Armenian National Committee of America, as both Albright and Cohen had spoken against a Congressional resolution on the Armenian genocide.[105]\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry greets Albright, February 6, 2013\nAlbright endorsed and supported Hillary Clinton in her 2008 presidential campaign.[106] Albright was a close friend of Clinton and served as an informal advisor on foreign policy matters.[107] On December 1, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama nominated then-Senator Clinton for Albright's former post of Secretary of State.[108]\nDuring this period, she also served as a business consultant and brand ambassador for Herbalife,[109][110] a global multi-level marketing (MLM) corporation that develops and sells dietary supplements. The company is alleged to be a fraudulent pyramid scheme.[111][112]\n\nBob Schieffer and Madeleine Albright at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2017\nIn September 2009, Albright opened an exhibition of her personal jewelry collection at the Museum of Art and Design in New York City, which ran until January 2010.[113] In 2009, Albright also published the book Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat's Jewel Box about her pins.[114]\nIn August 2012, when speaking at an Obama campaign event in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, Albright was asked the question \"How long will you blame that previous administration for all of your problems?\", to which she replied \"Forever\".[115][116] In October 2012, Albright appeared in a video on the official Twitter feed for the Democratic Party, responding to then-GOP candidate Mitt Romney's assertion that Russia was the \"number-one geopolitical foe\" of the United States. According to Albright, Romney's statement was proof that he had \"little understanding of what was actually going on in the 21st Century [and] he is not up to date and that is a very dangerous aspect [of his candidacy]\".[117]\nAlbright described Donald Trump as \"the most un-American, anti-democratic leader\" in U.S. history.[118][119][120] She also criticized the Trump administration for its delay in filling some diplomatic posts as a sign of \"disdain for diplomacy\".[121][122]\nAfter 2016, Albright served as chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, a consulting firm,[123] and chair of the advisory council for The Hague Institute for Global Justice, which was founded in 2011 in The Hague.[124] She also served as an Honorary Chair for the World Justice Project (WJP).[125] The WJP works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the rule of law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.[126]\n\nInvestments[edit]\nAlbright was a co-investor with Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, and George Soros in a $350\u00a0million investment vehicle called Helios Towers Africa, which intends to buy or build thousands of mobile phone towers in Africa.[127][128]\n\nControversies[edit]\nSanctions against Iraq[edit]\nOn May 12, 1996, then-ambassador Albright defended UN sanctions against Iraq on a 60 Minutes segment in which Lesley Stahl asked her, \"We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?\" and Albright replied, \"We think the price is worth it.\"[129][130] The segment won an Emmy Award.[131][132] Albright later criticized Stahl's segment as \"amount[ing] to Iraqi propaganda\", saying that her question was a loaded question.[133][134] She wrote, \"I had fallen into a trap and said something I did not mean\",[135] and that she regretted coming \"across as cold-blooded and cruel\".[129] She apologized for her remarks in a 2020 interview with The New York Times, calling them \"totally stupid\".[136][130]\nWhereas it was widely believed that the sanctions more than doubled Iraq's child mortality rate, research following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq has shown that commonly cited data were fabricated by the Iraqi government and that \"there was no major rise in child mortality in Iraq after 1990 and during the period of the sanctions\".[137][138] Albright addressed the controversy at length in a 2020 memoir: \"In fact, the producers of 60 Minutes were duped. Subsequent research has shown that Iraqi propagandists deceived international observers\u00a0... Per a 2017 article in the British Medical Journal of Global Health, the data 'were rigged to show a huge and sustained\u2014and largely non-existent\u2014rise in child mortality\u00a0... to heighten international concern and so get the international sanctions ended.'\u00a0... This is not to deny that UN sanctions contributed to hardships in Iraq or to say that my answer to Stahl's question wasn't a mistake. They did, and it was.\u00a0... U.S. policy throughout the 1990s was to prevent Iraq from reconstituting its most dangerous weapons programs. Short of another war, UN sanctions were the best means for doing so.\"[139]\n\nArt ownership lawsuit[edit]\nExternal videos Presentation by Michael Dobbs on Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey, May 14, 1999, C-SPAN\nFollowing The Washington Post's profile of Albright by Michael Dobbs, an Austrian man named Philipp Harmer launched legal action against Albright, claiming her father had illegally taken possession of artwork that belonged to his great-grandfather, Karl Nebrich.[140] Nebrich, a German-speaking Prague industrialist, abandoned some of the possessions in his apartment when ethnic Germans were expelled from the country after World War II under the Bene\u0161 decrees. His apartment, at 11 Hrad\u010dansk\u00e1 Street in Prague, was subsequently given to Korbel and his family. Harmer alleged that Korbel stole his great-grandfather's artwork. Counsel for Albright's family stated that Hammer's claim was unfounded.[140]\n\nAllegations of hate speech against Serbs and war profiteering[edit]\nLocation of the Prague incident\nIn late October 2012, during a book signing in the Prague bookstore Pal\u00e1c Knih Luxor, Albright was visited by a group of activists from the Czech organization P\u0159\u00e1tel\u00e9 Srb\u016f na Kosovu (Friends of Serbs in Kosovo). She was filmed saying, \"Disgusting Serbs, get out!\" to the Czech group, which had brought war photos to the signing, some of which showed Serbian victims of the Kosovo War in 1999. The protesters were expelled from the event when police arrived. Two videos of the incident were later posted by the group on their YouTube channel.[141][142] Filmmaker Emir Kusturica expressed thanks to Czech director V\u00e1clav Dvo\u0159\u00e1k for organizing and participating in the demonstration. Together with other protesters, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k also reported Albright to the police, stating that she was spreading ethnic hatred and disrespect to the victims of the war.[143][144]\nAlbright's involvement in the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia was the main cause of the demonstration \u2013 a sensitive topic which became even more controversial when it was revealed that in 2012 her investment firm, Albright Capital Management, was preparing to bid in the proposed privatization of Kosovo's state-owned telecom and postal company, Post and Telecom of Kosovo. In an article published by the New York City-based magazine Bloomberg Businessweek, it was estimated that the deal could be as large as \u20ac600\u00a0million. Serbia opposed the sale, and intended to file a lawsuit to block it, alleging that the rights of former Serbian employees were not respected.[145] The bid never happened and was withdrawn by her investment fund.[146]\n\nHillary Clinton campaign comment[edit]\nAlbright supported Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. While introducing Clinton at a campaign event in New Hampshire ahead of that state's primary, Albright said, \"There's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other\" (a phrase Albright had used on several previous occasions in other contexts).[147] The remark was seen as a rebuke of younger women who supported Clinton's primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, which many women found \"startling and offensive\".[148] In a New York Times op-ed published several days after the remark, Albright said: \"I absolutely believe what I said, that women should help one another, but this was the wrong context and the wrong time to use that line. I did not mean to argue that women should support a particular candidate based solely on gender.\"[147]\n\nHonorary degrees and awards[edit]\nMedlin Olbrajt Square in Pristina, Kosovo named in honor of Madeleine Albright\nAlbright held honorary degrees from Brandeis University (1996), Mount Holyoke College (1997),[149] the University of Washington (2002), Smith College (2003), Washington University in St. Louis (2003),[150] University of Winnipeg (2005), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2007),[151] Knox College (2008),[152] Bowdoin College (2013),[153]\nDickinson College (2014),[154] and Tufts University (2015).[155]\nIn 1998, Albright was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[156] Albright was the second recipient of the Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award presented by the Prague Society for International Cooperation. In March 2000 Albright received an Honorary Silver Medal of Jan Masaryk at a ceremony in Prague sponsored by the Bohemian Foundation and the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[157]\nIn 2010, she was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.[158]\nIn 2020, Albright was named by Time magazine among the world's 100 powerful women who defined the last century.[159]\nAlbright was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists, and creators who are over the age of 50.[160]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAlbright married Joseph Albright in 1959.[33] The couple had three daughters before divorcing in 1982.[161] She had been raised Roman Catholic, but converted to the Episcopal Church upon her marriage in 1959. Her parents had converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1941, during her early childhood, after fleeing Czechoslovakia for England in 1939, to avoid anti-Jewish persecution before they immigrated to the U.S. They never discussed their Jewish ancestry with her later.[13]\nWhen The Washington Post reported on Albright's Jewish ancestry shortly after she had become Secretary of State in 1997, Albright said that the report was a \"major surprise\".[162] Albright said that she did not learn until age 59[163] that both her parents were born and raised in Jewish families. As many as a dozen of her relatives in Czechoslovakia\u2014including three of her grandparents\u2014had been murdered in the Holocaust.[18][19][164]\nIn addition to English, Russian, and Czech, Albright spoke French, German, Polish, and Serbo-Croatian.[165] She also understood spoken Slovak.[166]\nAlbright mentioned her physical fitness and exercise regimen in several interviews. In 2006, she said she was capable of leg pressing 400 pounds (180\u00a0kg).[167][168] Albright was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s by The Guardian in March 2013.[169]\n\nDeath and funeral[edit]\n\n\n\nWikinews has related news:\n Former US Secretary of State Albright dies aged 84\n\nAlbright died from cancer in Washington, D.C., on March 23, 2022, at the age of 84.[170][171][172] Many political figures paid tribute to her, including U.S. presidents Jimmy Carter,[173] Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and former British prime minister Tony Blair.[130]\nHer funeral, held at Washington National Cathedral on April 27, was attended by President Joe Biden, former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former vice president Al Gore, and former secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice,[174][175] as well as presidents Salome Zourabichvili of Georgia\nand Vjosa Osmani of Kosovo.[176]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nMadam Secretary: A Memoir.

She is the world's youngest Nobel Prize laureate, the second Pakistani and the first Pashtun to receive a Nobel Prize.[7] Yousafzai is a human rights advocate for the education of women and children in her native homeland, Swat, where the Pakistani Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Her advocacy has grown into an international movement, and according to former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, she has become Pakistan's \"most prominent citizen.\"[8]\nThe daughter of education activist Ziauddin Yousafzai, she was born to a Yusufzai Pashtun family in Swat and was named after the Afghan folk heroine Malalai of Maiwand. Considering Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Barack Obama, and Benazir Bhutto as her role models,[9] she was also inspired by her father's thoughts and humanitarian work.[10] In early 2009, when she was 11, she wrote a blog under her pseudonym Gul Makai for the BBC Urdu to detail her life during the Taliban's occupation of Swat. The following summer, journalist Adam B. Ellick made a New York Times documentary about her life as the Pakistan Armed Forces launched Operation Rah-e-Rast against the militants in Swat.[5] In 2011, she received Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize.[11][12] She rose in prominence, giving interviews in print and on television, and was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize by activist Desmond Tutu.\nOn 9 October 2012, while on a bus in Swat District after taking an exam, Yousafzai and two other girls were shot by a Taliban gunman in an assassination attempt targeting her for her activism; the gunman fled the scene. She was struck in the head by a bullet and remained unconscious and in critical condition at the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, but her condition later improved enough for her to be transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK.[13] The attempt on her life sparked an international outpouring of support. Deutsche Welle reported in January 2013 that she may have become \"the most famous teenager in the world\".[14] Weeks after the attempted murder, a group of 50 leading Muslim clerics in Pakistan issued a fatw\u0101 against those who tried to kill her.[15] Governments, human rights organizations and feminist groups subsequently condemned the Pakistani Taliban. In response, the Taliban further denounced Yousafzai, indicating plans for a possible second assassination attempt which the Taliban felt was justified as a religious obligation. This sparked another international outcry.[16]\nAfter her recovery, Yousafzai became a more prominent activist for the right to education. Based in Birmingham, she co-founded the Malala Fund, a non-profit organisation, with Shiza Shahid.[17] In 2013, she co-authored I\u00a0Am Malala, an international best seller.[18] In 2013, she received the Sakharov Prize, and in 2014, she was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize with Kailash Satyarthi of India. Aged 17 at the time, she was the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate.[19][20][21] In 2015, she was the subject of the Oscar-shortlisted documentary He Named Me Malala. The 2013, 2014 and 2015 issues of Time magazine featured her as one of the most influential people globally. In 2017 she was awarded honorary Canadian citizenship and became the youngest person to address the House of Commons of Canada.[22]\nYousafzai completed her secondary school education at Edgbaston High School, Birmingham in England from 2013 to 2017.[23] From there she won a place at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, and undertook three years of study for a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE), graduating in 2020.[24] She returned in 2023 to become the youngest ever Honorary Fellow at Linacre College, Oxford.[25]\n\n\nEarly life\nChildhood\nYousafzai with her father (left) and Martin Schulz in Strasbourg, 2013\nYousafzai was born on 12 July 1997 in the Swat District of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, into a lower-middle-class family.[26] She is the daughter of Ziauddin Yousafzai and Toor Pekai Yousafzai.[27] Her family is Sunni Muslim[5] of Pashtun ethnicity, belonging to the Yusufzai tribe.[28] The family did not have enough money for a hospital birth and Yousafzai was born at home with the help of neighbours.[29] She was given her first name Malala (meaning \"grief-stricken\")[30] after Malalai of Maiwand, a famous Pashtun poet and warrior woman from southern Afghanistan.[31] At her house in Mingora, she lived with her two younger brothers, Khushal and Atal, her parents, Ziauddin and Tor Pekai, and two chickens.[5]\nFluent in Pashto, Urdu and English, Yousafzai was educated mostly by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, a poet, school owner,[32] and an educational activist himself, running a chain of private schools known as the Khushal Public School.[33][34] In an interview, she once said that she aspired to become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead.[5] Ziauddin referred to his daughter as something entirely special, allowing her to stay up at night and talk about politics after her two brothers had been sent to bed.[35]\nInspired by the twice-elected, assassinated Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Yousafzai started speaking about education rights as early as September 2008, when her father took her to Peshawar to speak at the local press club.[10] \"How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?\" she asked in a speech covered by newspapers and television channels throughout the region.[36] In 2009, she began as a trainee and was then a peer educator in the Institute for War and Peace Reporting's Open Minds Pakistan youth programme, which worked in the region's schools to help students engage in constructive discussion on social issues through journalism, public debate and dialogue.[37]\n\nAs a BBC blogger\nSee also: First Battle of Swat\nFrom left to right: Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Muhammad Ali Jinnah have influenced Yousafzai.\nIn late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu website and his colleagues came up with a novel way of covering the Pakistani Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to report, as their families considered it too dangerous. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala.[38] At the time, Pakistani Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education,[39] and women from going shopping.[40] Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares.[39] At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but her parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, who was four years younger and in seventh grade at the time.[41] \"We had been covering the violence and politics in Swat in detail but we didn't know much about how ordinary people lived under the Taliban\", said Mirza Waheed, former editor of BBC Urdu. Because they were concerned for Yousafzai's safety, the BBC editors insisted she use a pseudonym.[39] Her blog was published under the byline \"Gul Makai\" (\"cornflower\" in Pashto), a name taken from a character in a Pashtun folktale.[42][39][43][44]\nOn 3 January 2009, her first entry was posted to the BBC Urdu blog. She hand-wrote notes and passed them to a reporter who scanned and e-mailed them.[39] The blog recorded Yousafzai's thoughts during the First Battle of Swat, as military operations took place, fewer girls show up to school, and finally, her school shut down. That day she wrote:\n\nI had a terrible dream yesterday with military helicopters and the Taliban. I have had such dreams since the launch of the military operation in Swat. My mother made me breakfast and I went off to school. I was afraid going to school because the Taliban had issued an edict banning all girls from attending schools. Only 11 out of 27 pupils attended the class because the number decreased because of the Pakistani Taliban's edict. My three friends have shifted to Peshawar, Lahore and Rawalpindi with their families after this edict.[30]\nIn Swat, the Pakistani Taliban had set an edict that no girls could attend school after 15 January 2009. They had already blown up more than 100 girls' schools.[39] The night before the ban took effect was filled with the noise of artillery fire, waking Yousafzai several times. The following day, she also read for the first time excerpts from her blog that were published in a local newspaper.[30]\n\nBanned from school\nFollowing the edict, the Pakistani Taliban destroyed several more local schools. On 24 January 2009, Yousafzai wrote: \"Our annual exams are due after the vacations but this will only be possible if the Pakistani Taliban allow girls to go to school. We were told to prepare certain chapters for the exam but I do not feel like studying.\"[45]\n\n\n\nIt seems that it is only when dozens of schools have been destroyed and hundreds others closed down that the army thinks about protecting them. Had they conducted their operations here properly, this situation would not have arisen.\n\n\n\u2014 Malala Yousafzai, 24 January 2009 BBC blog entry[45]\n\n\nIn February 2009, girls' schools were still closed. In solidarity, private schools for boys had decided not to open until 9 February, and notices appeared saying so.[45] On 7 February, Yousafzai and her brother returned to their hometown of Mingora, where the streets were deserted, and there was an \"eerie silence\". She wrote in her blog: \"We went to the supermarket to buy a gift for our mother but it was closed, whereas earlier it used to remain open till late. Many other shops were also closed.\" Their home had been robbed and their television was stolen.[45]\nAfter boys' schools reopened, the Pakistani Taliban lifted restrictions on girls' primary education, where there was co-education. Girls-only schools were still closed. Yousafzai wrote that only 70 pupils attended out of the 700 who were enrolled.[45]\nOn 15 February, gunshots were heard in Mingora's streets, but Yousafzai's father reassured her, saying, \"Don't be scared\u2014this is firing for peace.\" Her father had read in the newspaper that the government and militants were going to sign a peace deal the next day. Later that night, when the Taliban announced the peace deal on their FM Radio studio, another round of stronger firing started outside.[45] Yousafzai spoke out against the Pakistani Taliban on the national current affairs show Capital Talk on 18 February.[46] Three days later, Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi leader Maulana Fazlulla announced on his FM radio station that he was lifting the ban on women's education, and girls would be allowed to attend school until exams were held on 17 March, but that they had to wear burqas.[45]\n\nGirls' schools reopen\nOn 25 February, Yousafzai wrote on her blog that she and her classmates \"played a lot in class and enjoyed ourselves like we used to before.\"[45] Attendance at Yousafzai's class was up to 19 of 27 pupils by 1 March, but the Pakistani Taliban were still active in the area. Shelling continued, and relief goods meant for displaced people were looted.[45] Only two days later, Yousafzai wrote that there was a skirmish between the military and Taliban, and the sounds of mortar shells could be heard: \"People are again scared that the peace may not last for long. Some people are saying that the peace agreement is not permanent, it is just a break in fighting.\"[45]\nOn 9 March, Yousafzai wrote about a science paper that she performed well on, and added that the Taliban were no longer searching vehicles as they once did. Her blog ended on 12 March 2009.[47]\n\nAs a displaced person\nSee also: Second Battle of Swat\nAfter the BBC diary ended, Yousafzai and her father were approached by New York Times reporter Adam B. Ellick about filming a documentary.[41] In May, the Pakistani Army moved into the region to regain control during the Second Battle of Swat (also known as Operation Rah-e-Rast). Mingora was evacuated and Yousafzai's family was displaced and separated. Her father went to Peshawar to protest and lobby for support, while she was sent into the countryside to live with relatives. \"I'm really bored because I have no books to read,\" she is filmed saying in the documentary.[5]\nThat month, after criticising militants at a press conference, Yousafzai's father received a death threat over the radio by a Pakistani Taliban commander.[5] Yousafzai was deeply inspired in her activism by her father. That summer, for the first time, she committed to becoming a politician and not a doctor, as she had once aspired to be.[5]\n\n\n\nI have a new dream ... I must be a politician to save this country. There are so many crises in our country. I want to remove these crises.\n\n\n\u2014 Malala Yousafzai, Class Dismissed (documentary)[5]\n\n\nBy early July, refugee camps were filled to capacity. The prime minister made a long-awaited announcement saying it was safe to return to the Swat Valley. The Pakistani military had pushed the Taliban out of the cities and into the countryside. Yousafzai's family reunited, and on 24 July 2009 they headed home. They made one stop first\u2014to meet with a group of other grassroots activists that had been invited to see United States President Barack Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke. Yousafzai pleaded with Holbrooke to intervene in the situation, saying, \"Respected ambassador, if you can help us in our education, so please help us.\" When her family finally returned home, they found it had not been damaged, and her school had sustained only light damage.[5]\n\nEarly activism\nPrime Minister Benazir Bhutto, one of Yousafzai's sources of inspiration\nFollowing the documentary, Yousafzai was interviewed on the national Pashto-language station AVT Khyber, the Urdu-language Daily Aaj, and Canada's Toronto Star.[41] She made a second appearance on Capital Talk on 19 August 2009.[48] Her BBC blogging identity was being revealed in articles by December 2009.[49][50] She also began appearing on television to publicly advocate for female education.[40] From 2009 to 2010 she was the chair of the District Child Assembly of the Khpal Kor Foundation.[51][52]\nIn 2011, Yousafzai trained with local girls' empowerment organisation, Aware Girls, run by Gulalai Ismail, whose training included advice on women's rights and empowerment to peacefully oppose radicalisation through education.[53]\nIn October 2011, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a South African activist, nominated Yousafzai for the International Children's Peace Prize of the Dutch international children's advocacy group, KidsRights Foundation. She was the first Pakistani girl to be nominated for the award. The announcement said, \"Malala dared to stand up for herself and other girls and used national and international media to let the world know girls should also have the right to go to school.\"[54] The award was won by Michaela Mycroft of South Africa.[55]\nYousafzai's public profile rose even further when she was awarded Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize two months later in December.[39][54] On 19 December 2011, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani awarded her the National Peace Award for Youth. At the ceremony, she stated she was not a member of any political party, but hoped to found a national party of her own to promote education.[56] The prime minister directed the authorities to set up an IT campus in the Swat Degree College for Women at Yousafzai's request, and a secondary school was renamed in her honour.[57] By 2012, she was planning to organise the Malala Education Foundation, which would help poor girls go to school.[58] In 2012, she attended the International Marxist Tendency National Marxist Summer School.[59][60] In a television interview the same year, she named Barack Obama, Benazir Bhutto and Abdul Ghaffar Khan (Bacha Khan), a Pashtun leader known for his nonviolent Khudai Khidmatgar resistance movement against the British Raj, as inspirations for her activism.[9]\n\nMurder attempt\nAs Yousafzai became more recognised, the dangers facing her increased. Death threats against her were published in newspapers and slipped under her door.[61] On Facebook, where she was an active user, she began to receive threats.[39] Eventually, a Pakistani Taliban spokesman said they were \"forced\" to act. In a meeting held in the summer of 2012, Taliban leaders unanimously agreed to kill her.[61]\n\n\n\nI think of it often and imagine the scene clearly. Even if they come to kill me, I will tell them what they are trying to do is wrong, that education is our basic right.\n\n\n\u2014 Malala Yousafzai envisioning a confrontation with the Taliban[39]\n\n\nOn 9 October 2012, a Taliban gunman shot Yousafzai as she rode home on a bus after taking an exam in Pakistan's Swat Valley. Yousafzai was 15 years old at the time. According to reports, a masked gunman shouted: \"Which one of you is Malala? Speak up, otherwise I will shoot you all.\"[34] Upon being identified, Yousafzai was shot with one bullet, which travelled 18 inches (46\u00a0cm) from the side of her left eye, through her neck and landed in her shoulder.[62][63] Two other girls were also wounded in the shooting: Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan,[64] both of whom were stable enough following the shooting to speak to reporters and provide details of the attack.\n\nMedical treatment\nAfter the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a military hospital in Peshawar, where doctors were forced to operate after swelling developed in the left portion of her brain, which had been damaged by the bullet when it passed through her head.[65] After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of her skull was removed to allow room for swelling.[66]\nOn 11 October 2012, a panel of Pakistani and British doctors decided to move Yousafzai to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi.[66] Mumtaz Khan, a doctor, said that she had a 70% chance of survival.[67] Interior Minister Rehman Malik said that Yousafzai would be moved to Germany, where she could receive the best medical treatment, as soon as she was stable enough to travel. A team of doctors would travel with her, and the government would bear the cost of her treatment.[68][69] Doctors reduced Yousafzai's sedation on 13 October, and she moved all four limbs.[70]\nOffers to treat Yousafzai came from around the world.[71] On 15 October, Yousafzai travelled to the United Kingdom for further treatment, approved by both her doctors and family. Her plane landed in Birmingham, England, where she was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, one of the specialties of this hospital being the treatment of military personnel injured in conflict.[72] According to media reports at the time, the UK Government stated that \"[t]he Pakistani government is paying all transport, migration, medical, accommodation and subsistence costs for Malala and her party.\"[73]\nYousafzai had come out of her coma by 17 October 2012, was responding well to treatment, and was said to have a good chance of fully recovering without any brain damage.[74] Later updates on 20 and 21 October stated that she was stable, but was still battling an infection.[75] By 8 November, she was photographed sitting up in bed.[76] On 11 November, Yousafzai underwent surgery for eight and a half hours, in order to repair her facial nerve.[62]\nOn 3 January 2013, Yousafzai was discharged from the hospital to continue her rehabilitation at her family's temporary home in the West Midlands,[77][78] where she had weekly physiotherapy.[62] She underwent a five-hour-long operation on 2 February to reconstruct her skull and restore her hearing with a cochlear implant, after which she was reported to be in stable condition.[79][80] Yousafzai wrote in July 2014 that her facial nerve had recovered up to 96%.[62]\n\nReaction\nBarack Obama, Michelle Obama and their daughter Malia meet Yousafzai in the Oval Office, 11 October 2013.\nThe murder attempt received worldwide media coverage and produced an outpouring of sympathy and anger. Protests against the shooting were held in several Pakistani cities the day after the attack, and over 2\u00a0million people signed the Right to Education campaign's petition, which led to ratification[81][82] of the first Right to Education Bill in Pakistan.[83] Pakistani officials offered a 10\u00a0million rupee (\u2248US$105,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the attackers. Responding to concerns about his safety, Yousafzai's father said: \"We wouldn't leave our country if my daughter survives or not. We have an ideology that advocates peace. The Taliban cannot stop all independent voices through the force of bullets.\"[69]\nPakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari described the shooting as an attack on \"civilized people\".[84] UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a \"heinous and cowardly act\".[85] United States President Barack Obama found the attack \"reprehensible, disgusting and tragic\",[86] while Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Yousafzai had been \"very brave in standing up for the rights of girls\" and that the attackers had been \"threatened by that kind of empowerment\".[87] British Foreign Secretary William Hague called the shooting \"barbaric\" and that it had \"shocked Pakistan and the world\".[88]\nAmerican singer Madonna dedicated her song \"Human Nature\" to Yousafzai at a concert in Los Angeles the day of the attack,[89] and also had a temporary Malala tattoo on her back.[90] American actress Angelina Jolie wrote an article explaining the event to her children and answering questions like \"Why did those men think they needed to kill Malala?\"[91] Jolie later donated $200,000 to the Malala Fund[92] for girls' education.[93] Former First Lady of the United States, Laura Bush wrote an op-ed piece in The Washington Post in which she compared Yousafzai to Holocaust diarist Anne Frank.[94]\nEhsanullah Ehsan, chief spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that Yousafzai \"is the symbol of the infidels and obscenity\", adding that if she survived, the group would target her again.[95]\nIn the days following the attack, the Pakistani Taliban reiterated its justification, saying Yousafzai had been brainwashed by her father: \"We warned him several times to stop his daughter from using dirty language against us, but he didn't listen and forced us to take this extreme step.\"[64] The Pakistani Taliban also justified its attack as part of religious scripture, stating that the Quran says that \"people propagating against Islam and Islamic forces would be killed\", going on to say that \"Sharia says that even a child can be killed if he is propagating against Islam\".[96]\nOn 12 October 2012, a group of  Islamic clerics in Pakistan issued a fatw\u0101 \u2013 a ruling of Islamic law \u2013 against the Taliban gunmen who tried to kill Yousafzai. Islamic scholars from the Sunni Ittehad Council publicly denounced attempts by the Pakistani Taliban to mount religious justifications for the shooting of Yousafzai and two of her classmates.[97]\nAlthough the attack was roundly condemned in Pakistan,[98] \"some fringe Pakistani political parties and extremist outfits\" have aired conspiracy theories, such as the shooting being staged by the American Central Intelligence Agency to provide an excuse for continuing drone attacks.[99] The Pakistani Taliban and some other pro-Pakistani Taliban elements branded Yousafzai an \"American spy\".[100][101][102][103]\n\nUnited Nations petition\nOn 15 October 2012, UN Special Envoy for Global Education, Gordon Brown, the former British Prime Minister, visited Yousafzai while she was in the hospital,[104] and launched a petition in her name and \"in support of what Malala fought for\".[105] Using the slogan \"I am Malala\", the petition's main demand was that there be no child left out of school by 2015, with the hope that \"girls like Malala everywhere will soon be going to school\".[106] Brown said he would hand the petition to President Zardari in Islamabad in November.[105]\nThe petition contains three demands:\n\nWe call on Pakistan to agree to a plan to deliver education for every child.\nWe call on all countries to outlaw discrimination against girls.\nWe call on international organisations to ensure the world's 61\u00a0million out-of-school children are in education by the end of 2015.[106]\nCriminal investigation, arrests, and acquittals\nThe day after the shooting, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik stated that the Taliban gunman who shot Yousafzai had been identified.[107] Police named 23-year-old Atta Ullah Khan, a graduate student in chemistry, as the gunman in the attack.[108] As of 2015[update], he remained at large, possibly in Afghanistan.[109][110]\nThe police also arrested six men for involvement in the attack, but they were later released due to lack of evidence.[109] In November 2012, US sources confirmed that Mullah Fazlullah, the cleric who ordered the attack on Yousafzai, was hiding in eastern Afghanistan.[111] He was killed by a U.S.-Afghan air strike in June 2018.[112]\nOn 12 September 2014, ISPR Director, Major General Asim Bajwa, told a media briefing in Islamabad that the 10 attackers belonged to a militant group called \"Shura\". General Bajwa said that Israrur Rehman was the first member of the militant group to be identified and apprehended by troops. Acting upon the information received during his interrogation, all other members of the militant group were arrested. It was an intelligence-based joint operation conducted by ISI, police, and the military.[113][114]\nIn April 2015, it was first reported that the ten men who had been arrested were sentenced to life in prison by Judge Mohammad Amin Kundi, a counterterrorism judge, with the chance of eligibility for parole, and possible release, after 25 years. It is not known whether the actual would-be murderers were among the ten sentenced.[110] But in June it was revealed that eight of the ten men, who were tried in-camera for the attack, and actually confessed to helping plan the attack, had in fact been acquitted in the secret trial. Insiders revealed that one of the men acquitted and freed had been the mastermind behind the murder bid. It is believed that all the other men involved in the shooting of Yousafzai fled to Afghanistan soon afterwards and were never even captured. The information about the release of suspects came to light after the London Daily Mirror attempted to locate the men in prison. Senior police official Salim Khan and the Pakistan High Commission in London stated that the eight men were released because there was not enough evidence to connect them to the attack.[115][116]\n\nEducation\nFrom March 2013 to July 2017, Yousafzai was a pupil at the all-girls Edgbaston High School in Birmingham.[23] In August 2015, she received 6 A*s and 4 As at GCSE level.[117] At A-Level, she studied Geography, History, Mathematics and Religious Studies.[118] Also applying to Durham University, the University of Warwick and the London School of Economics (LSE), Yousafzai was interviewed at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in December 2016 and received a conditional offer of three As in her A\u2011Levels; in August 2017, she was accepted to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE).[118][119]\nIn February 2020, climate change activist Greta Thunberg travelled to Oxford University to meet Yousafzai.[120] On 19 June 2020, Yousafzai said after passing her final examinations that she had completed her PPE degree at Oxford;[121] she graduated with honours.[122]\n\nContinuing activism\n\n\nTraditions are not sent from heaven, they are not sent from God. It is we who make cultures and we have the right to change it and we should change it.\n\n\n\u2014Yousafzai at the Girl Summit in London[123]\n\n\n\n\nInnocent victims are killed in these acts, and they lead to resentment among the Pakistani people. If we refocus efforts on education it will make a big impact.\n\n\n\u2014Yousafzai expressing her concerns to Barack Obama that drone attacks are fueling terrorism[124]\n\n\n\n\nI am convinced Socialism is the only answer and I urge all comrades to take this struggle to a victorious conclusion. Only this will free us from the chains of bigotry and exploitation.\n\n\n\u2014Yousafzai expressing her belief in socialism in a letter to a meeting of Pakistani Marxists in Lahore[125]\n\n\nYousafzai addressed the United Nations in July 2013,[126][127] and had an audience with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace.[128] In September, she spoke at Harvard University,[128] and in October, she met with US President Barack Obama and his family; during that meeting, she confronted him on his use of drone strikes in Pakistan.[124] In December, she addressed the Oxford Union.[129] In July 2014, Yousafzai spoke at the Girl Summit in London.[130] In October 2014, she donated $50,000 to the UNRWA for reconstruction of schools on the Gaza Strip.[131]\nEven though she was fighting for women's rights as well as children's rights, Yousafzai did not describe herself as a feminist when asked on Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014.[132][133] In 2015, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign.[134]\nOn 12 July 2015, her 18th birthday, Yousafzai opened a school in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, near the Syrian border, for Syrian refugees. The school, funded by the not-for-profit Malala Fund, offers education and training to girls aged 14 to 18 years. Yousafzai called on world leaders to invest in \"books, not bullets\".[135][136]\nYousafzai has repeatedly condemned the Rohingya persecution in Myanmar. In June 2015, the Malala Fund released a statement in which Yousafzai argues that the Rohingya people deserve \"citizenship in the country where they were born and have lived for generations\" along with \"equal rights and opportunities.\" She urges world leaders, particularly in Myanmar, to \"halt the inhuman persecution of Burma's Muslim minority Rohingya people.\"[137][138] In September 2017, speaking in Oxford, Yousafzai said: \"This should be a human rights issue. Governments should react to it. People are being displaced, they're facing violence.\"[139] Yousafzai also posted a statement on Twitter calling for Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to condemn the treatment of the Rohingya people in Myanmar. Suu Kyi has avoided taking sides in the conflict, or condemning violence against the Rohingya people, leading to widespread criticism.[140]\nIn 2014, Yousafzai stated that she wished to return to Pakistan following her education in the UK, and inspired by Benazir Bhutto, she would consider running for prime minister: \"If I can help my country by joining the government or becoming the prime minister, I would definitely be up for this task.\"[141] She repeated this aim in 2015[142] and 2016.[143] However, Yousafzai noted in 2018 that her goal had changed, stating that \"now that I have met so many presidents and prime ministers around the world, it just seems that things are not simple and there are other ways that I can bring the change that I want to see.\"[144] In a 2018 interview with David Letterman for Netflix's show My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, Yousafzai was asked: \"Would you ever want to hold a political position?\" She replied: \"Me? No.\"[145]\n\nRepresentation\nFormer British Prime Minister Gordon Brown arranged for Yousafzai's appearance before the United Nations in July 2013.[104] Brown also requested that McKinsey consultant Shiza Shahid, a friend of the Yousafzai family, chair Yousafzai's charity fund, which had gained the support of Angelina Jolie.[104] Google's vice-president Megan Smith also sits on the fund's board.[146]\nIn November 2012, the consulting firm Edelman began work for Yousafzai on a pro bono basis, which according to the firm \"involves providing a press office function for Malala\".[104][146] The office employs five people, and is headed by speechwriter Jamie Lundie.[146] McKinsey also continues to provide assistance to Yousafzai.[146]\n\nMalala Day\nYousafzai on a special visit to Strasbourg in November 2013\nMalala with Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis in 2015\nOn 12 July 2013, Yousafzai's 16th birthday, she spoke at the UN to call for worldwide access to education. The UN dubbed the event \"Malala Day\".[127] Yousafzai wore one of Benazir Bhutto's shawls to the UN. It was her first public speech since the attack,[147] leading the first ever Youth Takeover of the UN, with an audience of over 500 young education advocates from around the world.[148]\n\nThe terrorists thought they would change my aims and stop my ambitions, but nothing changed in my life except this: weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born ... I am not against anyone, neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group. I'm here to speak up for the right of education for every child. I want education for the sons and daughters of the Taliban and all terrorists and extremists.[147]\nYousafzai received several standing ovations. Ban Ki-moon, who also spoke at the session, described her as \"our hero\".[127] Yousafzai also presented the chamber with \"The Education We Want\",[149] a Youth Resolution of education demands written by Youth for Youth, in a process co-ordinated by the UN Global Education First Youth Advocacy Group,[150] telling her audience:\n\nMalala day is not my day. Today is the day of every woman, every boy and every girl who have raised their voice for their rights.[151]\nThe Pakistani government did not comment on Yousafzai's UN appearance, amid a backlash against her in Pakistan's press and social media.[152][153]\nWords from the speech were used as lyrics for \"Speak Out\", a song by Kate Whitley commissioned by BBC Radio 3 and broadcast on International Women's Day 2017.[154][155]\n\nJon Stewart interview\nOn 8 October 2013 Malala, at the age of 16, visited The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, an American television programme, her first major late night appearance.[156][157] She was there as a guest to promote her book, I Am Malala. On the program they discussed her assassination attempt, human rights, and women's education.[158] She left Jon Stewart speechless when she described her thoughts after learning the Pakistani Taliban wanted her dead, saying:\n\nI started thinking about that, and I used to think that the Talib would come, and he would just kill me. But then I said, \"If he comes, what would you do Malala?\" then I would reply to myself, \"Malala, just take a shoe and hit him.\" But then I said, \"If you hit a Talib with your shoe, then there would be no difference between you and the Talib. You must not treat others with cruelty and that much harshly, you must fight others but through peace and through dialogue and through education.\" Then I said I will tell him how important education is and that \"I even want education for your children as well.\" And I will tell him, \"That\"s what I want to tell you, now do what you want.[159]\nStewart, visibly moved by her words, ended the conversation saying: \"I am humbled to speak with you.\"[160] Stewart would again have her as a guest on the show after the 2015 Charleston Church Shooting, in which he started the show citing no jokes saying, \"our guest is an incredible person who suffered unspeakable violence by extremists and her perseverance and determination through that to continue on is an incredible inspiration and to be quite honest with you, I don't think there's anyone else in the world I would rather talk to tonight than Malala so that's what we'll do and sorry about no jokes.\"[161][162][163]\n\nNobel Peace Prize\nExternal videos Nobel Lecture by Malala Yousafzai\nYousafzai's shawl on display at the Nobel Prize Museum\nOn 10 October 2014, Yousafzai was announced as the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize for her struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education. Having received the prize at the age of 17, Yousafzai is the youngest Nobel laureate.[20][21][164] Yousafzai shared the prize with Kailash Satyarthi, a children's rights activist from India.[165] She is the second Pakistani to receive a Nobel Prize after 1979 Physics laureate Abdus Salam.[166]\nAfter she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, there was praise, but also some disapproval of the decision.[167][168] A Norwegian jurist, Fredrik Heffermehl, commented on being awarded the Nobel Prize: \"This is not for fine people who have done nice things and are glad to receive it. All of that is irrelevant. What Nobel wanted was a prize that promoted global disarmament.\"[169]\nAd\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, a college student from Mexico City and asylum seeker, interrupted Yousafzai's Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in protest for the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping in Mexico, but was quickly taken away by security personnel. Yousafzai later sympathised, and acknowledged that problems are faced by young people all over the world, saying \"there are problems in Mexico, there are problems even in America, even here in Norway, and it is really important that children raise their voices\".[170]\n\nDavid Letterman interview\nIn March 2018, Yousafzai was the subject of an interview with David Letterman for his Netflix show My Next Guest Needs No Introduction. Speaking about the Taliban, she opined that their misogyny comes from a superiority complex, and is reinforced by finding \"excuses\" in culture or literature, such as by misinterpreting teachings of Islam.[171] On the topic of her attackers, Yousafzai comments: \"I forgive them because that's the best revenge I can have.\" Pointing out that the person who attacked her was a young boy, she says: \"He thought he was doing the right thing\".[172]\nAsked about the presidency of Donald Trump, Yousafzai said: \"Some of the things have really disappointed me, like sexual harassment and the ban on Muslims and racism.\"[173] She also criticised the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to education, saying that education is the first step to \"eradicating extremism and ending poverty\". Throughout the episode, clips are shown of Yousafzai acting as a tour guide for prospective students to her college Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.[171]\n\nAfghanistan\nIn July 2021, amid a major offensive by the Taliban insurgents, Yousafzai urged the international community to press for an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan and provide humanitarian aid to Afghan civilians.[174] Following the Taliban takeover of Kabul on 15 August 2021, she expressed concern about the fate of women's rights, fearing that women in Afghanistan would lose the social and educational gains that had been made during the previous Afghan government's two decades.[175]\nYousafzai condemned the Taliban's ban on girls' education beyond 6th grade, and said \"the Taliban will continue to make excuses to prevent girls from learning beyond primary school.\"[176] She said the Taliban \"want to erase girls and women from all public life in Afghanistan,\" and asked \"leaders around the world to take collective action to hold the Taliban accountable for violating the human rights of millions of women and girls.\"[177]\n\nWomen's clothing, marriage\nYousafzai  had said that she did not understand why people had to marry. After her own marriage in 2021 she said that she had not been against marriage, but had concerns about it related to child marriage and forced marriage, and unequal marriages where \"women make more compromises than men\". In her own marriage she felt that she had found a person who understood her values.[178]\nOn 7 March 2022, Malala Yousafzai advocated for every woman's right to decide to wear what she likes for herself, from a burqa to a bikini: \"Come and talk to us about individual freedom and autonomy, about preventing harm and violence, about education and emancipation. Do not come with your wardrobe notes.\"[179]\n\nPersonal life\nOn 9 November 2021, Yousafzai married Asser Malik, a manager with the Pakistan Cricket Board,[178][180] in Birmingham.[181][182]\n\nReception\nPakistan\nHer opposition to the policy of Talibanisation made her unpopular among Taliban sympathisers.[183][184] A Dawn columnist said she was scapegoated by the \"failing state government,\"[183] and a journalist in The Nation wrote Yousafzai was hated by \"overzealous patriots\" who were keen to deny the oppression of women in Pakistan.[184] Her statements conflicted with the view that militancy in Pakistan was a result of Western interference,[152] and conservatives and Islamic fundamentalists described her ideology as \"anti-Pakistan\".[185][186]\nIn 2015, the All Pakistan Private Schools Federation (APPSF) banned her autobiographical book, I Am Malala, at all Pakistani private schools, with the APPSF president Mirza Kashif Ali releasing his own book against her, I Am Not Malala.[187] His book accused Yousafzai of attacking the Pakistan Armed Forces under the pretence of female education, described her father as a \"double agent\" and \"traitor\", and denounced the Malala Fund's promotion of secular education. However, Ali pointed out that the APPSF had gone on a national strike when Yousafzai was attacked by the Pakistani Taliban.[188] Conspiracy theorists in newspapers and social media also alleged that Yousafzai had staged her assassination attempt, or that she was an agent of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).[153][152] Many Pakistanis view her as an \"agent of the West\",[189] due to her Nobel prize, Oxford education and residence in England.[190] Another conspiracy theory alleges that Yousafzai is a Jewish agent.[190][185] Farman Nawaz argued in Daily Outlook Afghanistan that Yousafzai would have gained more fame in Pakistan if she belonged to the province of Punjab.[191] Yousafzai is seen as courageous by some Pakistanis.[185]\nOn 29 March 2018, Yousafzai returned to Pakistan for the first time since the shooting. Meeting Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi,[192] she gave a speech in which she said it had been her dream to return without any fear.[193] Yousafzai then visited her hometown Mingora in Swat District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[194] The APPSF, representing 173,000 private schools in Pakistan, organised an \"I Am Not Malala Day\" on 30 March in response to what the federation said were her \"anti-Islam and anti-Pakistan\" views.[187] Yousafzai responded by saying \"I am proud of my religion and country.\"[186]\n\nIndia\nMany people in India have accused Yousafzai of spreading the \"Pakistani agenda\" over the Kashmir conflict, and being selective in condemning human rights abuses. On 7 August 2019, following the Indian revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, Yousafzai expressed her concern about the situation and appealed to the international community to ensure peace in Jammu and Kashmir.[195]\nOn 14 September 2019, Malala posted a tweet, in which she said that a Kashmiri girl told her: \"I feel purposeless and depressed because I can't go to school. I missed my exams on August 12 and I feel my future is insecure now.\"[196][197] However, many Twitter users pointed out that on 12 August 2019, it was Eid al-Adha in India, a public holiday when schools were closed across the country, so an exam would not be even possible on that day.[198] After her tweet, Yousafzai was widely criticised on Twitter, including by some Indian celebrities.[199][200][201][202]\n\nWorks\nInternational Poetry Festival 2013 in Argentina, to honour Yousafzai\nYousafzai's memoir I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban, co-written with British journalist Christina Lamb, was published in October 2013 by Little, Brown and Company in the US and by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK.[203] Fatima Bhutto, reviewing the book for The Guardian called the book \"fearless\" and stated that \"the haters and conspiracy theorists would do well to read this book\", though she criticised \"the stiff, know-it-all voice of a foreign correspondent\" that is interwoven with Yousafzai's.[204] Marie Arana for The Washington Post called the book \"riveting\" and wrote \"It is difficult to imagine a chronicle of a war more moving, apart from perhaps the diary of Anne Frank.\"[205] Tina Jordan in Entertainment Weekly gave the book a \"B+\", writing \"Malala's bravely eager voice can seem a little thin here, in I Am Malala, likely thanks to her co-writer, but her powerful message remains undiluted.\"[206]\n\nYousafzai at Women of the World Festival, 2014\nA children's edition of the memoir was published in 2014 under the title I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World.[207] According to Publishers Weekly, in 2017 the book had sold almost 2\u00a0million copies, and there were 750,000 copies of the children's edition in print.[208]\nYousafzai was the subject of the 2015 documentary He Named Me Malala, which was shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.[209] In 2020, an Indian Hindi-language biographical film Gul Makai by H. E. Amjad Khan was released, with Reem Sameer Shaikh portraying her.[210]\nYousafzai authored a picture book, Malala's Magic Pencil, which was illustrated by Kerasco\u00ebt and published on 17 October 2017.[211] By March 2018, The Bookseller reported that the book had over 5,000 sales in the UK.[212] In a review for The Guardian, Imogen Carter describes the book as \"enchanting\", opining that it \"strikes just the right balance\" between \"heavy-handed\" and \"heartfelt\", and is a \"welcome addition to the frustratingly small range of children's books that feature BAME central characters\".[213] Rebecca Gurney of The Daily Californian gives the book a grade of 4.5 out of 5, calling it a \"beautiful account of a terrifying but inspiring tale\" and commenting \"Though the story begins with fantasy, it ends starkly grounded in reality.\"[214]\nIn March 2018, it was announced that Yousafzai's next book We Are Displaced: True Stories of Refugee Lives[215] would be published on 4 September 2018 by Little, Brown and Company's Young Readers division. The book is about refugees, and includes stories from Yousafzai's own life along with those of people she has met.[216] Speaking about the book, Yousafzai said that \"What tends to get lost in the current refugee crisis is the humanity behind the statistics\"[215][217] and \"people become refugees when they have no other option.

A member of the Republican Party, he served as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives from 2006 to 2008. Rubio unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2016, winning presidential primaries in Minnesota, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\nRubio is a Cuban American from Miami, Florida. After serving as a city commissioner for West Miami in the 1990s, he was elected to represent the 111th district in the Florida House of Representatives in 2000. Subsequently, he was elected speaker of the Florida House; he served for two years beginning in November 2006. Upon leaving the Florida legislature in 2008 due to term limits, Rubio taught at Florida International University.\nRubio was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010. In April 2015, he announced a presidential bid instead of seeking reelection to the Senate. He suspended his campaign for the presidency on March 15, 2016, after losing the Florida Republican primary to the eventual winner of the presidential election, Donald Trump. He then decided to run for reelection to the Senate, winning a second term later that year. During the 2016 Republican presidential primary campaign in which Rubio and Trump were opponents, Rubio was critical of Trump. Rubio ultimately endorsed Trump before the 2016 general election and was largely supportive of Trump during his presidency. Due to his influence on U.S. policy on Latin America during the Trump administration, he was described as a \"virtual secretary of state for Latin America\".[1] Rubio became Florida's senior senator in January 2019, following the defeat of Bill Nelson, and was reelected to a third term in 2022, defeating Democratic nominee Val Demings. Rubio endorsed Trump for president in 2024 days before the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nRubio's 1989 high school yearbook photo\nMarco Antonio Rubio was born in Miami, Florida,[2] the second son and third child of Mario Rubio Reina[3] and Oriales (n\u00e9e Garcia) Rubio. His parents were Cubans who immigrated to the United States in 1956 during the regime of Fulgencio Batista, two and a half years before Fidel Castro ascended to power after the Cuban Revolution.[4] His mother made at least four return trips to Cuba after Castro's takeover, including a month-long trip in 1961.[4] Neither of Rubio's parents was a U.S. citizen at the time of Rubio's birth,[5][6] but his parents applied for U.S. citizenship and were naturalized in 1975.[4] Some relatives of Rubio's were admitted to the U.S. as refugees.[7]\nRubio's maternal grandfather, Pedro Victor Garcia, immigrated to the U.S. legally in 1956, but returned to Cuba to find work in 1959.[8] When he fled communist Cuba and returned to the U.S. in 1962 without a visa,[9] he was detained as an undocumented immigrant and an immigration judge ordered him to be deported.[8][10] Immigration officials reversed their decision later that day, the deportation order was not enforced, and Garcia was given a legal status of \"parolee\" that allowed him to stay in the U.S.[11][12][13] Garcia re-applied for permanent resident status in 1966 following passage of the Cuban Adjustment Act, at which point his residency was approved.[11] Rubio enjoyed a close relationship with his grandfather during his childhood.[11]\nIn October 2011, The Washington Post reported that Rubio's previous statements that his parents were forced to leave Cuba in 1959 (after Fidel Castro came to power) were falsehoods.[4] His parents actually left Cuba in 1956, during the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.[4] According to the Post, \"[in] Florida, being connected to the post-revolution exile community gives a politician cachet that could never be achieved by someone identified with the pre-Castro exodus, a group sometimes viewed with suspicion.\"[4] Rubio denied that he had embellished his family history, stating that his public statements about his family were based on \"family lore\".[4] Rubio asserted that his parents intended to return to Cuba in the 1960s.[4] He added that his mother took his two elder siblings back to Cuba in 1961 with the intention of living there permanently (his father remained behind in Miami \"wrapping up the family's matters\"), but the nation's move toward communism caused the family to change its plans.[4] Rubio stated that \"[the] essence of my family story is why they came to America in the first place; and why they had to stay.\"[14]\nRubio has three siblings: older brother Mario, older sister Barbara (married to Orlando Cicilia), and younger sister Veronica (formerly married to entertainer Carlos Ponce).[15] Growing up, his family was Catholic, though from age\u00a08 to age\u00a011 he and his family attended the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints while living in Las Vegas.[16] During those years in Nevada, his father worked as a bartender at Sam's Town Hotel and his mother as a housekeeper at the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino.[17] He received his first communion as a Catholic in 1984 before moving back to Miami with his family a year later. He was confirmed and later married in the Catholic Church.[18][19]\nRubio attended South Miami Senior High School, graduating in 1989. He attended Tarkio College in Missouri for one year on a football scholarship before enrolling at Santa Fe Community College (now Santa Fe College) in Gainesville, Florida. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Florida in 1993 and his Juris Doctor cum laude from the University of Miami School of Law in 1996.[20][21] Rubio has said that he incurred $100,000 in student loans. He paid off those loans in 2012.[22]\n\nCareer\nWhile studying law, Rubio interned for U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.[23] He also worked on Republican senator Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign.[24][25] In April 1998, two years after finishing law school, Rubio was elected to a seat as city commissioner for West Miami.[26] He became a member of the Florida House of Representatives in early 2000.[27][28][29]\n\nFlorida House of Representatives\nRubio and Mario D\u00edaz-Balart in 2001\nElections and concurrent employment\nIn late 1999, a special election was called to fill the seat for the 111th House District in the Florida House of Representatives, representing Miami.[30] It was considered a safe Republican seat, so Rubio's main challenge was to win the GOP nomination. He campaigned as a moderate, advocating tax cuts and early childhood education.[29]\nRubio placed second in the Republican primary on December 14, 1999,[31] but won the runoff election for the Republican nomination, defeating Angel Zayon (a television and radio reporter who was popular with Cuban exiles) by just 64 votes.[29][32] He then defeated Democrat Anastasia Garcia with 72% of the vote in a January 25, 2000, special election.[33]\nIn November 2000, Rubio was reelected unopposed.[34] In 2002, he was reelected to a second term unopposed.[35] In 2004, he was reelected to a third term with 66% of the vote.[36] In 2006, he was reelected to a fourth term unopposed.[37]\nRubio spent almost nine years in the Florida House of Representatives. Since the Florida legislative session officially lasted only sixty days, he spent about half of each year in Miami, where he practiced law, first at a law firm that specialized in land use and zoning until 2014 when he took a position with Broad and Cassel, a Miami law and lobbying firm (though state law precluded him from engaging in lobbying or introducing legislation on behalf of the firm's clients).[29][38]\n\nTenure\nRubio's official portrait as a Florida State Representative\nWhen Rubio took his seat in the legislature in Tallahassee in January 2000, voters in Florida had recently approved a constitutional amendment on term limits. This created openings for new legislative leaders due to many senior incumbents having to retire. According to an article in National Journal, Rubio also gained an extra advantage in that regard, because he was sworn in early due to the special election, and he would take advantage of these opportunities to join the GOP leadership.[29]\n\nMajority whip and majority leader\nLater in 2000, the majority leader of the House, Mike Fasano, promoted Rubio to be one of two majority whips.[29] National Journal described that position as typically requiring a lot of arm-twisting, but said Rubio took a different approach that relied more on persuading legislators and less on coercing them.[29]\nFasano resigned in September 2001 as majority leader of the House due to disagreements with the House speaker, and the speaker passed over Rubio to appoint a more experienced replacement for Fasano. Rubio volunteered to work on redistricting, which he accomplished by dividing the state into five regions, then working individually with the lawmakers involved, and this work helped to cement his relationships with GOP leaders.[29]\nIn December 2002, Rubio was appointed House majority leader by Speaker Johnnie Byrd.[39][40] He persuaded Speaker Byrd to restructure the job of majority leader, so that legislative wrangling would be left to the whip's office, and Rubio would become the main spokesperson for the House GOP.[29]\nAccording to National Journal, during this period Rubio did not entirely adhere to doctrinaire conservative principles, and some colleagues described him as a centrist \"who sought out Democrats and groups that don't typically align with the GOP\".[29] He co-sponsored legislation that would have let farmworkers sue growers in state court if they were shortchanged on pay, and co-sponsored a bill for giving in-state tuition rates to the children of undocumented immigrants.[29] In the wake of the September 11 attacks, he voiced suspicion about expanding police detention powers and helped defeat a GOP bill that would have required colleges to increase reporting to the state about foreign students.[29]\nAs a state representative, Rubio requested legislative earmarks (called \"Community Budget Issue Requests\" in Florida), totaling about $145\u00a0million for 2001 and 2002, but none thereafter.[41][42] Additionally, an office in the executive branch compiled a longer list of spending requests by legislators, including Rubio,[43] as did the non-profit group Florida TaxWatch.[44] Many of those listed items were for health and social programs that Rubio has described as \"the kind of thing that legislators would get attacked on if we didn't fund them\".[44] A 2010 report by the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald said that some of Rubio's spending requests dovetailed with his personal interests.[43] For example, Rubio requested a $20\u00a0million appropriation for Jackson Memorial Hospital to subsidize care for the poor and uninsured,[44] and Rubio later did work for that hospital as a consultant.[43] A spokesman for Rubio has said that the items in question helped the whole county, that Rubio did not lobby to get them approved, that the hospital money was necessary and non-controversial, and that Rubio is \"a limited-government conservative\u00a0... not a no-government conservative\".[43]\n\nHouse speaker\nThen Speaker-Designate Rubio challenging Florida House colleagues to help write 100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future in September 2005\nRubio as Chairman of the Florida House Select Committee on Private Property Rights in October 2005\nRubio with Democratic leader Dan Gelber in 2007\nFlorida House Speaker Rubio and Senate President Ken Pruitt embrace after the Florida House's unanimous approval of the Florida Senate's resolution to formally express deep regret for slavery in March 2008\nOn September 13, 2005, at age 34,[45] Rubio became speaker after State Representatives Dennis Baxley, Jeff Kottkamp, and Dennis A. Ross dropped out. He was sworn in a year later, in November 2006. He became the first Cuban American to be speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, and would remain speaker until November 2008.[46]\nWhen he was chosen as future speaker in 2005, Rubio delivered a speech to the Florida House in which he asked members to look in their desks, where they each found a hardcover book titled 100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future; but the book was blank because it had not yet been written, and Rubio told his colleagues that they would fill in the pages together with the help of ordinary Floridians.[29] In 2006, after traveling around the state and talking with citizens, and compiling their ideas, Rubio published the book.[47][48] The National Journal called this book \"the centerpiece of Rubio's early speakership\".[29] About 24 of the \"ideas\" became law, while another 10 were partially enacted.[48] Among the items from his 2006 book that became law were multiple-year car registrations, a requirement that high schools provide more vocational courses, and an expanded voucher-like school-choice program. Rubio's defenders, and some critics, point out that nationwide economic difficulties overlapped with much of Rubio's speakership, and so funding new legislative proposals became difficult.[29]\nAs Rubio took office as Speaker, Jeb Bush was completing his term as governor, and Bush left office in January 2007. Rubio hired 18 Bush aides, leading capitol insiders to say the speaker's suite was \"the governor's office in exile\". An article in National Journal described Rubio's style as being very different from Bush's; where Bush was a very assertive manager of affairs in Tallahassee, Rubio's style was to delegate certain powers, relinquish others, and invite political rivals into his inner circle.[29] As the incoming speaker, he decided to open a private dining room for legislators, which he said would give members more privacy, free from being pursued by lobbyists, though the expense led to a public relations problem.[29]\nIn 2006, Florida enacted into law limitations upon the authority of the state government to take private property, in response to the 2005 Supreme Court decision in Kelo v. City of New London which took a broad view of governmental power to take private property under eminent domain. This state legislation had been proposed by a special committee chaired by Rubio prior to his speakership.[49]\nJeb Bush was succeeded by Charlie Crist, a moderate Republican who took office in January 2007. Rubio and Crist clashed frequently. Their sharpest clash involved the governor's initiative to expand casino gambling in Florida. Rubio sued Crist for bypassing the Florida Legislature in order to make a deal with the Seminole Tribe. The Florida Supreme Court sided with Rubio and blocked the deal.[50][51]\nRubio also was a critic of Crist's strategy to fight climate change through an executive order creating new automobile and utility emissions standards. Rubio accused Crist of imposing \"European-style big government mandates\", and the legislature under Rubio's leadership weakened the impact of Crist's climate change initiative.[29][51] Rubio said that Crist's approach would harm consumers by driving up utility bills without having much effect upon the environment, and that a better approach would be to promote biofuel (e.g. ethanol), solar panels, and energy efficiency.[52][53][54]\nRubio introduced a plan to reduce state property taxes to 2001 levels (and potentially eliminate them altogether), while increasing sales taxes by 1% to 2.5% to fund schools. The proposal would have reduced property taxes in the state by $40\u201350\u00a0billion. His proposal passed the House, but was opposed by Governor Crist and Florida Senate Republicans, who said that the increase in sales tax would disproportionately affect the poor. So, Rubio agreed to smaller changes, and Crist's proposal to double the state's property tax exemption from $25,000 to $50,000 (for a tax reduction estimated by Crist to be $33\u00a0billion) ultimately passed.[29][49][55] Legislators called it the largest tax cut in Florida's history up until then.[49][56] At the time, Republican anti-tax activist Grover Norquist described Rubio as \"the most pro-taxpayer legislative leader in the country\".[55]\nAs Speaker, Rubio \"aggressively tried to push Florida to the political right\", according to NBC News, and frequently clashed with the Florida Senate, which was run by more moderate Republicans, and with then-Governor Charlie Crist, a centrist Republican at the time.[51] Although a conservative, \"behind the scenes many Democrats considered Rubio someone with whom they could work,\" according to biographer Manuel Roig-Franzia.[57] Dan Gelber of Miami, the House Democratic leader at the time of Rubio's speakership, considered him \"a true conservative\" but not \"a reflexive partisan\", saying: \"He didn't have an objection to working with the other side simply because they were the other side. To put it bluntly, he wasn't a jerk.\"[58] Gelber considered Rubio \"a severe conservative, really far to the right, but probably the most talented spokesman the severe right could ever hope for.\"[51]\nWhile speaker of the Florida House, Rubio shared a residence in Tallahassee with another Florida State Representative, David Rivera, which the two co-owned. The house later went into foreclosure in 2010 after several missed mortgage payments.[59] At that point, Rubio assumed responsibility for the payments, and the house was eventually sold.[60][61]\nIn 2007, Florida state senator Tony Hill (D-Jacksonville), chairman of the state legislature's Black Caucus, requested that the legislature apologize for slavery, and Rubio said the idea merited discussion.[62] The following year, a supportive Rubio said such apologies can be important albeit symbolic; he pointed out that even in 2008 young African-American males \"believe that the American dream is not available to them\".[63][64] He helped set up a council on issues facing black men and boys, persuaded colleagues to replicate the Harlem Children's Zone in the Miami neighborhood of Liberty City, and supported efforts to promote literacy and mentoring for black children and others.[65][66][67][68]\nIn 2010 during Rubio's Senate campaign, and again in 2015 during his presidential campaign, issues were raised by the media and his political opponents about some items charged by Rubio to his Republican Party of Florida American Express card during his time as House speaker.[69][70][71] Rubio charged about $110,000 during those two years, of which $16,000 was personal expenses unrelated to party business, such as groceries and plane tickets.[72] Rubio said that he personally paid American Express more than $16,000 for these personal expenses.[73][74] In 2012, the Florida Commission on Ethics cleared Rubio of wrongdoing in his use of the party-issued credit card, although the commission inspector said that Rubio exhibited a \"level of negligence\" in not using his personal MasterCard.[75][76] In November 2015, Rubio released his party credit card statements for January 2005 through October 2006, which showed eight personal charges totaling $7,243.74, all of which he had personally reimbursed, in most instances by the next billing period.[71][72][77] When releasing the charge records, Rubio spokesman Todd Harris said, \"These statements are more than 10 years old. And the only people who ask about them today are the liberal media and our political opponents. We are releasing them now because Marco has nothing to hide.\"[71]\n\nProfessorship\nAfter leaving the Florida Legislature in 2008, Rubio began teaching under a fellowship appointment at Florida International University (FIU) as an adjunct professor.[78] In 2011, after entering the U.S. Senate, he rejoined the FIU faculty.[78][79] Rubio teaches in the Department of Politics and International Relations, which is part of FIU's Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs.[80] He has taught undergraduate courses on Florida politics, political parties, and legislative politics.[81][82]\nRubio's appointment as an FIU professor was initially criticized.[83][78][84] The university obtained considerable state funding when Rubio was speaker of the Florida House, and many other university jobs were being eliminated due to funding issues at the time FIU appointed him to the faculty.[78][81][84] When Rubio accepted the fellowship appointment as an adjunct professor at FIU, he agreed to raise most of the funding for his position from private sources.[84][85]\n\nU.S. Senate\nStart of Rubio's official welcome message at his U.S. Senate website\nElections\n2010\nMain article: 2010 United States Senate election in Florida\nOn May 5, 2009, Rubio stated his intent to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Mel Mart\u00ednez, who had decided not to seek reelection and subsequently resigned before completing his term. Before launching his campaign, Rubio met with fundraisers and supporters throughout the state.[86] Initially trailing by double digits in the primary against the incumbent governor of his own party, Charlie Crist, Rubio eventually surpassed Crist in polling for the Republican nomination.[87][88] In his campaign, Rubio received the support of members of the Tea Party, many of whom were dissatisfied with Crist's policies as governor.[89] On April 28, 2010, Crist said he would run without a party affiliation, effectively ceding the Republican nomination to Rubio.[90][91][92] Several of Crist's top fundraisers, as well as Republican leadership, refused to support Crist after Rubio won the Republican nomination.[93][94][95]\nOn November 2, 2010, Rubio won the general election with 49% of the vote to Crist's 30% and Democrat Kendrick Meek's 20%.[96] When Rubio was sworn in to the U.S. Senate, he and Bob Menendez of New Jersey were the only two Latino Americans in the Senate.\n\n2016\nMain article: 2016 United States Senate election in Florida\nIn April 2015, Rubio decided to run for president instead of seeking reelection to the Senate. After suspending his presidential campaign on March 15, 2016, Rubio \"seemed to open the door to running for reelection\" on June 13, 2016, citing the previous day's Orlando nightclub shooting and how \"it really gives you pause, to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country.\"[97] Rubio officially started his campaign nine days later, on June 22.[98] Rubio won the Republican primary on August 30, 2016, defeating Carlos Beruff.[99] He faced Democratic nominee Patrick Murphy in the general election, defeating him with almost 52% of the vote.[100]\n\n2022\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in Florida\nIn November 2020, Rubio announced he would run for a third Senate term in the 2022 election.[101] He faced Democratic challenger Val Demings, the U.S. Representative for Florida's 10th congressional district and a former police officer. Rubio criticized Demings as an \"ineffective member of Congress and a puppet of Nancy Pelosi; she's voted with Nancy Pelosi 100% of the time\".[102] Demings criticized Rubio's attendance record in the Senate, and in a campaign ad said Rubio had \"one of the worst attendance records in the Senate. When Florida needs you, you just don't show up.\"[103] Demings also claimed that Rubio supported tax hikes, but this was proven false.[104] Rubio won the November 8 general election with 57% of the vote to Demings's 41%.[105]\n\nTenure as senator\nRubio with Israeli President Shimon Peres during trip to Jordan and Israel in February 2013\nRubio touring the U.S.-Mexican border in November 2011 with Border Patrol officials\nDuring Rubio's first four years in the U.S. Senate, Republicans were in the minority. After the 2014 midterm elections, the Republicans obtained majority control of the Senate, giving Rubio and the Republicans vast federal influence during the final two years of Barack Obama's presidency, as well as during all four years of Donald Trump's presidency. After the 2020 elections, the Democrats regained majority control of the Senate, and Rubio has reassumed minority status within the Senate.\n\n112th Congress (2011\u20132013)\nRubio with Floridians at Camp Leatherneck in Afghanistan in January 2011Rubio visiting Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in May 2012\nShortly after taking office in 2011, Rubio said he had no interest in running for president or vice president in the 2012 presidential election.[106] In March 2012, when he endorsed Mitt Romney for president, Rubio said that he did not expect to be or want to be selected as a vice presidential running mate,[107] but was vetted for vice president by the Romney campaign.[107] Former Romney aide Beth Myers has said that the vetting process turned up nothing disqualifying about Rubio.[108]\nUpon taking office, Rubio hired Cesar Conda as his chief of staff.[109][110][111] Conda, a former adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, and former top aide to Sens. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) and Robert Kasten (R-Wis.), was succeeded in 2014 as Rubio's chief of staff by his deputy, Alberto Martinez, but Conda remained as a part-time adviser.[112]\nDuring his first year in office, Rubio became an influential defender of the United States embargo against Cuba and induced the State Department to withdraw an ambassadorial nomination of Jonathan D. Farrar, who was the Chief of Mission of the United States Interests Section in Havana from 2008 to 2011. Rubio believed that Farrar was not assertive enough toward the Castro regime.[113] Also in 2011, Rubio was invited to visit the Reagan Library, during which he gave a well-publicized speech praising its namesake, and also rescued Nancy Reagan from falling.[114][115]\nIn March 2011, Rubio supported U.S. participation in the military campaign in Libya to oust Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.[116] He urged that Senate leaders bring \"a bi-partisan resolution to the Senate floor authorizing the president's decision to participate in allied military action in Libya\".[117] The administration decided that no congressional authorization was needed under the War Powers Resolution; Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) joined Rubio in writing an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal in June 2011 again urging passage of such authorization.[118] In October 2011, Rubio joined several other senators in pushing for continued engagement to \"help Libya lay the foundation for sustainable security\".[119] Soon after Gadhafi was ousted, Rubio warned there was a serious threat posed by the spread of militias and weapons, and called for more U.S. involvement to counter that threat.[116]\nRubio voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011, which included mandatory automatic budget cuts from sequestration.[120][121] He later said that defense spending should never have been linked to taxes and the deficit, calling the policy a \"terrible idea\" based on a \"false choice\".[120]\nThe following month, Rubio and Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, co-sponsored the American Growth, Recovery, Empowerment and Entrepreneurship Act (AGREE Act), which would have extended many tax credits and exemptions for businesses investing in research and development, equipment, and other capital; provided a tax credit for veterans who start a business franchise; allowed an increase in immigration for certain types of work visas; and strengthened copyright protections.[122][123][124][125]\nRubio voted against the 2012 \"fiscal cliff\" resolutions. Although he received some criticism for this position, he responded: \"Thousands of small businesses, not just the wealthy, will now be forced to decide how they'll pay this new tax, and, chances are, they'll do it by firing employees, cutting back their hours and benefits, or postponing the new hires they were looking to make. And to make matters worse, it does nothing to bring our dangerous debt under control.\"[126]\n\n113th Congress (2013\u20132015)\nRubio prior to delivering the response to the State of the Union address in February 2013\nIn 2013, Rubio was part of the bipartisan \"Gang of Eight\" senators that crafted comprehensive immigration reform legislation.[127] Rubio proposed a plan providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States involving payment of fines and back taxes, background checks, and a probationary period; that pathway was to be implemented only after strengthening border security.[128][129] The bill passed the Senate 68 to 32 with his support, but Rubio then signaled that the bill should not be taken up by the House because other priorities, like repealing Obamacare, were a higher priority for him; the House never did take up the bill. Rubio has since explained that he still supports reform, but a different approach instead of a single comprehensive bill.[130]\nRubio was chosen to deliver the Republican response to President Obama's 2013 State of the Union Address.[131] It marked the first time the response was delivered in English and Spanish.[132] Rubio's attempt to draw a strong line against the looming defense sequestration was undercut by fellow Republican senator Rand Paul's additional response to Obama's speech that called for the sequester to be carried out.[133]\nIn April 2013, Rubio voted against an expansion of background checks for gun purchases, contending that such increased regulatory measures would do little to help capture criminals.[134][135]\nRubio voted against publishing the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture. In 2016, Rubio said the U.S. should \"find out everything they know\" from captured terrorists and should not telegraph \"the enemy what interrogation techniques we will or won't use.\"[136]\n\n114th Congress (2015\u20132017)\nRubio in November 2015\nRepublicans took control of the U.S. Senate as a result of the elections in November 2014.[137] As this new period of Republican control began, Rubio pushed for the elimination of the \"risk corridors\" used by the federal government to compensate insurers for their losses as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The risk corridors were intended to be funded by profitable insurers participating in the PPACA, but since insurer losses have significantly exceeded their profits in the program, the risk corridors have been depleted. His efforts contributed to the inclusion of a provision in the 2014 federal budget that prevented other funding sources from being tapped to replenish the risk corridors.[138]\nIn March 2015, Rubio and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, proposed a tax plan that according to The Wall Street Journal, combined thinking from \"old-fashioned, Reagan-era supply-siders\" and a \"breed of largely younger conservative reform thinkers\" concerned with the tax burden on the middle class. The plan would lower the top corporate income tax rate from 38% to 25%, eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends, and inherited estates, and create a new child tax credit worth up to $2,500 per child. The plan would set the top individual income tax rate at 35%. It also included a proposal to replace the means-tested welfare system, including food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit, with a new \"consolidated system of benefits\".[139]\nAccording to analysis by Vocativ as reported by Fox News, Rubio missed 8.3% of total votes from January 2011 to February 2015.[140] From October 27, 2014, to October 26, 2015, Rubio voted in 74% of Senate votes, according to an analysis by GovTrack.us, which tracks congressional voting records.[141][142] In 2015, Rubio was absent for about 35% of Senate votes.[141][143] In historical context Rubio's attendance record for Senate votes is not exceptional among senators seeking a presidential nomination; John McCain missed a much higher percentage of votes in 2007. But it was the worst of the three senators who campaigned for the presidency in 2015.[144]\nDuring his Senate tenure, Rubio has co-sponsored bills on issues ranging from humanitarian crises in Haiti to the Russian incursion into Ukraine,[145] and was a frequent and prominent critic of Obama's efforts in national security.[145]\nOn May 17, 2016, Rubio broke from the Republican majority in his support of Obama's request for $2 billion in emergency spending on the Zika virus at a time when Florida accounted for roughly 20% of the recorded cases of Zika in the U.S., acknowledging that it was the president's request but adding, \"it's really the scientists' request, the doctors' request, the public health sector's request for how to address this issue.\"[146] On August 6, Rubio said he did not believe in terminating Zika-infected pregnancies.[147]\nOn December 13, after President-elect Trump nominated Rex Tillerson as his Secretary of State in the incoming administration, Rubio expressed concern about the selection.[148] On January 11, Rubio questioned Tillerson during a Senate committee hearing on his confirmation, saying afterward he would \"do what's right\".[149] On January 23, Rubio said that he would vote to confirm Tillerson, saying that a delay in the appointment would be counter to national interests.[150]\n\n115th Congress (2017\u20132019)\nPresident Donald Trump (left) with FEMA administrator Brock Long (center) and Rubio in September 2017\nOn April 5, 2017, Rubio said Bashar al-Assad felt he could act with \"impunity\" in knowing the United States was not prioritizing removing him from office.[151] The next day, Rubio praised Trump's ordered strike: \"By acting decisively against the very facility from which Assad launched his murderous chemical weapons attack, President Trump has made it clear to Assad and those who empower him that the days of committing war crimes with impunity are over.\"[152]\nIn September 2017, Rubio defended Trump's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He called the program, which provided temporary stay for some undocumented immigrants brought into the U.S. as minors, \"unconstitutional\".[153]\nIn the first session of the 115th United States Congress, Rubio was ranked the tenth most bipartisan senator by the Bipartisan Index, published by The Lugar Center and Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy.[154]\nWhile ballots were being counted in a close Florida Senate race between Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson and Republican challenger Rick Scott, Rubio claimed without evidence that Democrats were conspiring with election officials to illicitly install Nelson.[155][156][157] He claimed without evidence that \"Democrat lawyers\" were descending on Florida and that \"they have been very clear they aren't here to make sure every vote is counted.\"[155] He claimed that Broward County officials were engaged in \"ongoing\" legal violations, without specifying what those were.[155] Election monitors found no evidence of voter fraud in Broward County, and the Florida State Department found no evidence of criminal activity.[157]\n\n116th Congress (2019\u20132021)\nRubio meeting with Venezuelan presidential candidate and opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 in February 2020\nIn 2019, Rubio defended Trump's decision to host the 46th G7 summit at the Trump National Doral Miami, a resort Trump owns. Rubio called the decision \"great\" and said it would be good for local businesses.[158][159]\nIn 2020, Rubio supported the nomination of Judy Shelton to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Shelton had received bipartisan criticism over her support for the gold standard and other unorthodox monetary policy views.[160][161]\nAfter Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 presidential election and Trump made false claims of election fraud, Rubio defended Trump's right to assert claims of fraud and challenge the election results, saying any \"irregularities\" and \"claims of broken election laws\" could not be claimed false until the courts ruled on them. Rubio later shifted his rhetoric to saying that concerns from Republican voters over \"potential irregularities\" in the election demanded redress. By November 23, 2020, Rubio referred to Biden as president-elect.[162]\n\n117th Congress (2021\u20132023)\nRubio described the 2021 United States Capitol attack as unpatriotic and \"3rd world-style anti-American anarchy\".[163] Of the rioters, Rubio said some of them were adherents \"to a conspiracy theory and others got caught up in the moment. The result was a national embarrassment.\" After Congress was allowed to return to session, Rubio voted to certify the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.[164] In February 2021, Rubio voted to acquit Trump for his role in inciting the mob to storm the Capitol.[165]\nOn May 28, 2021, Rubio voted against creating the January 6 commission.[166]\nIn May 2021, Rubio argued that \"Wall Street must stop enabling Communist China\" in The American Prospect[167] and on his website.[168] \"Americans from across the political spectrum should feel emboldened by the growing bipartisan awakening to the threat that the CCP poses to American workers, families, and communities\", he wrote. \"As we deploy legislative solutions to tackle this challenge, Democrats must not allow our corporate and financial sectors' leftward shift on social issues to blind them to the enormity of China as a geo-economic threat.\"[167]\nRubio denounced the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and co-sponsored a bill that would target pro-Russian separatist groups whose conflict with the Ukrainian government was used by Vladimir Putin to justify the invasion.[169]\n\nCommittee assignments\nRubio's committee memberships are as follows:[170]\n\nCommittee on Appropriations\nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\nSelect Committee on Intelligence (Ranking Member)\nCommittee on Foreign Relations\nSubcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women's Issues (Ranking Member)\nSubcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy\nSubcommittee on State Department and USAID Management, International Operations, and Bilateral International Development\nSpecial Committee on Aging\nCaucuses\nSenate Republican Conference\n2016 presidential campaign\nMain article: Marco Rubio 2016 presidential campaign\nFurther information: 2016 United States presidential election\nRubio speaks at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland\nRubio said in April 2014 that he would not run for reelection to the Senate if he ran for president in 2016, as Florida law prohibits a candidate from appearing twice on a ballot, but at that time he did not rule out running for either office.[171] He later indicated that even if he would not win the Republican nomination for president, he would not run for reelection to the Senate.[172] Also in April 2014, the departure of Cesar Conda, Rubio's chief of staff since 2011, was seen as a sign of Rubio's plans to run for president in 2016. Conda departed to lead Rubio's Reclaim America PAC as a senior adviser.[173][174] Groups supporting Rubio raised over $530,000 in the first three months of 2014, most of which was spent on consultants and data analytics, in what was seen as preparations for a presidential campaign.[175]\nA poll from the WMUR/University, tracking New Hampshire's Republican primary voters' sentiment, showed Rubio at the top alongside Kentucky senator Rand Paul later in 2013, but as of April 18, 2014, he had dropped to 10th place behind other Republican contenders. The poll, however, also suggested that Rubio was not disliked by the primary voters, which was thought to be positive for him if other candidates had chosen not to run.[176] Rubio placed second among potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates in an online poll of likely voters conducted by Zogby Analytics in January 2015.[177]\nIn January 2015, it was reported that Rubio had begun contacting top donors and appointing advisors for a potential 2016 run, including George Seay, who previously worked on such campaigns as Rick Perry's in 2012 and Mitt Romney's in 2008, and Jim Rubright, who had previously worked for Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain.[178][179] Rubio also instructed his aides to \"prepare for a presidential campaign\" prior to a Team Marco 2016 fundraising meeting in South Beach.[180]\nOn April 13, 2015, Rubio launched his campaign for president in 2016.[181] Rubio was believed to be a viable candidate for the 2016 presidential race who could attract many parts of the GOP base, partly because of his youthfulness and oratorical skill.[182][183] Rubio had pitched his candidacy as an effort to restore the American Dream for middle and working-class families, who might have found his background as a working-class Cuban-American appealing.[184]\n\nRepublican primaries\nIn the first Republican primary, the February\u00a01 Iowa caucuses, Rubio finished third, behind candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.[185] During a nationally televised debate among Republican candidates in New Hampshire on February 6, 2016, Rubio was criticized by rival Chris Christie for speaking repetitiously, with Christie saying Rubio sounded \"scripted\". On February 9, when he placed fifth in the New Hampshire primary results, Rubio took the blame and acknowledged a poor debate performance.[186] In the third Republican contest, the South Carolina primary on February 20, Rubio finished second, but did not gain any delegates as Trump won all of South Carolina's congressional districts and thus delegates.[187][188] Jeb Bush left the race that day, leading to a surge in campaign donations and endorsements to Rubio. On February 23, Rubio finished second in the Nevada caucuses, again losing to Trump.[189] Trump called Rubio's remarks at the February 25 debate \"robotic\" due to Rubio's repeated use of the same talking points; Rubio was later followed by hecklers who were dressed as robots.[190]\nAt another Republican debate on February 25, Rubio repeatedly criticized frontrunner candidate Donald Trump.[191] It was described by CNN as a \"turning point in style\" as Rubio had previously largely ignored Trump during his campaign, and this deviated from Rubio's signature \"optimistic campaign message\". The next day Rubio continued turning Trump's attacks against him,[192] even ridiculing Trump's physical appearance.[193] On March 1, called 'Super Tuesday' with eleven Republican contests on that day, Rubio's sole victory was in Minnesota, the first state he had won since voting began a month prior.[188] Rubio went on to win further contests in Puerto Rico on March\u00a06 and the District of Columbia on March 12, but lost eight other contests from March\u00a05 to 8.[188] Around that time, Rubio revealed he was not \"entirely proud\" of his personal attacks on Trump.[194]\nOn March 15, Rubio suspended his campaign after placing second in his own home state of Florida.[193] Hours earlier, Rubio had expressed expectations for a Florida win, and said he would continue to campaign (in Utah) \"irrespective of\" that night's results.[195] The result was that Rubio won 27.0% of the Florida vote, while Trump won 45.7% and all of Florida's delegates.[196] The conclusion of the six March 15 contests (out of which Rubio won none) left Rubio with 169 delegates on the race to reach 1237, but Ted Cruz already had 411 and Trump 673.[188][197] On March 17, Rubio ruled out runs for the vice-presidency, governorship of Florida and even reelection for his senate seat. He said only that he would be a \"private citizen\" by January 2017, leading to some media speculation of the termination of his political career.[198]\n\nAfter candidacy\nRubio with Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen in June 2016\nRubio and President Trump (left) visit a fourth-grade classroom in Orlando, Florida on March 3, 2017\nOn April 12, during an interview with Mark Levin, Rubio expressed his wishes that Republicans would nominate a conservative candidate, name-dropping Cruz.[199] This was interpreted as an endorsement of Cruz, though Rubio clarified the following day that he had only been answering a question.[200] Rubio would later explain his decision to not endorse Cruz being due to his belief that the endorsement would not significantly benefit him and a desire to let the election cycle play out.[201] On April 22, Rubio said he was not interested in being the vice presidential candidate to any of the remaining GOP contenders.[202] On May 16, Rubio posted several tweets in which he critiqued sources reporting that he despised the Senate and a Washington Post story that claimed he was unsure of his next move after his unsuccessful presidential bid, typing, \"I have only said like 10000 times I will be a private citizen in January.\"[203]\nOn May 18, after Trump expressed a willingness to meet with Kim Jong-un, Rubio said Kim was \"not a stable person\" and furthered that Trump was open to the meeting only due to inexperience with the North Korea leader.[204] On May 26, Rubio told reporters that he was backing Trump due to his view that the presumptive nominee was a better choice than Hillary Clinton for the presidency and that as president, Trump would sign a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and replace the late Antonin Scalia with another conservative Supreme Court Justice.[205] He also confirmed that he would be attending the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, where he intended to release his pledged delegates to support Trump.[206] On May 29, Rubio continued disavowing vice presidential speculation but indicated an interest in playing a role in Trump's campaign.[207] On June 6, Rubio rebuked Trump's comments on Gonzalo P. Curiel, who Trump accused of being biased against him on the basis of his ethnicity, as \"offensive\" while speaking with reporters, advising that Trump should cease defending the remarks and defending the judge as \"an American\".[208]\nOn July 6, Olivia Perez-Cubas, Rubio's Senate campaign spokeswoman, said he would not be attending the Republican National Convention due to planned campaigning on the days the convention was scheduled to take place.[209]\nDuring the Republican primary campaign in which Rubio and Donald Trump were opponents, Rubio criticized Trump,[210] including, in February 2016, calling Trump a \"con artist\" and saying that Trump is \"wholly unprepared to be president of the United States\".[211] In June 2016, after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee, Rubio reaffirmed his February 2016 comments that we must not hand \"the nuclear codes of the United States to an erratic individual\".[212] However, after Trump won the Republican Party's nomination, Rubio endorsed him on July 20, 2016.[213] Following the October 7, 2016, Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy, Rubio wrote that \"Donald's comments were vulgar, egregious & impossible to justify. No one should ever talk about any woman in those terms, even in private.\"[214] Rubio reaffirmed his support of Trump shortly thereafter.[215] Two weeks later, at the annual Calle Orange street festival in downtown Orlando, he was booed off a stage by a mostly Latino crowd over his support for Trump.[216]\n\nPolitical positions\nMain article: Political positions of Marco Rubio\nSenator Rubio speaks at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland\nRubio applauds Florida Governor Ron DeSantis during an event with the Venezuelan American community in February 2019\nAs of early 2015, Rubio had a rating of 98.67 by the American Conservative Union, based on his lifetime voting record in the Senate. According to the National Journal, in 2013 Rubio was the 17th most conservative senator.[217] The Club for Growth gave Rubio ratings of 93 percent and 91 percent based on his voting record in 2014 and 2013 respectively, and he has a lifetime rating from the organization above 90 percent.[218][219][220]\nRubio initially won his U.S. Senate seat with strong Tea Party backing, but his 2013 support for comprehensive immigration reform legislation led to a decline in their support for him.[221][222] Rubio's stance on military, foreign policy, and national security issues\u00a0\u2013 such as his support for arming the Syrian rebels and for the NSA\u00a0\u2013 alienated some libertarian Tea Party activists.[222][223]\nRubio supports balancing the federal budget, while prioritizing defense spending. He rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, which is that climate change is real, progressing, harmful, and primarily caused by humans, arguing that human activity does not play a major role and claiming that proposals to address climate change would be ineffective and economically harmful.[224][225][226] He opposes the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has voted to repeal it.[227] He opposes net neutrality, a policy that requires Internet service providers to treat data on the Internet the same regardless of its source or content. Early in his Senate tenure, Rubio was involved in bipartisan negotiations to provide a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants while implementing various measures to strengthen the U.S. border; the bill passed the Senate but was blocked by immigration hardliners in the House.[228] Over time, Rubio distanced himself from his previous efforts to reach a compromise on immigration,[229] and developed more hardline views on immigration, rejecting bipartisan immigration reform efforts in 2018.[230]\nRubio is an outspoken opponent of abortion.[231] He has said that he would ban it even in cases of rape and incest, but with exceptions if the mother's life is in danger.[231][232][233]\nRubio has expressed caution about efforts to reduce penalties for drug crimes, saying that \"too often\" the conversation about criminal justice reform \"starts and ends with drug policy\".[234] He has said that he would be open to legalizing non-psychoactive forms of cannabis for medical use, but otherwise opposes its legalization for recreational and medical purposes.[235][236] Rubio has said that if elected president he would enforce federal law in states that have legalized cannabis.[236][237]\n\nRubio with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in November 2011\nRubio supports setting corporate taxes at 25%, reforming the tax code, and capping economic regulations, and proposes to increase the social security retirement age based on longer life expectancy. He supports expanding public charter schools, opposes Common Core State Standards, and advocates closing the federal Department of Education.[238]\nRubio supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq and military intervention in Libya.[239] Rubio voiced support for a Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against Houthi rebels.[240] Regarding Iran, he supports tough sanctions, and scrapping the nuclear deal with Iran; regarding the Islamic State, he favors aiding local Sunni forces in Iraq and Syria.[241][242] Rubio says that, because background checks cannot be done under present circumstances, the United States cannot accept more Syrian refugees.[citation needed] He supports working with allies to set up no-fly zones in Syria to protect civilians from Bashar al-Assad. He favors collection of bulk metadata for purposes of national security.[citation needed] He has said that gun control laws consistently fail to achieve their purpose.[citation needed] He is supportive of the Trans Pacific Partnership, saying that the U.S. risks being excluded from global trade unless it is more open to trade. He is wary of China regarding national security and human rights, and wants to boost the U.S. military presence in that region but hopes for greater economic growth as a result of trading with that country. He also believes the U.S. should support democracy, freedom, and true autonomy of the people of Hong Kong.[243][244][245][246] On capital punishment, Rubio favors streamlining the appeals process.[242]\nRubio condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.[247] Rubio is a staunch supporter of Israel. He is a co-sponsor of a Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.[248] Rubio condemned Turkey's wide-ranging crackdown on dissent following a failed July 2016 coup.[249]\n\nRubio with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February 2013\nAt a February 2018 CNN town hall event in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Rubio defended his record of accepting contributions from the National Rifle Association (NRA), saying, \"The influence of these groups comes not from money. The influence comes from the millions of people that agree with the agenda, the millions of Americans that support the NRA.\"[250]\nIn March 2018, Rubio defended the decision of the Trump administration to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.[251] Experts noted that the inclusion of such a question would likely result in severe undercounting of the population and faulty data, as undocumented immigrants would be less likely to respond to the census.[251] Fellow Republican members of Congress from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, criticized the Trump administration's decision on the basis that it could lead to a faulty census and disadvantage Florida in terms of congressional apportionment and fund apportionment.[251]\nIn July 2018, Rubio offered an amendment to a major congressional spending bill to potentially force companies that purchase real estate in cash to disclose their owners as \"an attempt to root out criminals who use illicit funds and anonymous shell companies to buy homes\".[252]\nOn August 28, 2018, Rubio and 16 other members of Congress urged the United States to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials who are responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang.[253]\n\nRubio with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in March 2020\nRubio opposed the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"). On April 27, 2020, the US Supreme Court voted 8\u20131 to defeat his attempt to stop Obamacare.[254][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nIn March 2016, Rubio opposed President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, saying, \"I don't think we should be moving forward with a nominee in the last year of this president's term. I would say that even if it was a Republican president.\"[255] In September 2020, Rubio applauded Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the court after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death, voting to confirm her on October 26, 86 days before the expiration of Trump's presidential term.[256][257]\nRubio has a mixed relationship with Donald Trump.[258] During the Republican primaries in the 2016 presidential election, they harshly criticized each other.

Her district, numbered as the 2nd district in her first term, includes most of Iowa's southeastern quadrant, including Davenport, Bettendorf, Burlington, and Iowa City. A member of the Republican Party, Miller-Meeks served as Iowa state senator for the 41st district from 2019 to 2021.\nMiller-Meeks ran three unsuccessful campaigns for the U.S. House against Dave Loebsack. When Loebsack retired in 2020, she ran again and defeated Rita Hart by a margin of six votes. She was reelected in 2022 by a margin of nearly seven percentage points.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nMiller-Meeks was born in Herlong, California, in 1955.[1] She enlisted in the United States Army at the age of 18 and served for 24 years, including as a nurse, physician, and member of the United States Army Reserve. She retired at the rank of lieutenant colonel.\nA first-generation college student, Miller-Meeks earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from Texas Christian University, a Master of Science in education from the University of Southern California, and a Doctor of Medicine from University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.[2]\n\nEarly career[edit]\nMiller-Meeks operated a private ophthalmology practice in Ottumwa, Iowa, until 2008. She also served as the first female president of the Iowa Medical Society. She was the first woman on the faculty of the University of Iowa's department of ophthalmology and visual sciences, and worked as a representative from Iowa to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.[2] In 2010, Governor Terry Branstad appointed Miller-Meeks director of the Iowa Department of Public Health; she resigned in 2014 to run for Congress.[3][4]\n\nIowa State Senate (2019\u20132021)[edit]\nWhen Mark Chelgren announced he was not running for reelection, she ran for Iowa Senate, District 41 in 2018, defeating Democratic nominee Mary Stewart.[5] Her term in the Iowa Senate began January 14, 2019.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives[edit]\nElections[edit]\n2008, 2010, 2014[edit]\nSee also: 2008 United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa \u00a7\u00a0District 2\nMiller-Meeks was the Republican nominee for Iowa's 2nd congressional district in 2008, 2010 and 2014, losing to Dave Loebsack in all three races.\n\n2014[edit]\nSee also: 2014 United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa \u00a7\u00a0District 2\nIn her 2014 campaign, Miller-Meeks opposed the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).[1] She also stated her opposition to legalized abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or harm to the mother.[1] She opposed same-sex marriage.[1] She criticized EPA regulation of waterways and coal plants, saying it creates uncertainty for farmers.[1]\n\n2020[edit]\nSee also: 2020 United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa \u00a7\u00a0District 2\nMiller-Meeks ran to represent Iowa's 2nd congressional district again in 2020, following Loebsack's retirement.[6] She won the June 2 Republican primary election, defeating former Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, she said she \"practices social distancing, wears a mask in public and sanitizes her hands\" but does not support face mask mandates.[7]\nShe faced the Democratic nominee, former state senator Rita Hart, in the November general election.[8] After Loebsack announced his retirement, journalists and election forecasters labeled the 2nd congressional district a swing district. Miller-Meeks defeated Hart in the general election by six votes, making this the closest election in 2020 and flipping Iowa's 2nd Congressional District from Democratic to Republican control in one of the closest races in 100 years; the state certified the victory.[9][10] Hart contested the certified result through a petition with the Committee on House Administration under the 1969 Federal Contested Elections Act, which sets forth procedures for contesting state election results in the House under the Constitution.[11] Hart did not contest the election in Iowa's courts.[11][12][13] In her petition, Hart contended, without evidence, that 22 legally cast votes were not counted. Had they been counted, per her petition, she would have won the race by nine votes.[14][15]\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi provisionally seated Miller-Meeks on January 3, 2021, pending adjudication of Hart's petition.[14][16] The Committee on House Administration reviewed Hart's petition, and Pelosi claimed the House had the authority to expel Miller-Meeks,[17][18] but on March 31, Hart withdrew her challenge.[19]\nMiller-Meeks and Michelle Fischbach are the only Republican members of Congress to flip Democratic House districts that were not held by Republicans in the 115th Congress before 2018.\n\n2022[edit]\nSee also: 2022 United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa \u00a7\u00a0District 1\nMiller-Meeks ran for reelection, this time in Iowa's 1st congressional district, for the 2022 elections.[20] During redistricting, her home in Ottumwa was drawn into the neighboring 3rd district, but almost all of her former territory was drawn into the 1st, effectively trading district numbers with fellow Republican freshman Ashley Hinson. While members of the House are only required to live in the state they represent, Miller-Meeks moved to Le Claire, near Davenport. Miller-Meeks defeated Democratic nominee Christina Bohannan in the November 2022 general election.[21]\n\nTenure[edit]\nMiller-Meeks, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[22]\nOn May 19, 2021, Miller-Meeks was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6, 2021 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.[23]\n\nInfrastructure[edit]\nIn 2020, Miller-Meeks said that an infrastructure bill would be her main priority, suggesting a fuel tax increase to pay for it.[24]\nIn 2021, Miller-Meeks voted against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.[25]\n\nImmigration[edit]\nOn July 21, 2021, Miller-Meeks and Deborah Ross co-sponsored the America's CHILDREN Act.[26] The bill would prevent the children of long-term visa holders who came to the U.S. legally with their parents from having their visas expire the day they turn 21. If they have maintained legal status in the U.S. for 10 years and graduated from an institution of higher education, they are eligible to apply for permanent residency.[26]\n\nLGBT rights[edit]\nIn 2021, Miller Meeks was one of 29 Republicans to vote to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.[27] This bill expanded legal protections for transgender people, and contained provisions allowing transgender women to use women's shelters and serve time in prisons matching their gender identity rather than by biological sex.[28]\nOn July 19, 2022, Miller-Meeks and 46 other Republican representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.[29]\n\nAntitrust bill[edit]\nIn 2022, Meeks was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.[30][31]\n\nCommittee assignments[edit]\nFor the 118th Congress:[32]\n\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\nSubcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Minerals\nSubcommittee on Health\nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs\nSubcommittee on Health (Chairwoman)\nSelect Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic\nCaucus memberships[edit]\nPandemic Preparedness Caucus (co-chair)[33]\nPublic Schools Caucus (co-chair)[33]\nAluminum Caucus[33]\nArmy Caucus[33]\nBiofuels Caucus[33]\nBus Caucus[33]\nConservative Climate Caucus[33]\nFor Country Caucus[33]\nGeneral Aviation Caucus[33]\nGOP Doctors Caucus[33]\nGOP Healthy Futures Task Force[33]\nGrid Innovation Caucus[33]\nMental Health Caucus[33]\nMotorcycle Caucus[33]\nPro-Life Caucus[33]\nRural Broadband Caucus[33]\nSmall Business Caucus[33]\nSportsmen's Caucus[33]\nSteel Caucus[33]\nSuburban Caucus[33]\nTaiwan Caucus[33]\nTelehealth Caucus[33]\nWestern Caucus[33]\nWomen, Peace, and Security Caucus[33]\nPersonal life[edit]\nMiller-Meeks is a resident of Ottumwa, Iowa. She is married to Curt Meeks, the Compliance Officer at Ottumwa Regional Health Center, and has two children.[34][35] She is Roman Catholic.[1] Miller-Meeks organized a physician recruitment and retention organization to help bring physicians to southeast Iowa and has served as a court-appointed special advocate volunteer for children.[2]\n\nElectoral history[edit]\n2008[edit]\nMain article: 2008 United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa\n\n2008 Iowa's 2nd congressional district election\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nDave Loebsack (incumbent) \n\n175,218 \n\n57.19 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nMariannette Miller-Meeks\n\n118,778\n\n38.77\n\n\n\n\nGreen\n\nWendy Barth\n\n6,664\n\n2.18\n\n\n\n\nIndependent\n\nBrian White\n\n5,437\n\n1.78\n\n\n\n\nNo party\n\nOthers\n\n261\n\n0.09\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n306,358 \n\n100.00 \n\n\nTurnout\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic hold\n\n\n2010[edit]\nMain article: 2010 United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa\n\n2010 Iowa's 2nd congressional district election\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nDave Loebsack (incumbent)  \n\n115,839 \n\n50.99 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nMariannette Miller-Meeks\n\n104,319\n\n45.92\n\n\n\n\nLibertarian\n\nGary Joseph Sicard\n\n4,356\n\n1.92\n\n\n\n\nConstitution\n\nJon Tack\n\n2,463\n\n1.08\n\n\n\n\nNo party\n\nOthers\n\n198\n\n0.09\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n227,175 \n\n100.00 \n\n\nTurnout\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic hold\n\n\n2014[edit]\nMain article: 2014 United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa\n\n2014 Iowa's 2nd congressional district election\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nDave Loebsack (incumbent) \n\n143,431 \n\n52.48 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nMariannette Miller-Meeks\n\n129,455\n\n47.36\n\n\n\n\nWrite-ins\n\n\n\n443\n\n0.16\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n273,329 \n\n100 \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic hold\n\n\n2018[edit]\nMain article: 2018 Iowa Senate election\n\n2018 Iowa's 41st senate district primary elections[36]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nMariannette Miller-Meeks \n\n1,706 \n\n85.39 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDaniel Cesar\n\n279\n\n13.96\n\n\n\n\nWrite-ins\n\n\n\n13\n\n0.65\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n2,134 \n\n100 \n\n\n\n2018 Iowa's 41st senate district general election\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nMariannette Miller-Meeks \n\n11,451 \n\n51.77 \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nMary Stewart\n\n10,632\n\n48.07\n\n\n\n\nWrite-ins\n\n\n\n36\n\n0.16\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n22,119 \n\n100 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican hold\n\n\n2020[edit]\nMain article: 2020 United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa\n\nIowa's 2nd congressional district, 2020\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nMariannette Miller-Meeks \n\n196,964 \n\n49.912 \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nRita Hart\n\n196,958\n\n49.910\n\n\n\n\nWrite-ins\n\n\n\n703\n\n0.178\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n394,625 \n\n100.0 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican gain from Democratic\n\n\n2022[edit]\nMain article: 2022 United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa\n\nIowa's 2nd congressional district, 2020\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nMariannette Miller-Meeks \n\n160,441 \n\n53.3 \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nChristina Bohannan\n\n140,453\n\n46.6\n\n\n\n\nWrite-ins\n\n\n\n256\n\n0.1\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n301,150 \n\n100.0 \n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nIowa portal\nWomen in the United States House of Representatives\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f Jackson, Sharyn (October 12, 2014). \"Hot issues dominate 2nd District\".
