His works include the film Who's the Caboose? (1997) as well as the television shows Beat Cops (2001) and Pilot Season (2004). He also appeared in Next Stop Wonderland (1998) and made guest appearances on Spin City (1997), Sex and the City (2000), America Undercover (2005), and Maron (2015). Since 2010, he has hosted a daily political talk show, The Majority Report with Sam Seder. He also voices Hugo, a recurring character on the animated comedy series Bob's Burgers.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nSeder was born to a Jewish family in New York City, and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, and is the oldest of three children.[3][4] His father, J. Robert Seder, is a well-known lawyer in Worcester. Seder earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Religious Studies from Connecticut College and enrolled at Boston University School of Law. He later dropped out to pursue a career in comedy.[4]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn March 2004, Seder became co-host of Air America Radio's The Majority Report alongside Janeane Garofalo.[5]\nDuring Mark Green's restructuring plan to transform Air America into a profitable leader in progressive talk radio, called \"Air America 2.0\",[6] The Sam Seder Show was canceled on April 13, 2007, and replaced by WOR Radio Network late night radio show host Lionel.[7] Seder was relegated to a Sunday show entitled Seder on Sunday.[6] Lionel soon lost two-thirds of Seder's live affiliates and listenership.[8] The final Seder on Sunday was broadcast on June 1, 2008.[citation needed]\nSeder also occasionally substituted for Randi Rhodes when Rhodes was on Air America, as well as Mike Malloy on The Mike Malloy Show on the Nova M Radio network. In 2008 he also began a collaboration with Marc Maron on Maron v. Seder, an hour-long video webcast. In January 2009, Maron v. Seder was renamed Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder[9] and aired live from the kitchen in the Air America offices weekdays. Seder and Maron also hosted a post-show chat with viewers after each episode. Air America Media cancelled Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder in July 2009.[10] In 2010, Air America was shut down.[11]\nIn November 2009, Seder hosted a pilot for NBC of an American version of Have I Got News for You. Three years later, in November 2012, it was announced Seder would again be the host of an American version of the show, this time on TBS.[12][13]\nIn November 2010, Seder began an independent online podcast, called The Seder Channel (later renamed The Majority Report w/Sam Seder). The live talk-show format closely matches the previous Air America program, with politically oriented commentary by Seder and co-hosts, and interviews with various guests. Seder offers listeners different tiered levels of access to content around the show via crowdfunding platform Patreon.\nIn late 2010, Seder began occasionally serving as substitute host of Countdown with Keith Olbermann when Olbermann was on vacation. In December 2010, Seder also became co-host of the nationally syndicated progressive radio interview program Ring of Fire, co-hosted by Farron Cousins and Florida-based attorney Mike Papantonio.[14]\nSeder also worked as a political contributor for MSNBC.[15][16]\n\n2004 Republican National Convention[edit]\nOn September 1, 2004, Seder was briefly detained by the United States Secret Service during his live, on-site coverage of that year's Republican National Convention at Madison Square Garden. Shortly after Zell Miller gave his speech, Seder began searching (with a sign in hand) on the convention floor for a willing homosexual Republican to interview live on radio. Shortly thereafter, he was physically removed from the floor and, after brief questioning, asked to leave the convention. Seder later commented that his wearing of a lapel pin that he had been given by a Secret Service agent at the Democratic National Convention earlier that year had kept him from being ejected from the convention completely.[17]\n\n2017 MSNBC controversy[edit]\nThis section may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience. Please help by spinning off or relocating any relevant information, and removing excessive detail that may be against Wikipedia's inclusion policy. (April 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\n\n\nI believe this tweet was posted when Polanski was seeking to return to the US. I wrote that tweet out of disgust with those who were excusing or were seeking to advocate forgiveness for Polanski's actions which caused him to flee the US. I was appalled that anyone would diminish the seriousness of rape, particularly of a child by citing the perpetrator's artistic contributions. Obviously, I would not wish any harm of my daughter or any other person.I am confident that other tweets from that time will reflect my disgust in a less satirical tone.\n\n\n\u2014Sam Seder in an email to MSNBC Senior VP of Communications Errol Cockfield Jr., defending the tweet.[18]\n\n\nOn November 28, 2017, American social media personality Mike Cernovich published a post on Medium[19] that resurfaced a deleted tweet Seder wrote in 2009 joking about convicted statutory rapist and fugitive film director Roman Polanski.[16][20] The tweet read, \"Don't care re Polanski, but I hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/ a great sense of mise en scene.\"[19][20] Cernovich insisted the tweet proved Seder tacitly endorsed Polanski's sex crime.[19][18] He then approached multiple journalists and news outlets, including MSNBC, to break the story.[15][21] MSNBC Senior Vice President of Communications Errol Cockfield Jr. asked Seder that night to explain the tweet. Seder replied to Cockfield in an email explaining the point being made in the tweet and the context in which he wrote it. Seder also provided other tweets supporting his claim.[15][18]\nThe next day, Seder received a voicemail from Cockfield indicating MSNBC's upper management was seriously considering cutting ties with him. Seder responded that MSNBC was making a mistake and that, \"there's no story here.\" Seder further warned Cockfield that if they moved forward with the termination, \"You guys are going to be the story.\" Seder also requested a formal termination email. Seder never received the email, leading him to believe that this employment status was still undecided.[15][18] On December 3, Seder was notified by Jon Levine of TheWrap that they had been contacted by MSNBC who had decided to terminate Seder's contract and were about to break the story through their own publication. Seder immediately sent Cockfield an inquiry regarding his status. Cockfield, at first, did not have a status update but later confirmed MSNBC was, in fact, dropping Seder.[15][18]\n\nFiring[edit]\nThe next day, TheWrap announced that MSNBC had severed ties with Seder by not renewing his contract because of the controversial tweet.[15][16][18] Seder defended the tweet by pointing out that, taken in context of the current events around the time he posted it, it was a satiric response to a petition urging Polanski's release from detention in Switzerland.[16][21][22][23] An anonymous MSNBC source defended the termination, \"It gives us pause when we see alt-right figures whipping up attention about our action but the reality is Seder made a rape joke.\"[18] After news of the termination broke, Cernovich released a Twitter video celebrating his triumph.[15][N 1]\nSeder noted that advertisers on The Majority Report with Sam Seder podcast were also being contacted and pressured by Cernovich and his team to cut ties with the show over the tweet.[15] In response, Seder launched a GoFundMe campaign to help maintain funding for the show in the face of potential loss of advertising revenue.[15] In an episode of the podcast titled, \"I'm Under Attack By the Nazi Alt-Right\", Seder said, \"this smear involves the willful misinterpretation of a tweet that I posted in 2009\" and that he will \"never be ashamed of criticizing those who would excuse the predation of women or girls.\"[16][18]\nSeder revealed plans to use a portion of the GoFundMe proceeds to produce a three-minute video educating people on Cernovich's tactics.[15] He surmised Cernovich's ploy had been retribution for his frequent criticism of Donald Trump as well as Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of sexual assault.[16][21][N 2] Further, Seder chided MSNBC's decision to terminate his employment concluding, \"I think they're afraid of those people.\"[18][N 3]\n\n\n\nThis was mind-bogglingly stupid, a real textbook case of how not to handle 'controversy' ... Seder was taking the side of abuse victims.\n\n\n\u2014The Washington Post reporter David Weigel on MSNBC's decision to fire Seder.[15]\n\n\nThe news of Seder's dismissal sparked a backlash.[16][24] Over 12,000 people signed a petition protesting Seder's termination, arguing that Cernovich had acted in malice and was deliberately mischaracterizing the tweet.[21][25] AV Club wrote that \"MSNBC has now fully bought into that smear campaign ... whose openly stated goal is the destruction of news outlets just like it through the use of blatantly manipulative trolling techniques.[26] Mother Jones rebuked MSNBC for capitulating \"to the demands of a lunatic conservative.\"[N 4] HuffPost chided that Cernovich was now MSNBC's new \"De Facto Ombudsman.\"[28] MSNBC primetime anchor Chris Hayes tweeted, \"The entire culture and our politics are now dominated by people who have weaponized bad faith and shamelessness.\"[27] Hayes tweeted several times against the decision by his own network, including: \"Also, I reiterate my longstanding position that people shouldn't be fired for a tweet, *particularly* one that is obviously being read in manifestly bad faith.\"[21][29] Actress and comedian Sarah Silverman also tweeted in support of Seder.[N 5]\n\nRehiring[edit]\nThere was considerable dissent within MSNBC over Seder's termination. Some employees expressed concerns that his firing would encourage other far-right personalities to launch similar smear campaigns.[15][22] A senior MSNBC employee characterized the capitulation as \"really weak\" and \"pathetic\".[15][22] MSNBC's management itself was unsettled by the celebratory reaction from the far-right.[15][22] On December 7, 2017, MSNBC decided to reverse their decision to terminate Seder's employment. MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement, \"Sometimes you just get one wrong, and that's what happened here. We made our initial decision for the right reasons\u2014because we don't consider rape to be a funny topic to be joked about. But we've heard the feedback, and we understand the point Sam was trying to make in that tweet was actually in line with our values, even though the language was not. Sam will be welcome on our air going forward.\"[25][30] In response, Seder issued a statement while accepting his job back:I appreciate MSNBC's thoughtful reconsideration and willingness to understand the cynical motives of those who intentionally misrepresented my tweet for their own toxic, political purposes ... We are experiencing an important and long overdue moment of empowerment for the victims of sexual assault and of reckoning for their perpetrators. I'm proud that MSNBC and its staff have set a clear example of the need to get it right.[23][30][N 6]\n\n\nIf you decide to let this guy be the arbiter of what is and is not appropriate, understand who he is.\n\n\n\u2014Sam Seder on Cernovich.[15]\n\n\nColumbia Journalism Review cited the incident as an example of a broader pattern of far-right media personalities using online smear campaigns to get mainstream journalists fired.[31] Cernovich acknowledged that \"some are saying Seder was making a joke or being sarcastic.\"[15][16] However, he said he did not misrepresent the tweet, but merely \"reported on what [Seder] said.\"[15] Cernovich added that \"[t]he left isn't going to stop going through our tweets so we aren't going to stop going through theirs. I wish we would get over people trying to find someone saying a naughty thing. I've been saying that for years. And nobody wants to listen. So fine, we will play by the same rules.\"[15]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nOn August 9, 2005, Seder's wife Nicole Cattell gave birth to their first child, daughter Myla Rae.[32] On March 7, 2013, she gave birth to their second child, Saul.[33][34]\nOn April 27, 2018, Seder announced that the couple were separated.[35]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1997\n\nWho's the Caboose?\n\nMax\n\nAlso director and writer\n\n\n1998\n\nNext Stop Wonderland\n\nKevin Monteiro\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\nHappy Accidents\n\nNed\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\nEndsville\n\nWood Salesman\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\nBeacon Hill\n\nRafe Coulter\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nFits and Starts\n\nDressler\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\nThe Bob's Burgers Movie\n\nHugo Habercore\n\n\n\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1995\n\nAll-American Girl\n\nPhil\n\nEpisode: \"Young Americans\"\n\n\n1995\n\nParty of Five\n\nGreg\n\nEpisode: \"Best Laid Plans\"\n\n\n1996\n\nThe Show\n\nTom Delaney\n\n8 episodes\n\n\n1996\n\nBoys & Girls\n\nDavid Waits\n\nTelevision film\n\n\n1997\n\nThe Big Fall\n\nGary Snider\n\nTelevision film\n\n\n1997\n\nSpin City\n\nGeorge / Bogus Temp\n\n2 episodes\n\n\n1997\n\nThe Magic School Bus\n\nVoice\n\nEpisode: \"In the City\"\n\n\n1998\n\nGrown-Ups\n\nPhil\n\nTelevision film\n\n\n1999\n\nThe Dick & Paula Celebrity Special\n\nWilliam Clark\n\nEpisode: \"Merriweather Lewis and Curly Howard\"\n\n\n1999\n\nPulp Comics: Louis C.K.'s Filthy Stupid Talent Show\n\nSeth the Jew\n\nTelevision short\n\n\n2000\n\nSex and the City\n\nLew\n\nEpisode: \"Sex and Another City\"\n\n\n2002\u20132004\n\nHome Movies\n\nFenton Mulley / Cho / Paula's Father\n\n12 episodes\n\n\n2004\n\nPilot Season\n\nMax Rabin\n\n2 episodes\n\n\n2005\n\nWonder Showzen\n\nBug\n\nEpisode: \"Patience\"\n\n\n2005\u20132007\n\nLucy, the Daughter of the Devil\n\nSpecial Father #2 / The Senator\n\n11 episodes\n\n\n2006\n\nO'Grady\n\nMr. Chip Hurley\n\nEpisode: \"A Stronger O'Grady\"\n\n\n2006\n\nCheap Seats: Without Ron Parker\n\nSir Aglovale\n\nEpisode: \"Unbelievable Sports 1\"\n\n\n2008\n\nAssy McGee\n\nPrincipal Jenkins / Douche\n\n2 episodes; voice role\n\n\n2011\u2013present\n\nBob's Burgers\n\nHugo Habercore / Harold Cranwinkle / Al Genarro\n\n32 episodes\n\n\n2015\n\nMaron\n\nSam Seder\n\nEpisode: \"Patent Troll\"\n\n\n2017\n\nThe Good Fight\n\nVaughn Yenko\n\nEpisode: \"Stoppable: Requiem for an Airdate\"\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Thank you to everybody who emailed MSNBC,\" Cernovich said in a video he posted on Twitter. \"Thank you to all of you. You're heroes. You're heroes because you emailed MSNBC and you let them know about the tweet. You let them know the people will be heard.\"[15]\n\n^ Seder explained Cernovich's ploy thusly: \"If they succeed in getting me fired or scaring my advertisers away, they will continue until they have silenced anyone who'd criticize Roy Moore, criticize President [Donald] Trump or criticize the conservative movement.\"[16]\n\n^ \"According to Seder, he and MSNBC management never had a serious discussion about the tweet, what it meant and whether it posed a problem for MSNBC social-media standards. \"If there was any conversation about the tweet,\" says Seder, \"it had nothing to do with substance. It was, 'This is blowing up.'\" And from what Seder can tell, his position with the network didn't much concern the company's top managers. \"I only spoke to the PR guy and they only fired me after there was an imminent story,\" says Seder. An MSNBC spokesman responds that the company requested Seder's written defense of his tweet, and then considered that defense in reaching its decision on the contract renewal. Seder's conclusion: \"I think they're afraid of those people.\"[18]\n\n^ Mother Jones wrote: \"thanks to the demands of a lunatic conservative, they cut off Sam Seder for a single lame joke made on Twitter in 2009.\"[27]\n\n^ Sarah Silverman's tweet: \"Yo @msnbc ur gonna let Mr Pizzagate be ur moral compass?\"[15]\n\n^ Seder further elaborated on this statement in a phone interview with The New York Times: \"I think [MSNBC] messed up, and I think they hopefully learned a lesson that you have to make an assessment on the substance. Media outlets in general have been very reluctant to do that, and I think it's become so much more important in this era, both because of technology and because of, frankly, the depravity of some elements of our society.\"[21]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"About TheMajorityReport\".

She was the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee alongside U.S. Senator John McCain.\nPalin was elected to the Wasilla city council in 1992 and became mayor of Wasilla in 1996. In 2003, after an unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor, she was appointed chair of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, responsible for overseeing the state's oil and gas fields for safety and efficiency. In 2006, at age 42, she became the youngest person and the first woman to be elected governor of Alaska.[1] Immense legal fees incurred by both Palin and the state of Alaska from her fights against ethics investigations led to her resignation in 2009.[2]\nPalin was nominated as John McCain's vice presidential running mate at the 2008 Republican National Convention. She was the first Republican female vice presidential nominee and the second female vice presidential nominee of a major party, after Geraldine Ferraro in 1984. The McCain-Palin ticket subsequently lost the 2008 election to the Democratic Party's then-U.S. Senators Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Throughout the race, her public image and experience came under media attention. Although her vice presidential bid alongside McCain was unsuccessful, the 2008 presidential election significantly raised Palin's national profile.\nSince her resignation as governor in 2009, she has campaigned for the fiscally conservative Tea Party movement. In addition, she has publicly endorsed several candidates in multiple election cycles, notably including Donald Trump in his 2016 run for president. She has also led a career as a television personality. From 2010 to 2015, she provided political commentary for Fox News.[3] She hosted TLC's Sarah Palin's Alaska in 2010\u201311 and Amazing America with Sarah Palin on the Sportsman Channel in 2014\u201315.[4][5] From 2014 to 2015, she oversaw a short-lived subscriber-based online TV channel, the Sarah Palin Channel, via TAPP TV.[6][7] Her personal memoir Going Rogue, written following the 2008 election, has sold more than one million copies.\nIn the summer of 2022, Palin ran in the special election for Alaska's at-large congressional seat that was vacated after the death of Representative Don Young,[8] but lost to Democrat Mary Peltola, who completed Young's unfinished term.[9] Palin faced Peltola and others again in the November general election for the same seat, and again lost to  Peltola, who won re-election to serve a full two-year term.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nPalin was born in Sandpoint, Idaho, the third of four children (three daughters and one son) of Sarah \"Sally\" Heath (n\u00e9e Sheeran; 1940\u20132021),[10] a school secretary, and Charles R. \"Chuck\" Heath (born 1938), a science teacher and track-and-field coach. Palin's siblings are Chuck Jr., Heather, and Molly.[11][12][13][14] Palin is of English, Irish, and German ancestry.[15]\nWhen Palin was a few months old, the family moved to Skagway, Alaska,[16] where her father had been hired to teach.[17] They relocated to Eagle River, Anchorage in 1969, and settled in Wasilla, Alaska in 1972.[18][19]\nPalin played flute in the junior high band. She attended Wasilla High School, where she was head of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes[20] and a member of the girls' basketball and cross-country running teams.[21] During her senior year, she was co-captain and point guard of the basketball team that won the 1982 Alaska state championship, earning the nickname \"Sarah Barracuda\" for her competitive streak.[22][23][24]\nIn 1984, Palin won the Miss Wasilla beauty pageant;[25] she finished third (as second runner-up) in the Miss Alaska pageant, where she won the title of \"Miss Congeniality\".[26][27][28] She played the flute in the talent portion of the contest.[29] One author reports that she received the Miss Congeniality award in the Miss Wasilla contest (but this is disputed by another contestant and classmate of Palin's),[25] and a college scholarship.[22]\nAfter graduating from high school in 1982, Palin enrolled at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.[30] Shortly after arriving in Hawaii, Palin transferred to Hawaii Pacific University in Honolulu for a semester in the fall of 1982. She returned to the mainland, enrolling at North Idaho College, a community college in Coeur d'Alene, for the spring and fall semesters of 1983.[31] She transferred and enrolled at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho for an academic year starting in August 1984. Beginning in the fall of 1985, she attended Matanuska-Susitna College in Alaska. Palin returned to the University of Idaho in January 1986 and received her bachelor's degree in communications with an emphasis in journalism in May 1987.[31][32][33][34]\n\nEarly career\nAfter graduation, Palin worked as a sportscaster for KTUU-TV and KTVA-TV in Anchorage[35][36] and as a sports reporter for the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman,[37][38] fulfilling an early ambition.[39]\n\nPolitical career\nMain articles: Early political career of Sarah Palin and Electoral history of Sarah Palin\nCity council\nPalin was elected to the Wasilla City Council in 1992, winning 530 votes to 310.[40][41] Throughout her tenure on the city council and the rest of her political career, Palin has been a Republican since registering in 1982.[42]\n\nMayor of Wasilla\nConcerned that revenue from a new Wasilla sales tax would not be spent wisely,[43] Palin ran for mayor of Wasilla in 1996, defeating incumbent mayor John Stein[44] 651 to 440 votes.[45] Her biographer described her campaign as targeting wasteful spending and high taxes;[22] her opponent, Stein, said that Palin introduced abortion, gun rights, and term limits as campaign issues.[46] The election was nonpartisan, though the state Republican Party ran advertisements for Palin.[46] She ran for reelection against Stein in 1999 and won, 909 votes to 292.[47] In 2002, she completed the second of the two consecutive three-year terms allowed by the city charter.[48] She was elected president of the Alaska Conference of Mayors in 1999.[49]\n\nFirst term\nUsing revenue generated by a 2% sales tax, which had been approved by Wasilla voters in October 1992,[50][51] Palin cut property taxes by 75% and eliminated personal property and business inventory taxes.[52][53] Using municipal bonds, she made improvements to the roads and sewers and increased funding to the police department.[46] She oversaw creation of new bike paths and procured funding for storm-water treatment to protect freshwater resources. At the same time, she reduced the budget of the local museum and postponed discussions about a new library and city hall, which some of the council believed was needed.[52]\nSoon after taking office in October 1996, Palin eliminated the position of museum director.[54] She asked for updated resumes and resignation letters from \"city department heads who had been loyal to Stein\", although the mayor's office was considered a non-partisan position.[55] These included the city police chief, public works director, finance director, and librarian.[56] Palin stated this request was to find out their intentions and whether they supported her. She temporarily required department heads to get her approval before talking to reporters, saying they needed to learn her administration's policies.[56] She created the position of city administrator[46] and reduced her own $68,000 salary by 10%. By mid 1998 this action was reversed by the city council.[57]\nIn October 1996, Palin asked library director Mary Ellen Emmons if she would object to the removal of a book from the library if people were picketing to have the book removed.[58] Emmons responded that she would, and others as well.[58] Palin stated that she had not been proposing censorship but had been discussing many issues with her staff that were \"both rhetorical and realistic in nature.\"[58] No attempt was made to remove books from the library during Palin's tenure as mayor.[59]\nPalin said she fired Police Chief Irl Stambaugh because he did not fully support her efforts to govern the city.[60] Stambaugh filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination and violation of his free speech rights.[61] The judge dismissed Stambaugh's lawsuit, holding that the police chief served at the discretion of the mayor and could be terminated for nearly any reason, even a political one,[62][63] and ordered Stambaugh to pay Palin's legal fees.[62]\n\nSecond term\nDuring her second term as mayor, Palin proposed and promoted the construction of a municipal sports center to be financed by a 0.5%[46] sales tax increase and a $14.7\u00a0million bond issue.[64] Voters approved the measure by a 20-vote margin, and the Wasilla Multi-Use Sports Complex (later named the Curtis D. Menard Memorial Sports Center) was built on time and under budget. However, the city spent an additional $1.3\u00a0million because of an eminent domain lawsuit caused by the city's failure to obtain clear title to the property before beginning construction.[64] The city's long-term debt grew from about $1\u00a0million to $25\u00a0million because of expenditures of $15\u00a0million for the sports complex, $5.5\u00a0million for street projects, and $3\u00a0million for water improvement projects. The Wall Street Journal characterized the project as a \"financial mess.\"[64] A city council member defended the spending increases as being necessitated by the city's growth during that time.[65]\nPalin also joined with nearby communities in hiring the Anchorage-based lobbying firm of Robertson, Monagle & Eastaugh to lobby for federal funds. The firm secured nearly $8\u00a0million in earmarks for the Wasilla city government,[66] including $500,000 for a youth shelter, $1.9\u00a0million for a transportation hub, and $900,000 for sewer repairs.[67] In 2008, Wasilla's current mayor credited Palin's 75 percent property tax cuts and infrastructure improvements with bringing \"big-box stores\" and 50,000 shoppers per day to Wasilla.[40]\n\nState politics\nIn 2002, Palin ran for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor, coming in second to Loren Leman in a five-way Republican primary.[68] Following her defeat, she campaigned throughout the state for the nominated Republican governor-lieutenant governor ticket of Frank Murkowski and Leman.[69] Murkowski and Leman won and Murkowski resigned from his long-held U.S. Senate seat in December 2002 to assume the governorship. Palin was said to be on the \"short list\" of possible appointees to Murkowski's U.S. Senate seat,[69] but Murkowski ultimately appointed his daughter, State Representative Lisa Murkowski, as his successor in the Senate.[70]\nGovernor Murkowski offered other jobs to Palin and, in February 2003, she accepted an appointment to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which oversees Alaska's oil and gas fields for safety and efficiency.[69] While she had little background in the area, she said she wanted to learn more about the oil industry and was named chair of the commission and ethics supervisor.[69][71][72] By November 2003, she was filing nonpublic ethics complaints with the state attorney general and the governor against a fellow commission member, Randy Ruedrich, a former petroleum engineer and at the time the chair of the state Republican Party.[69] He was forced to resign in November 2003.[69] Palin resigned in January 2004 and put her protests against Ruedrich's \"lack of ethics\" into the public arena[22][69] by filing a public complaint against Ruedrich,[73] who was then fined $12,000. She joined with Democratic legislator Eric Croft[74] in complaining that Gregg Renkes, then the attorney general of Alaska,[75] had a financial conflict of interest in negotiating a coal exporting trade agreement.[76][77] Renkes also resigned his post.[22][72]\nFrom 2003 to June 2005, Palin served as one of three directors of \"Ted Stevens Excellence in Public Service, Inc.,\" a 527 group designed to provide political training for Republican women in Alaska.[78] In 2004, Palin told the Anchorage Daily News that she had decided not to run for the U.S. Senate that year against the Republican incumbent, Lisa Murkowski, because her teenage son opposed it. Palin said, \"How could I be the team mom if I was a U.S. Senator?\"[79]\n\nGovernor of Alaska\nMain article: Governorship of Sarah Palin\nPalin visits soldiers of the Alaska National Guard, July 24, 2007\nIn 2006, running on a clean-government platform, Palin defeated incumbent Governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican gubernatorial primary.[80][81] Her running mate was State Senator Sean Parnell.[82]\nIn the November election, Palin was outspent but victorious, defeating former Democratic governor Tony Knowles 48.3% to 41.0%.[22] She became Alaska's first female governor and, at the age of 42, the youngest governor in Alaskan history. She was the state's first governor to have been born after Alaska achieved U.S. statehood, and the first who was not inaugurated in the capital, Juneau (she chose to have the ceremony in Fairbanks instead).\nShe took office on December 4, 2006. For most of her term, she was very popular with Alaska voters. Polls taken in 2007 showed her with 93% and 89% popularity among all voters.[83] The Anchorage Daily News and The Weekly Standard called her \"the most popular governor in America.\"[74][83] A poll taken in late September 2008, after Palin was named to the national Republican ticket, showed her popularity in Alaska at 68%.[84] A poll taken in May 2009 indicated Palin's popularity among Alaskans had declined to 54% positive and 41.6% negative.[85]\nPalin declared that top priorities of her administration would be resource development, education and workforce development, public health and safety, and transportation and infrastructure development.[1] She had championed ethics reform throughout her election campaign. Her first legislative action after taking office was to push for a bipartisan ethics reform bill. She signed the resulting legislation in July 2007, calling it a \"first step\" and declaring that she remained determined to clean up Alaska politics.[86]\nPalin frequently broke with the Alaskan Republican establishment.[87][88] For example, she endorsed Parnell's bid to unseat Don Young, the state's longtime at-large U.S. Representative.[89] She publicly challenged then-U.S. Senator Ted Stevens to \"come clean\" about the federal investigation into his financial dealings. She promoted the development of oil and natural-gas resources in Alaska, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Proposals to drill for oil in ANWR have catalyzed national debate.[90]\nIn 2006, Palin obtained a passport[91] and in 2007 traveled for the first time outside North America, on a trip to Kuwait. There she visited the Khabari Alawazem Crossing at the Kuwait\u2013Iraq border, and met with members of the Alaska National Guard at several bases.[92] On her return journey she visited injured soldiers in Germany.[93]\n\nBudget, spending, and federal funds\nPalin in Germany, July 2007\nIn June 2007, Palin signed a record $6.6\u00a0billion operating budget into law.[94] At the same time, she used her veto power to make the second-largest cuts of the capital budget in state history. The $237\u00a0million in cuts represented over 300 local projects and reduced the capital budget to $1.6\u00a0billion.[95]\nIn 2008, Palin vetoed $286 million, cutting or reducing funding for 350 projects from the FY09 capital budget.[96]\nPalin followed through on a campaign promise to sell the Westwind II jet, a purchase made by the Murkowski administration for $2.7\u00a0million in 2005 against the wishes of the legislature.[97]\nIn August 2007, the jet was listed on eBay, but the sale fell through, and the plane later sold for $2.1\u00a0million through a private brokerage firm.[98]\n\nGubernatorial expenditures\nPalin lived in Juneau during the legislative session, and lived in Wasilla and worked out of offices in Anchorage the rest of the year. Since the office in Anchorage was 565 miles from Juneau, while she worked there, state officials said she was permitted to claim a $58 per diem travel allowance and reimbursement for hotel. She filed for per diem, claiming a total of $16,951, but rather than stay at a hotel overnight, regularly commuted the 50\u00a0miles one way to her home in Wasilla.[99] She did not use the former governor's private chef.[100]\nBoth Republicans and Democrats criticized Palin for taking the per diem, as well as an additional $43,490 in travel expenses on occasions when her family accompanied her on state business.[101][102] Palin's staffers responded that these practices were in line with state policy, that her gubernatorial expenses were 80% below those of her predecessor Murkowski,[101] and that \"many of the hundreds of invitations Palin receives include requests for her to bring her family, placing the definition of 'state business' with the party extending the invitation.\"[99]\nIn February 2009, the State of Alaska, reversing a policy that had treated the payments as legitimate business expenses under the Internal Revenue Code, decided that per diems paid to state employees for stays in their own homes would be treated as taxable income and will be included in employees' gross income on their W-2 forms.[103] Palin had ordered the review of the tax policy.[104]\nIn December 2008, an Alaska state commission recommended increasing the governor's annual salary from $125,000 to $150,000. Palin said that she would not accept the pay raise.[105] In response, the commission dropped the recommendation.[106]\n\nFederal funding\nIn her State of the State address on January 17, 2008, Palin declared that the people of Alaska \"can and must continue to develop our economy, because we cannot and must not rely so heavily on federal government [funding].\"[107] Alaska's federal congressional representatives cut back on pork-barrel project requests during Palin's time as governor.[108]\nWhile the state has no sales tax or income tax, royalty revenues from the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field (consisting mostly of state-owned lands) have supported large state budgets since 1980. The exact amounts have depended on the prevailing price of petroleum. As a result, state revenues doubled to $10 billion in 2008. Despite this, for the 2009 state budget, Palin gave a list of 31 proposed federal earmarks or requests for funding, totaling $197 million, to Alaska's senior U.S. Senator Ted Stevens. This was a major decrease from earlier years.[109][110] Palin has said that her decreasing support for federal funding was a source of friction between her and the state's congressional delegation; Palin requested less in federal funding each year than her predecessor Frank Murkowski requested in his last year.[111]\n\nBridge to Nowhere\nMain article: Gravina Island Bridge\nPalin visiting Ketchikan during her gubernatorial campaign, 2006\nIn 2002, it was proposed that a for-profit prison corporation, Cornell Corrections, build a prison on Gravina Island. To connect Gravina with nearby Ketchikan, on Revillagigedo Island, it was originally planned that the federal government spend $175 million on building a bridge and another $75 million to connect it to the power grid with an electrical intertie. The Ketchikan Borough Assembly turned the proposal down when the administration of Governor Tony Knowles also expressed its disfavor with the idea. Eventually, the corporation's prison plans led to the exposure of the wide-ranging Alaska political corruption probe, which eventually ensnared Alaska's U.S. Senator Ted Stevens. The bridge idea persisted through the administration of former U.S. senator and then-governor Frank Murkowski. The 2005 Highway Bill provided for $223m to build the Gravina Island Bridge. The provisions and earmarks[112] were negotiated by Alaska's Rep. Don Young, who chaired the House Transportation Committee, and were supported by the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Ted Stevens.[113] This bridge, nicknamed \"The Bridge to Nowhere\" by critics, was intended to replace the auto ferry that is currently the only connection between Ketchikan and its airport. While the federal earmark was withdrawn after meeting opposition from Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, the state of Alaska still received $300 million in transportation funding,[113] with which the state of Alaska continued to study improvements in access to the airport, which conceivably could include improvements to the ferry service.[114] In 2006, Palin had run for governor with a \"build-the-bridge\" plank in her platform,[115] saying she would \"not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project ... into something that's so negative.\"[116] Palin criticized the use of the word \"nowhere\" as insulting to local residents[115][117] and urged speedy work on building the infrastructure \"while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist.\"[117] Despite the demise of the bridge proposal, Palin spent $26 million in transportation funding for the planned 3-mile access road on Gravina island that ultimately had little use.[118][119] A spokesman for Alaska's Department of Transportation said that it had been within Palin's power to cancel the road project but noted the state was considering cheaper designs to complete the bridge project, and that in any case the road would open up the surrounding lands for development.[115][120] As governor, Palin canceled the Gravina Island Bridge in September 2007, saying that Congress had \"little interest in spending any more money\" due to \"inaccurate portrayals of the projects.\"[121] Alaska did not return the $442 million in federal transportation funds.[122]\nIn 2008, as a vice-presidential candidate, Palin characterized her position as having told Congress \"thanks, but no thanks, on that bridge to nowhere.\" A number of Ketchikan residents said that the claim was false and a betrayal of Palin's previous support for their community.[122] Some critics said that her statement was misleading, as she had expressed support for the spending project and kept the federal money after the project was canceled.[123]\n\nGas pipeline\nSee also: Alaska gas pipeline\nIn August 2008, Palin signed a bill authorizing the State of Alaska to award TransCanada Pipelines\u2014the sole bidder to meet the state's requirements\u2014a license to build and operate a pipeline to transport natural gas from the Alaska North Slope to the continental United States through Canada.[124] The governor also pledged $500 million in seed money to support the project.[125]\nIt was estimated that the project would cost $26 billion.[124] Newsweek described the project as \"the principal achievement of Sarah Palin's term as Alaska's governor.\"[126] The pipeline also faces legal challenges from Canadian First Nations.[126]\n\nPredator control\nSee also: Governorship of Sarah Palin \u00a7\u00a0Environment\nIn 2007, Palin supported a 2003 Alaska Department of Fish and Game policy allowing the hunting of wolves from the air as part of a predator control program intended to increase moose and caribou populations for subsistence-food gatherers and other hunters.[127][128] In March 2007, the department offered a bounty of $150 per wolf would be paid to the 180 volunteer pilots and gunners in five areas of Alaska to offset fuel costs. In the preceding four years, 607 wolves had been killed. State biologists wanted 382 to 664 wolves to be killed by the end of the predator-control season in April 2007. Wildlife activists sued the state- A state judge declared the bounty illegal on the basis that a bounty would have to be offered by the Board of Game and not by the Department of Fish and Game.[127][129] On August 26, 2008, Alaskans voted against ending the state's predator control program.[130]\n\nPublic Safety Commissioner dismissal\nMain article: Alaska Public Safety Commissioner dismissal\nPalin dismissed Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan on July 11, 2008, citing performance-related issues, such as not being \"a team player on budgeting issues\"[131] and \"egregious rogue behavior.\"[132] Palin attorney Thomas Van Flein said that the \"last straw\" was Monegan's planned trip to Washington, D.C., to seek funding for a new, multimillion-dollar sexual assault initiative the governor hadn't yet approved.[133]\nMonegan said that he had resisted persistent pressure from Palin, her husband, and her staff, including state Attorney General Talis J. Colberg, to fire Palin's ex-brother-in-law, Alaska State Trooper Mike Wooten; Wooten was involved in a child custody battle with Palin's sister after a bitter divorce that included an alleged death threat against Palin's father.[134][135] At one point Sarah and Todd Palin hired a private investigator to gather information, seeking to have Wooten officially disciplined.[136] Monegan stated that he learned an internal investigation had found all but two of the allegations to be unsubstantiated, and Wooten had been disciplined for the others \u2013 an illegal moose killing and the tasering of his 11-year-old stepson, who had reportedly asked to be tasered.[135] He told the Palins that there was nothing he could do because the matter was closed.[137] When contacted by the press for comment, Monegan first acknowledged pressure to fire Wooten but said that he could not be certain that his own firing was connected to that issue;[135] he later asserted that the dispute over Wooten was a major reason for his firing.[138] Palin stated on July 17 that Monegan was not pressured to fire Wooten, nor dismissed for not doing so.[131][137]\nMonegan said the subject of Wooten came up when he invited Palin to a birthday party for his cousin, state senator Lyman Hoffman, in February 2007 during the legislative session in Juneau. \"As we were walking down the stairs in the capitol building she wanted to talk to me about her former brother-in-law,\" Monegan said. \"I said, 'Ma'am, I need to keep you at arm's length with this. I can't deal about him with you.[139] She said, 'OK, that's a good idea.'\"[135]\nPalin said there was \"absolutely no pressure ever put on Commissioner Monegan to hire or fire anybody, at any time. I did not abuse my office powers. And I don't know how to be more blunt and candid and honest, but to tell you that truth. To tell you that no pressure was ever put on anybody to fire anybody.\" Todd Palin gave a similar account.[140]\nOn August 13, she acknowledged that a half dozen members of her administration had made more than two dozen calls on the matter to various state officials. \"I do now have to tell Alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist, although I have only now become aware of it\", she said.[137][139][141] Palin said, \"Many of these inquiries were completely appropriate. However, the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure, presumably at my direction.\"[131][142]\nChuck Kopp, whom Palin had appointed to replace Monegan as public safety commissioner, received a $10,000 state severance package after he resigned following just two weeks on the job. Kopp, the former Kenai chief of police, resigned July 25 following disclosure of a 2005 sexual harassment complaint and letter of reprimand against him. Monegan said that he did not receive a severance package from the state.[131]\n\nLegislative investigation\nOn August 1, 2008, the Alaska Legislature hired an investigator, Stephen Branchflower, to review the Monegan dismissal. Legislators stated that Palin had the legal authority to fire Monegan, but they wanted to know whether her action had been motivated by anger at Monegan for not firing Wooten.[143] The atmosphere was bipartisan and Palin pledged to cooperate.[143][144] Wooten remained employed as a state trooper.[136] She placed an aide on paid leave due to a tape-recorded phone conversation that she deemed improper, in which the aide, appearing to act on her behalf, complained to a trooper that Wooten had not been fired.[145]\nSeveral weeks after the start of what the media referred to as \"troopergate\", Palin was chosen as John McCain's running mate.[143] On September 1, Palin asked the legislature to drop its investigation, saying that the state Personnel Board had jurisdiction over ethics issues.[146] The Personnel Board's three members were first appointed by Palin's predecessor, and Palin reappointed one member in 2008.[147] On September 19, Todd Palin and several state employees refused to honor subpoenas, the validity of which were disputed by Talis Colberg, Palin's appointee as Alaska's attorney general.[148] On October 2, a court rejected Colberg's challenge to the subpoenas,[149] and seven of the witnesses, not including Todd Palin, eventually testified.[150]\n\nBranchflower Report\nOn October 10, 2008, the Alaska Legislative Council unanimously voted to release, without endorsing,[151] the Branchflower Report, in which investigator Stephen Branchflower found that firing Monegan \"was a proper and lawful exercise of her constitutional and statutory authority,\" but that Palin abused her power as governor and violated the state's Executive Branch Ethics Act when her office pressured Monegan to fire Wooten.[152] The report stated that \"Governor Palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates to advance a personal agenda, to wit: to get Trooper Michael Wooten fired.\"[153] The report also said that Palin \"permitted Todd Palin to use the Governor's office [...] to continue to contact subordinate state employees in an effort to find some way to get Trooper Wooten fired.\"[153][154]\nPalin's attorneys condemned the Branchflower Report as \"misleading and wrong on the law\"[155] and an attempt to \"smear the governor by innuendo.\"[156] The day after the report was released, Palin said she was \"very, very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing\" or \"any kind of unethical activity.\"[157]\n\nAlaska Personnel Board investigation and report\nThe bipartisan State of Alaska Personnel Board reviewed the matter at Palin's request.[158] On September 15, the Anchorage law firm of Clapp, Peterson, Van Flein, Tiemessen & Thorsness filed arguments of \"no probable cause\" with the Personnel Board on behalf of Palin.[159][160] The Personnel Board retained independent counsel Timothy Petumenos as an investigator. On October 24, Palin gave three hours of depositions with the Personnel Board in St. Louis, Missouri.[161] On November 3, 2008, the State of Alaska Personnel Board reported that there was no probable cause to believe that Palin or any other state official had violated state ethical standards.[162][163][164][165][166] The report further stated that the Branchflower Report used the wrong statute in reaching its conclusions, misconstrued the available evidence and did not consider or obtain all of the material evidence required to properly reach findings in the matter.[162]\n\nJob approval ratings\nAs governor of Alaska, Palin's job approval rating ranged from a high of 93% in May 2007 to a low of 54% in May 2009.[167]\n\n\n\nDate\n\nApproval\n\nDisapproval\n\nPollster\n\n\nMay 15, 2007[168]\n\n93%\n\nNot reported\n\nDittman Research\n\n\nMay 30, 2007[citation needed]\n\n89%\n\nNot reported\n\nIvan Moore Research\n\n\nOctober 19\u201321, 2007[169]\n\n83%\n\n11%\n\nIvan Moore Research\n\n\nApril 10, 2008[170]\n\n73%\n\n7%\n\nRasmussen Reports\n\n\nMay 17, 2008[171]\n\n69%\n\n9%\n\nRasmussen Reports\n\n\nJuly 24\u201325, 2008[172]\n\n80%\n\nNot reported\n\nHays Research Group\n\n\nJuly 30, 2008[172]\n\n64%\n\n14%\n\nRasmussen Reports\n\n\nSeptember 20\u201322, 2008[173]\n\n68%\n\nNot reported\n\nIvan Moore Research\n\n\nOctober 7, 2008[174]\n\n63%\n\n37%\n\nRasmussen Reports\n\n\nMarch 24\u201325, 2009[175]\n\n59.8%\n\n34.9%\n\nHays Research\n\n\nMay 4\u20135, 2009[175]\n\n54%\n\n41.6%\n\nHays Research\n\n\nJune 14\u201318, 2009[176]\n\n56%\n\n35%\n\nGlobal Strategy Group\n\nResignation\nOn July 3, 2009, Palin announced that she would not run for reelection in the 2010 Alaska gubernatorial election and would resign before the end of the month. Palin stated that since August 2008, both she and the state had been spending an \"insane\" amount of time and money ($2.5 million) responding to \"opposition research\", 150 FOIA requests and 15 \"frivolous\" legal ethics complaints filed by \"political operatives\" against her.[177][178][179] She said her resignation was also influenced by her desire not to be a lame duck.[179]\nLieutenant Governor Sean Parnell said that Palin's decision to resign was driven by the high cost of legal fees against ethics investigations; Palin and her husband Todd personally incurred more than $500,000 in legal expenses.[177] Parnell became governor on July 26, 2009, in an inaugural ceremony in Fairbanks, upon Palin's resignation taking effect.[180]\nIn December 2010, new rules governing Alaska executive branch ethics, stemming from Palin's tenure as governor, took effect.[181]\n\"These include allowing for the state to pay legal costs for officials cleared of ethics violations; (and) allowing for a family member of the governor or lieutenant governor to travel at state cost in certain circumstances ...\"[181]\n\n2008 vice presidential campaign\nMain articles: Vice presidential candidacy of Sarah Palin and John McCain 2008 presidential campaign\nSee also: Republican Party (United States) vice presidential candidates, 2008\nPalin addresses the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota\nSeveral conservative commentators met Palin in the summer of 2007.[182] Some of them, such as Bill Kristol, later urged McCain to pick Palin as his vice presidential running mate, arguing that her presence on the ticket would provide a boost in enthusiasm among the Religious Right wing of the Republican party, while her status as an unknown on the national scene would also be a positive factor.[183]\nOn August 24, 2008, Steve Schmidt and a few other senior McCain campaign advisers discussed potential vice presidential picks with the consensus settling around Palin. The following day, the strategists advised McCain of their conclusions and McCain personally called Palin, who was at the Alaska State Fair.[184] In retrospect, Schmidt acknowledged her selection was an immense mistake.[185]\nOn August 27, Palin visited McCain's vacation home near Sedona, Arizona, where she was offered the position of vice-presidential candidate.[186] According to Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for McCain, he had previously met Palin at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington in February 2008 and had come away \"extraordinarily impressed.\"[187] Palin was the only prospective running mate who had a face-to-face interview with McCain to discuss joining the ticket that week.[188] Nonetheless, Palin's selection was a surprise to many because a main criticism he had of Obama was his lack of experience, and speculation had centered on other candidates, such as Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, and former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.[189] On August 29, in Dayton, Ohio, McCain introduced Palin as his running mate,[189] making her the first Alaskan and the second woman to run on a major U.S. party ticket.[189]\nPalin was largely unknown outside Alaska before her selection by McCain.[190] On September 1, 2008, Palin revealed that her daughter Bristol was pregnant and that she would marry the child's father, Levi Johnston.[191] During this period, some Republicans felt that Palin was being unfairly attacked by the media.[192] Timothy Noah of Slate magazine predicted that Palin's acceptance speech would be \"wildly overpraised\" and might end speculation that she was unqualified for the job of vice president because the press had been beating her up for \"various trivial shortcomings\" and had lowered the expectations for her speech.[193] On September 3, 2008, Palin delivered a 40-minute acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention that was well received and watched by more than 40 million people.[194] Wall Street Journal writer Thomas Frank noted the irony in her unattributed quoting of right-wing faux populist Westbrook Pegler's treacly, \"We grow good people in our small towns, with honesty and sincerity and dignity.\"[195]\n\nThe Palins and McCains in Fairfax, Virginia, September 2008\nDuring the campaign, controversy erupted over alleged differences between Palin's positions as a gubernatorial candidate and her position as a vice-presidential candidate. After McCain introduced Palin as his running mate, Newsweek and Time put Palin on their magazine covers,[196] as some of the media alleged that McCain's campaign was restricting press access to Palin by allowing only three one-on-one interviews and no press conferences with her.[197] Palin's first major interview, with Charles Gibson of ABC News, met with mixed reviews.[198] Her interview five days later with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity went more smoothly and focused on many of the same questions from Gibson's interview.[199] Palin's performance in her third interview with Katie Couric, of CBS News, was widely criticized; her poll numbers declined, Republicans expressed concern that she was becoming a political liability, and some conservative commentators called for Palin to resign from the Presidential ticket.[200][201] Other conservatives remained ardent in their support for Palin, accusing the columnists of elitism.[202] Following this interview, some Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Bill Kristol, questioned the McCain campaign's strategy of sheltering Palin from unscripted encounters with the press.[203]\nPalin reportedly prepared intensively for the October 2 vice-presidential debate with Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden at Washington University in St. Louis. Some Republicans suggested that Palin's performance in the interviews would improve public perceptions of her debate performance by lowering expectations.[200][204][205] Polling from CNN, Fox and CBS found that while Palin exceeded most voters' expectations, they felt that Biden had won the debate.[206][207]\n\nSarah Palin at campaign rally in Carson City, Nevada, September 13, 2008\nUpon returning to the campaign trail after her debate preparation, Palin stepped up her attacks on the Democratic candidate for president, Illinois Senator Barack Obama. At a fundraising event, Palin explained her new aggressiveness, saying, \"There does come a time when you have to take the gloves off and that time is right now.\"[208] Palin said that her first amendment right to \"call Obama out on his associations\" was threatened by \"attacks by the mainstream media.\"[209]\nPalin appeared on Saturday Night Live's \"Weekend Update\" segment on October 18. Prior to her appearance, she had been memorably parodied several times by SNL cast member Tina Fey, who was noted for her physical resemblance to the candidate.[210] In the weeks leading up to the election, Palin was also the subject of amateur parodies posted on YouTube.[211]\nControversy arose after it was reported that the Republican National Committee (RNC) spent $150,000 of campaign contributions on clothing, hair styling, and makeup for Palin and her family in September 2008. Campaign spokespersons stated the clothing would be going to charity after the election.[212] Palin and some media outlets blamed gender bias for the controversy.[213][214] At the end of the campaign, Palin returned the clothes to the RNC.[215]\nThe election took place on November 4, and Obama was projected as the winner at 11:00 PM EST.[216] In his concession speech McCain thanked Palin, calling her \"one of the best campaigners I've ever seen, and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength.\"[216] While aides were preparing the teleprompter for McCain's speech, they found a concession speech written for Palin by George W. Bush speechwriter Matthew Scully. Two members of McCain's staff, Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter, told Palin that there was no tradition of Election Night speeches by running mates, and that she would not be speaking. Palin appealed to McCain, who agreed with his staff.[217]\nPolitical scientists have debated the impact that Palin had on the outcome of the 2008 presidential election.[218][219][220] A 2010 study in the journal Electoral Studies found that \"her campaign performance cost McCain just under 2% of the final vote share.\"[218] However, a 2013 study in the journal Political Research Quarterly failed to find an adverse impact.[219]\n\nPost-2008 election\nPalin rallies with Saxby Chambliss in Savannah, Georgia, December 2008\nPalin was the first guest on commentator Glenn Beck's Fox News television show on January 19, 2009, commenting on Barack Obama that he would be her president and that she would assist in any way to bring progress to the nation without abandoning her conservative views.[221]\nIn August 2009, she coined the phrase \"death panel\", to describe rationing of care as part of the proposed health care reform. She stated that it would require Americans such as her parents or her child with Down syndrome, \"to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care.\"[222] The phrase was criticized by many Democrats and Politifact named it the \"Lie of the Year of 2009.\"[223] However, conservatives disputed this and defended her use of the term.[224]\nIn March 2010, Palin started a show to be aired on TLC called Sarah Palin's Alaska.[225] The show was produced by Mark Burnett.[226] Five million viewers tuned in for the premiere episode, a record for TLC.[227] Palin also secured a segment on Fox News.[226] Two guests that she was shown to have interviewed claimed to have never met her. Guests LL Cool J and Toby Keith stated that footage shown on the segment was actually taken from another interview with someone else, but was used in Palin's segment.[228] Fox News and Palin ended this relationship in January 2013.[229] But on June 13, 2013, Palin rejoined Fox News Channel as an analyst.[230]\nOn December 8, 2010, it was reported that SarahPAC and Palin's personal credit card information were compromised through cyber attacks. Palin's team believed the attack was executed by Anonymous during Operation Payback.[231] The report was met with skepticism in the blogosphere.[232] Palin's email had been hacked once before in 2008.[233]\n\nSarahPAC\nOn January 27, 2009, Palin formed the political action committee, SarahPAC.[234][235] Michael Glassner, a former aide to Palin, was appointed as the chief of staff of SarahPAC.[236] The organization, which describes itself as an advocate of energy independence,[237] supports candidates for federal and state office.[238] Following her resignation as governor, Palin stated her intention to campaign \"on behalf of candidates who believe in the right things, regardless of their party label or affiliation.\"[239] It was reported that SarahPAC had raised nearly $1,000,000.[240] A legal defense fund was set up to help Palin challenge ethics complaints, and it had collected approximately $250,000 by mid July 2009.[240][241] In June 2010, Palin's defense fund was ruled illegal and was required to pay back $386,856 it collected in donations because it used Palin's position as governor to raise money for her personal gain. Palin subsequently set up a new defense fund.[242] Sarah PAC was terminated as of December 31, 2016.[243]\nIn the wake of the January 8, 2011, shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Palin faced criticism for her SarahPAC website's inclusion of a political graphic that included a crosshair[244] over Giffords's district. Palin responded on her Facebook page to the criticism, saying, \"Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own. They begin and end with the criminals who commit them\", equating the accusations of her role in the shooting to a \"blood libel\".[245][246][247]\n\nGoing Rogue and America by Heart\nMain article: Going Rogue: An American Life\nPalin on the campaign trail in 2008\nIn November 2009, Palin released her memoir, Going Rogue: An American Life, in which she details her private and political career, including her resignation as Governor of Alaska. Palin said she took the title from the phrase 'gone rogue' used by McCain staffers to describe her behavior when she spoke her mind on the issues during the campaign.[248] The subtitle, \"An American Life,\" mirrors the title of President Ronald Reagan's 1990 autobiography.[249] Less than two weeks after its release, sales of the book exceeded the one million mark, with 300,000 copies sold the first day. Its bestseller rankings were comparable to memoirs by Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.[250][251][252]\nPalin traveled to 11 states in a bus, with her family accompanying her, to promote the book. She made a number of media appearances as well, including a widely publicized interview on November 16, 2009, with Oprah Winfrey.[253] In November 2010 HarperCollins released Palin's second book, titled America by Heart.[254][255][256] The book contains excerpts from Palin's favorite speeches, sermons and literature as well as portraits of people Palin admires, including some she met in rural America on her first book tour.[254]\n\nTea Party movement\nMain article: Tea Party movement\nOn February 6, 2010, Palin was the keynote speaker at the first Tea Party convention in Nashville, Tennessee. Palin said the Tea Party movement is \"the future of politics in America.\"[257] She criticized Obama for rising deficits, and for \"apologizing for America\" in speeches in other countries. Palin said Obama was weak on the War on Terror for allowing the so-called Christmas bomber to board a plane headed for the United States.[258]\n\nPalin addressing a Labor Day rally sponsored by the Tea Party Express (Manchester, NH), 2011\nIn 2011, Palin was the keynote speaker at an annual tax day tea party rally at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group headquartered in Arlington, Virginia,[259] and a featured speaker at a Tea Party Express rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, at which Palin urged members of the Tea Party movement to avoid internal bickering with Establishment Republicans.[260][261]\n\n2010 endorsements\nIn mid-2010, Palin positioned herself as a champion of conservative Republican women, calling for a \"whole stampede of pink elephants\" in the 2010 midterm elections.[262] She endorsed a number of female Republican candidates in primary elections,[263] including Karen Handel, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor of Georgia in the 2010 election.[264] Ryan Rudominer, a spokesman for the House Democratic campaign operation, called her involvement in various U.S. House campaigns a \"great thing across the board\".[265] She spoke at a May 2010 fundraiser for the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion political advocacy group and political action committee that supports pro-life women in politics, in which she coined the term \"mama grizzly\".[266][267] Palin endorsed Nikki Haley for the Republican nomination for Governor of South Carolina three weeks before the election. At the time of the endorsement, Haley was polling last among Republicans; she ended up winning the nomination and general election.[268]\nIn the months ahead of the November 2010 elections, Palin endorsed 64 Republican candidates,[269] and was a significant fundraising asset to those she campaigned for during the primary season.[270] According to Politico, Palin's criteria for endorsing candidates was whether they had the support of the Tea Party movement and the support of the Susan B. Anthony List.[271] In terms of success, Palin was 7\u20132 for Senate endorsements; 7\u20136 for House endorsements; and 6\u20133 in endorsements of gubernatorial candidates in races that were considered 'competitive'.[272] Palin's endorsement of Joe Miller in the August 24 Alaska primary election for U.S. Senator was identified as a pivotal moment in Miller's upset of the incumbent Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski.[273][274] After losing the Republican Party primary to Miller, Murkowski ran as a write-in candidate, defeating both Miller and Democrat Scott McAdams in the general election, winning with a plurality. This made her only the second U.S. Senator, the first write-in candidate to be elected since Strom Thurmond in the United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1954.[275] According to The Daily Beast reporter Shushannah Walshe, Christine O'Donnell's unlikely prospects of upsetting establishment Republican candidate Mike Castle \"changed overnight\" due to Palin's endorsement. O'Donnell defeated Castle in the September 14 primary for Joe Biden's former Senate seat in Delaware.[276] Her O'Donnell endorsement further increased tensions between Palin and the Republican establishment: leading conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer described the endorsement as \"reckless and irresponsible\".[277] In 2010, former congressman and influential TV host Joe Scarborough urged his party to dissociate itself from her.[278] Party strategist Karl Rove argued that it may have been Palin's endorsement of O'Donnell that ultimately cost the GOP the Delaware Senate seat.[279] Commentators including Politico's Ben Smith posited that Palin's support of O'Donnell contributed to dashing Republican hopes of regaining control of the U.S. Senate.[280] Another Palin endorsement carried Nevada's Sharron Angle to a 40.1% primary win,[281] in the race to beat highly endangered incumbent Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, but the controversial Angle's nomination sank those chances. Reid prevailed 50.3% to 44.6% in the 2010 election, despite his losing 14 of Nevada's 17 counties.[282][283] Angle had led by as much as 11% in March and June Rasmussen polling.[284][285]\nPalin's influence over the primaries nonetheless further increased speculation that she would seek to be the party's nominee for president in 2012,[286] with political pundits such as David Frum and Jonathan Chait identifying Palin as the front-runner.[287][288]\n\n2012 election cycle and candidacy speculation\nPalin speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland\nBeginning in November 2008, following Palin's high profile in the presidential campaign, an active \"Draft Palin\" movement started.[289] On February 6, 2010, when asked on Fox News whether she would run for president in 2012, she replied, \"I would be willing to if I believe that it's right for the country.\"[290] She added, \"I won't close the door that perhaps could be open for me in the future.\"[291]\nIn November 2010 Palin confirmed that she was considering running for the Presidency and was \"having that discussion with my family\". She said she realised her level of experience could cause problems with winning the nomination and criticized the \"lamestream media\" for focusing attention on her personal life.[292]\nIn March 2011, Palin and her husband toured India at the invitation of Indian newsmagazine India Today,[293] subsequently visiting Israel.[294] During the tour she was asked about her future candidacy; she said, \"I don't think there needs to be a rush to get out there as a declared candidate. It's a life-changing decision.\"[295] In response to another question, she said, \"It's time that a woman is president of the United States of America.\"[296]\nIn 2011 Palin said the home she had recently purchased in Scottsdale, Arizona, was not a full-time residence,[297] and denied that she was planning to run for the Arizona Senate seat of the retiring Jon Kyl.[298] On October 5, 2011, Palin said she had decided not to seek the Republican nomination for president.[299]\n\n2014 Alaska gubernatorial election endorsement\nPalin speaking at the 2015 CPAC in National HarborIn October 2014, Palin endorsed the \"unity ticket\" of Independent Bill Walker and Democrat Byron Mallott in the 2014 Alaska gubernatorial election, which ran against her successor and former lieutenant governor, Sean Parnell.[300] The endorsement was prompted by Parnell's oil-and-gas industry tax-cuts, which dismantled her administration's \"Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share\" (ACES) plan. She had previously supported a referendum to repeal the tax cuts, which was narrowly defeated in August 2014.[301] Walker and Mallott made the repeal of the tax cuts a centerpiece of their campaign.[302] Walker and Mallott won the governorship in the November 2014 election with 48.1 percent of the vote, versus 45.9 percent for the Republican ticket.[303]\n2016 Presidential election endorsement\nIn January 2016 Palin endorsed Donald Trump.[304] The political director of Trump's campaign, Michael Glassner had been an aide to Palin while she was governor and also the chief of staff of her political action committee SarahPAC.[305]\nIn a May 2016 interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Palin said she would work to defeat Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Palin cited Ryan's reluctance to support Trump for president.[306] In early August, Palin said again that she supported Paul Nehlen, a little-known Republican challenger to Ryan, despite Trump's support of Ryan.[307] A few days later, Ryan overwhelmingly defeated Nehlen in the Republican primary, taking over 84 percent of the vote.[308]\n\n2017 defamation lawsuit\nIn June 2017, Palin filed a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times for an editorial accusing Palin of \"political incitement\" in the run-up to the 2011 shooting of Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, claiming a link to an advertisement from Palin's political action committee\u2014which showed stylized crosshairs against the congressional districts held by 20 Democrats, including Giffords.[309][310] The Times later issued a correction stating that \"no such link was established\" between the advertisement and the shooting and clarifying that what was depicted in the crosshairs in the ads were \"electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers.\" The Times wrote that the error did not \"undercut or weaken the argument of the piece.\"[309] In subsequent testimony at an evidentiary hearing, Times editorial page editor James Bennet stated that the editorial sought to make a point about heated political rhetoric and was not intended to blame Palin for the attack on Giffords.[311]\nPalin's lawsuit was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in August 2017. Judge Jed S. Rakoff ruled that Palin had failed to show actual malice (which, under the landmark case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, is the standard that a defamation plaintiff who is a public figure must show). Rakoff wrote: \"What we have here is an editorial, written and rewritten rapidly in order to voice an opinion on an immediate event of importance, in which are included a few factual inaccuracies somewhat pertaining to Mrs. Palin that are very rapidly corrected. Negligence this may be; but defamation of a public figure it plainly is not.\"[311] In August 2019, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reinstated Palin's suit, ruling that the district court erred when it held an evidentiary hearing on the newspaper's motion to dismiss, rather than deciding the newspaper's motion to dismiss on the pleadings.[312] In August 2020, Rakoff denied both sides' motions for summary judgment and ordered a jury trial in the libel suit.[313][314] As the first libel case against the New York Times to go to trial in the U.S. in 18 years,[315] the suit was closely watched among First Amendment scholars.[315][316] The trial was initially set to begin in January 2022,[317] but was delayed after Palin tested positive for COVID-19.[316] On February 15, 2022, the jury of nine members reached a unanimous verdict in favor of The New York Times, finding that Palin had not proven actual malice.[318] Jurors were aware that the previous day Rakoff said he would dismiss the case regardless of their verdict after some jurors had received push notifications on their smart phones, though jurors said it did not affect their deliberations.[319]\n\n2022 House of Representatives candidacy\nAfter the death of Alaska's at-large congressman Don Young, Palin ran in the 2022 special election for the vacated congressional seat.[320] In August 2021, Palin had hinted at a possible Senate bid, challenging incumbent Republican Lisa Murkowski.[321][322] On April 3, 2022, former president Donald Trump endorsed her run for the House of Representatives.[323]\nPalin was one of the three remaining of 50 initial candidates in the 2022 Alaska's at-large congressional district special election.[324] Al Gross, an independent, dropped out of the \"top four\" runoff, leaving two Republicans remaining, Palin and Nick Begich III, along with Democratic ex-state house member Mary Peltola.[325]\nPalin lost the special election to Mary Peltola following counting on August 31. She received 58,328 votes (30.9%) in the first round, and 85,987 votes (48.5%) once Nick Begich's second preferences had been transferred.[326]\nAfter she lost the race to fill the remainder of Young's term, Palin urged Nick Begich to drop out of the November election for the two-year term, but he refused to do so.[327] She later lost the general election in November by an even larger margin, receiving 25.7% of the vote in the first round to Peltola's 48.8%, then 45% in the second round, to Peltola's 55%.[citation needed]\n\nPolitical positions\nThis article is part of a series onConservatismin the United States\nSchools\nCompassionate\nFiscal\nFusion\nLibertarian\nModerate\nMovement\nNeo\nPaleo\nProgressive\nSocial\nTraditionalist\n\n\nPrinciples\nAmerican exceptionalism\nAnti-communism\nChristian nationalism\nClassical liberalism\nConstitutionalism\nFamily values\nJudeo-Christian values\nLimited government\nMilitarism\nMoral absolutism\nNatural law\nPatriotism\nRepublicanism\nRight to bear arms\nRule of law\nTradition\n\n\nHistory\nConservative coalition\nConservative Democrat\nConservative Manifesto\nLoyalists\nMcCarthyism\nModern timeline\nNew Right\nOld Right\nOverview\nReagan Doctrine\nReaganomics\nStalwart Republicans\nSouthern Agrarians\n\n\nIntellectuals\nBabbitt\nBoorstin\nBozell Jr.\nBuchanan\nBuckley\nBurnham\nChambers\nDolan\nEliot\nGeorge\nGoldberg\nGottfried\nHanson\nHazony\nHoppe\nJaffa\nKirk\nKirkpatrick\nKreeft\nKristol (Bill)\nKristol (Irving)\nKuehnelt-Leddihn\nLaffer\nLasch\nLodge\nLovecraft\nLukacs\nMansfield\nMeese\nMeyer\nNisbet\nNock\nPodhoretz\nRansom\nSantayana\nSowell\nStrauss\nViereck\nVoegelin\nWashington\nWeaver\nWill\n\n\nPoliticians\nAbbott\nAdams\nQuincy Adams\nAgnew\nBuchanan\nBush (George H.

This legislation is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.[329] She also opposes abortion, including in cases of rape, incest, and embryonic stem cell research, but supports it if the mother's life is in jeopardy.[330] She supports parental consent as a requirement for female minors seeking an abortion.[331]\n\nSocial issues\nPalin opposes same-sex marriage[332] and supports capital punishment.[333] She has also called marijuana use a \"minimal issue\" and suggested that arresting cannabis users should be a low priority for local police. Although she opposes full legalization, she admits to smoking marijuana recreationally when it was legal in Alaska.[334]\n\nEducation\nPalin supports sex education in public schools that encourages sexual abstinence along with teaching about contraception.[335] She also supports discussion of creationism during lessons on evolution in public schools.[336] Palin believes evolution \"should be taught as an accepted principle\" and said that her belief in God's role in Earth's creation \"is not part of the state policy or a local curriculum in a school district. Science should be taught in science class.\"[337] (See Creation\u2013evolution controversy.)\n\nGuns\nA Life Member of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA),[338] Palin interprets the Second Amendment as including the right to handgun possession and opposes bans on semi-automatic assault weapons.[339] She supports gun safety education for youth.[340]\n\nEnvironment\nPalin supports off-shore drilling, and land-based drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[90][341] When commenting on the Gulf Coast oil disaster Palin said, \"I repeat the slogan 'drill here, drill now.'\"[342] She said, \"I want our country to be able to trust the oil industry.\"[343] Palin asked supporters to read an article by Thomas Sowell that criticized Obama for having BP pay to an escrow fund.[344]\nPalin considers herself a conservationist[345] and during the 2008 campaign said \"of global warming, climate change, whether it's entirely, wholly caused by man's activities or is part of the cyclical nature of our planet...John McCain and I agree that we have to make sure that we're doing all we can to cut down on pollution.\"[346] She opposed cap-and-trade proposals contained in the yet to be defeated ACES energy bill.[347] Speaking at a 2009 Department of Interior hearing, Palin acknowledged that \"many believe\" a global effort to reduce greenhouse gases is needed. She stated, \"[S]topping domestic energy production of preferred fuels does not solve the issues associated with global warming and threatened or endangered species, but it can make them worse... These available fuels are required to supply the nation's energy needs during the transition to green energy alternatives.\"[348] After the election and the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, Palin spoke at a 2010 California logging conference calling studies supporting the scientific consensus on climate change \"snake oil science\". She attacked what she called \"heavy-handed\" environmental laws and cited her 2008 suit, as Alaska's governor, against the federal government to overturn the listing of polar bears as a threatened species. She considered environmental regulations as an economic burden to businesses trying to recover from the recession and environmental activists as wanting to \"lock up the land\".[345]\n\nForeign policy\nPalin (red shirt) in Kuwait, July 26, 2007\nPalin is a strong supporter of Israel.[349][350] Referring to Iran's threat to Israel, Palin said Obama would be reelected if \"he played the war card. Say he decided to declare war on Iran or decided really come out and do whatever he could to support Israel, which I would like him to do.\"[351]\nOn foreign policy, Palin supported the George W. Bush administration's policies in Iraq, but was concerned that \"dependence on foreign energy\" may be obstructing efforts to \"have an exit plan in place\".[352][353] Palin supports preemptive military action in the face of an imminent threat, and supports U.S. military operations in Pakistan. She also supported the surge strategy in Iraq, the use of additional ground forces in Afghanistan, and, in general, maintaining a strong defensive posture by increasing the defense budget.[354]\nPalin opposed the Obama administration's proposed 2013 military intervention in Syrian Civil War, suggesting to let \"Allah sort it out\" in the Syrian Civil War.[355]\nIn 2008, Palin supported NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia,[356] and affirms that if Russia invaded a NATO member, the United States should meet its treaty obligations.[357] However, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Palin advocated for a reduction in U.S. military aid to Ukraine and criticized U.S. involvement in the conflict.[358]\nPalin opposed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which placed limits on Iran's nuclear program, on the grounds that the treaty was not strict enough. In a September 9, 2015, speech, she said, \"Only in an Orwellian Obama world full of sparkly fairy dust blown from atop his unicorn as he's peeking through a pretty pink kaleidoscope would he ever see victory or safety for America or Israel in this treaty.\"[359]\n\nPersonal life\nThe Palins' home in Wasilla\nIn August 1988, Palin eloped with Todd Palin, her high-school sweetheart,[44] and together they have five children: sons Track Charles James (born 1989)[360][361] and Trig Paxson Van (born 2008), and daughters Bristol Sheeran Marie[362] (born 1990), Willow Bianca Faye (born 1994), and Piper Indy Grace (born 2001).[363][364] Palin's youngest child, Trig, born 2008, was prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome.[365]\nPalin has eight grandchildren, three by Bristol,[366][367] two by Track[368] and three by Willow.[369][370]\nTodd Palin worked for oil company BP as an oil-field production operator, retiring in 2009. He owns a commercial fishing business.[43][371]\nPalin was \"baptized Catholic as a newborn\", as her mother, Sally, had been raised Catholic. However, the Heath family \"started going to non-denominational churches\" thereafter.[372] Later, her family joined the Wasilla Assembly of God, a Pentecostal church,[373] which she attended until 2002.[374] Palin then switched to the Wasilla Bible Church.[375] Several news reports posted immediately after McCain named her his running mate called her the first Pentecostal/charismatic believer to appear on a major-party ticket.[376] However, Palin herself eschews the \"Pentecostal\" or \"charismatic\" label, describing herself as a \"Bible-believing Christian\".[372]\nTodd filed for divorce from Sarah on August 29, 2019, citing \"incompatibility of temperament\". He requested an equal division of debts and assets, and to have joint custody of their son, Trig.[377] The divorce was finalized on March 23, 2020.[378][379]\n\nPublic image\nMain article: Public image of Sarah Palin\nIn June 2008, the Alumni Association of North Idaho College gave Palin its Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award.[31][380]\nPrior to the 2008 Republican National Convention, a Gallup poll found that a majority of voters were unfamiliar with Sarah Palin. During her campaign to become vice president, 39% said Palin was ready to serve as president if needed, 33% said Palin was not, and 29% had no opinion. This was \"the lowest vote of confidence in a running mate since the elder George Bush chose then-Indiana senator Dan Quayle to join his ticket in 1988.\"[381] Following the convention, her image came under close media scrutiny,[382][383] particularly with regard to her religious perspective on public life, her socially conservative views, and her perceived lack of experience or intelligence. Palin's lack of experience in foreign and domestic politics was criticized by conservatives as well as liberals following her nomination.[384][385][386][387] At the same time, Palin became more popular than John McCain among Republicans.[388]\nOne month after being introduced as McCain's running mate, she was viewed both more favorably and unfavorably among voters than her Democratic opponent, Delaware Senator Joe Biden.[389] A plurality of the television audience rated Biden's performance higher at the 2008 vice-presidential debate.[389][390]\nMedia outlets repeated Palin's statement that she \"stood up to Big Oil\" when she resigned after 11 months as the head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. She said it was because of abuses she witnessed involving other Republican commissioners and their ties to energy companies and energy lobbyists; she claimed to have confronted the industry when she raised taxes on oil companies as governor.[391][392] In turn, others have said that Palin is a \"friend of Big Oil\" due to her advocacy for oil exploration and development including for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and for the de-listing of the polar bear as an endangered species.[391][392]\nSince 2017, Palin has spoken out in support of Julian Assange and in 2020 she called for him to be pardoned saying \"I am the first one to admit when I make a mistake and I admit that I made a mistake some years ago, not supporting Julian Assange, thinking that he was a bad guy\u201d.[393]\nPalin was named one of America's \"10 Most Fascinating People of 2008\" by Barbara Walters for an ABC special on December 4, 2008.[394] In April 2010, she was selected as one of the world's 100 most influential people by Time magazine.[395]\n\nElectoral history\n\n1992 Wasilla City Council Seat E election[396]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nSarah Palin \n\n530 \n\n54.92 \n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nJohn Hartrick\n\n310\n\n32.12\n\n\n\n\nWrite-in\n\nOthers\n\n125\n\n12.95\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n965 \n\n\n\n\n\n1996 Wasilla mayoral election[397]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nSarah H.

He is the creator of the Dilbert comic strip, and the author of several nonfiction works of business, commentary, and satire. Adams worked in various clerical roles before he became a full-time cartoonist in 1995. While working at Pacific Bell in 1989, Adams created Dilbert; by the mid-1990s the strip had gained national prominence in America and began to reach a worldwide audience. Dilbert remained popular throughout the following decades, spawning several books written by Adams and becoming a cultural touchstone until it was dropped from syndication. It now runs as a webcomic.\nAdams writes in a satirical way about the social and psychological landscape of white-collar workers in modern corporations. In addition, Adams has written books in various other areas, including the spiritual novella God's Debris and books on political and management topics, including Loserthink.\nIn 2023, Dilbert was dropped by numerous newspapers and its distributor, Andrews McMeel Syndication, after Adams published a video in which he referred to black people as a \"hate group\" and advised white people to \"get the hell away from black people.\" Adams later claimed this was a use of hyperbole.[2][3] He has continued the strip as Dilbert Reborn on his locals.com website since March 2023.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nAdams was born on June 8, 1957,[4] in Windham, New York, the son of Paul and Virginia (n\u00e9e Vining) Adams.[5][6] He has described himself as \"about half German\"[7] and also has English, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, and Dutch ancestry.[8][9] In 2016, Adams said he had a small amount of Native American ancestry,[10] but later discovered via 23andme genetic testing that he does not have any detectable Native American genetic markers.[11]  He was a fan of Peanuts comics while growing up and started drawing comics at age 6.[12] He won a drawing competition at age 11.[12]\nAdams graduated from Windham-Ashland-Jewett Central School in 1975 and was the valedictorian of his class of 39 students. He remained in the area and earned a BA in economics from Hartwick College in 1979.[13] He then moved to California and started work.[12] In 1986, Adams earned an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley.[14] Adams took Dale Carnegie Training and called it \"life changing\".[15]\n\nCareer[edit]\nOffice worker[edit]\nAdams worked closely with telecommunications engineers at Crocker National Bank in San Francisco between 1979 and 1986. Upon joining the organization, he first worked as a teller. After four months in which he was twice held up at gunpoint, he entered a management training program.[12] His positions included management trainee, computer programmer, budget analyst, commercial lender, product manager, and supervisor.[12]\nHe later shifted to work at Pacific Bell. To devote time to developing a new career, he woke up every day at 4 a.m. and spent time at various endeavors; cartooning proved to be the most successful of them. Adams created Dilbert during this period of personal exploration.[16] The Dilbert name was suggested by his former boss, Mike Goodwin. Dogbert, originally named Dildog, was loosely based on his family's deceased pet beagle Lucy.[12] His submissions of Dilbert and other comic panels to various publications, including The New Yorker and Playboy, were not published, but an inspirational letter from a fan persuaded Adams to keep trying.[12] He worked at Pacific Bell between 1986 and June 30, 1995, and the personalities he encountered there inspired many of his Dilbert characters.[17] In 1989, while still employed at Pacific Bell, Adams launched Dilbert with United Media. To maintain his income, he continued to draw his cartoons during the early morning hours. His first payment for Dilbert was a monthly royalty check of $368.62.[12] Dilbert gradually became more popular. It was syndicated in 100 newspapers in 1991 and 400 by 1994. Adams attributed his success to his idea of including his email address in the panels, which resulted in feedback and suggestions from readers.[12]\n\nFull-time cartoonist and author[edit]\nAdams' success grew, and he became a full-time cartoonist as Dilbert reached 800 newspapers. In 1996, his first business book, The Dilbert Principle, was released. It expounded on his concept of the Dilbert principle.[12]\nIn 1997, Adams won the National Cartoonists Society's Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist and Best Newspaper Comic Strip.[12] Logitech CEO Pierluigi Zappacosta invited Adams to impersonate a management consultant, which he did wearing a wig and false mustache. He tricked Logitech managers into adopting a mission statement that Adams described as \"so impossibly complicated that it has no real content whatsoever\".[18][19] His writing in San Jose Mercury News West Magazine regarding the incident earned him an Orwell Award.[20] By 2000, the comic was in 2,000 newspapers in 57 countries and 19 languages.[12]\nHis comic strips were adapted as a Dilbert TV series, which debuted in January 1999 and ran for two seasons on UPN. Adams served as executive producer and showrunner, along with Seinfeld writer Larry Charles. The show earned a Primetime Emmy Award in 1999. On June 28, 2020, Adams asserted to his followers on Twitter that the show had been canceled because he was white and UPN had made a decision to shift toward African-American viewers.[21]\nIn addition to his cartoon work, Adams has written books in various other areas, including self-improvement and religion.[22] His book God's Debris (2001) lays out a theory of pandeism, in which God blows itself up to see what will happen, which becomes the cause of our universe.[23] In The Religion War (2004), Adams suggests that followers of theistic religions such as Christianity and Islam are subconsciously aware that their religions are false, and that this awareness is reflected in their consistently acting as if these religions, and their threats of damnation for sinners, are false. In a 2017 interview, Adams said that his books on religion, not Dilbert, would be his ultimate legacy.[22] In 2023, Adams announced in a pinned tweet that he had re-published God's Debris for free for his subscribers, and would shortly publish an AI-voiced audiobook version.[24]\n\nReal Coffee with Scott Adams[edit]\nIn 2015, Adams wrote blog posts predicting that Donald Trump had a 98 percent chance of winning the presidency based on his persuasion skills, and he started writing about Trump's persuasion techniques. His pieces on this topic grew popular, so he started writing about it regularly.[25] Adams soon developed this as a daily video presentation called Real Coffee with Scott Adams, distributed to Periscope, YouTube, ScottAdamsSays.com,[26] and Locals, where he covered topics such as current events, politics, persuasion, and routes to success.[27]\nReal Coffee with Scott Adams has featured guests such as Naval Ravikant,[28] Ed Latimore,[29] Dave Rubin,[30] Erik Finman,[31] Greg Gutfeld,[32] Matt Gaetz,[33] Ben Askren,[34] Carpe Donktum,[35] Mark Schneider,[36] Steve Hsu,[37] Michael Shellenberger,[38][39] Carson Griffith,[40][41] Shiva Ayyadurai,[42] James Nortey,[43] Clint Morgan,[44] and Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg.[45] In 2018, Kanye West shared multiple clips on Twitter from a Coffee episode titled: \"Scott Adams tells you how Kanye showed the way to The Golden Age. With Coffee.\"[46] In 2020, President Trump retweeted an episode where Adams mocked Joe Biden.[47]\nAdams offers paid subscriptions for exclusive content on Locals.[48] In 2020, Adams said: \"For context, I expect my Dilbert income to largely disappear in the next year as newspapers close up forever. The coronavirus sped up that inevitable trend. Like many of you, I'm reinventing my life for a post-coronavirus world. The Locals platform is a big part of that.\"[49]\n\nOther[edit]\nAdams started Scott Adams Foods, Inc. in 1999, which made the Dilberito and Protein Chef. He sold off his intellectual property in this venture when the product failed in the marketplace in 2003. He was a restaurateur starting in 1997, but exited that business.[when?][50][22]\nAdams was a fan of the science fiction TV series Babylon 5. He appeared in the season 4 episode \"Moments of Transition\" as a character named \"Mr. Adams\" who hires former head of security Michael Garibaldi to locate his megalomaniacal dog and cat.[51] He had a cameo in \"Review\", a third-season episode of the TV series NewsRadio, in which Matthew Brock (played by Andy Dick) becomes an obsessed Dilbert fan. Adams is credited as \"Guy in line behind Dave and Joe in first scene\".[52]\nAdams has been a guest on podcasts including Making Sense with Sam Harris,[53] The Tim Ferriss Show,[54] The James Altucher Show,[55] The Ben Shapiro Show,[56] The Rubin Report,[57] Real Talk with Zuby[58] and The David Pakman Show.[59] He has appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher,[60] Commonwealth Club of California,[61] Fox News[62] and Berkeley Haas.[63] Adams was interviewed for Mike Cernovich's documentaries Silenced (2016)[64] and Hoaxed (2019).[65] In 2016, Adams contributed a chapter of life advice to Tim Ferriss's collection, Tools of Titans.[66]\n\nViews[edit]\nPolitics and social issues[edit]\nAdams has often commented on political and social matters. In 2016, he wrote on his blog: \"I don't vote and I am not a member of a political party.\"[67] In 2007, he suggested that Michael Bloomberg would make a good presidential candidate.[68] Before the 2008 presidential election, he said: \"On social issues, I lean libertarian, minus the crazy stuff.\"[69] In December 2011, he said that if he were president, he would do whatever Bill Clinton advised him to do because that \"would lead to policies that are a sensible middle ground.\"[70] On October 17, 2012, he wrote, \"While I don't agree with Romney's positions on most topics, I'm endorsing him for president.\"[71] In a blog post from September 2017, Adams described himself as being \"left of Bernie Sanders, but with a preference for plans that can work.\"[72] In April 2023, Adams announced via Twitter that he had registered with the Democratic Party, and that party affiliation will not determine who he supports.[73]\nIn 2015, although Adams stated that he would not endorse a candidate for the 2016 elections, he repeatedly praised Donald Trump's persuasion skills.[74][75] He extensively detailed what he called Trump's \"talent stack\".[76] Adams correctly predicted that Trump would win the Republican nomination and the general election.[77][22] In 2018, Adams similarly praised the persuasion skills of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.[78]\nOf the 2016 Democratic National Convention, he said: \"If you're an undecided voter, and male, you're seeing something different. You're seeing a celebration that your role in society is permanently diminished. And it's happening in an impressive venue that was, in all likelihood, designed and built mostly by men.\"[79] Adams said that he temporarily endorsed Hillary Clinton out of fear for his own life, stating that he had received direct and indirect death threats (\"Where I live, in California, it is not safe to be seen as supportive of anything Trump says or does. So I fixed that.\").[80] In late September, however, Adams switched his endorsement from Clinton to Trump. Among his stated primary reasons were his respect for Trump's persuasion skills, Clinton's proposal to raise the inheritance tax, and his concerns over Clinton's health.[81] In mid-October, Adams predicted a Clinton victory would ensure that a male president would never again be elected.[82] He has also stated that writing positively about Trump and supporting him ended his public speaking career and decreased his income by about 40% and number of friends by about 75%.[80][83]\nAdams predicted in March 2020 that Trump, Sanders and Joe Biden would all contract COVID-19 and that one of them would die from it by the end of the year; in December 2020, when all three men remained alive (although Trump did catch the virus), Politico named Adams's prediction one of \"the most audacious, confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications about the year.\"[84] Adams received further attention in December 2021, in reference to his July 2020 prediction that if Biden were to win the 2020 presidential election, then Republicans would be hunted and there's a \"good chance\" they'll be \"dead within a year\" and \"Police will stand down\" \u2014 none of which ultimately occurred.[85] On September 30, 2021, Adams had also tweeted \"My worst prediction of all time was 'If Biden gets elected, there's a good chance you will be dead in a year.' It was closer to two years. I missed it by 100%.\"[86]\nAdams has compared women asking for equal pay to children demanding candy.[87] He pointed out \"satanic coincidences\" in the Joe Biden presidential campaign.[88] After a 2022 mass shooting, Adams tweeted that society leaves parents of troubled teenage boys with only two options: to either watch people die, or murder their own son. He said his comments were inspired by his own stepson, who became addicted to drugs at the age of 14 and later died of a fentanyl overdose.[89][90] Adams's comments were roundly criticized, including by James Gunn, who described himself as a former \"violent teenager addicted to drugs [who] entered recovery with the help & love of his family\".[91]\nIn January 2023, Adams announced that he was considering taking legal action against political cartoonist Ben Garrison for an allegedly defamatory cartoon about his view on masking and COVID-19 vaccines.[92]\n\nRace[edit]\nOn June 28, 2020, Adams said on Twitter that the Dilbert TV show was cancelled because he was white and UPN had decided to focus on an African-American audience, and that he had been \"discriminated against\".[93]\nIn a series of comic strips in September 2022, Dilbert parodied environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) strategies. Part of the plotline involved an African-American character who \"identified as white\" and the company management asking him if he could also identify as gay. According to Adams, the week of September 19, Dilbert was pulled from 77 newspapers owned by Lee Enterprises. Adams also claimed that the cancellation was coincidental.[94][95]\nOn February 22, 2023, Adams responded to a poll by Rasmussen Reports that asked respondents if they agreed with the statement \"it's okay to be white\";[96][94] the Anti-Defamation League said the seemingly innocuous phrase began being used online in 2017 as part of an alt-right trolling campaign and is associated with the white supremacist movement.[3][97] The poll showed 53% of black respondents agreed with the phrase, 26% disagreed, and 21% were not sure.[98] On a YouTube livestream of his Real Coffee with Scott Adams program, Adams, who said he was upset that nearly half did not agree, characterized black people as a \"hate group\" and said, \"the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from black people; just get the fuck away.\"[2][99][100] His comments were widely characterized as racist.[98][101][102] In response to these and other related comments, Dilbert was dropped by numerous newspapers across the country, including the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, and USA Today-affiliated newspapers.[98][103][104] Andrews McMeel Syndication, the distributor of Dilbert, announced on February 27, 2023, that it was severing all ties with Adams.[105][98] Portfolio, his book publisher, announced it was dropping his non-Dilbert book that was scheduled for release in September 2023.[106][107]\nIn response to the incident, Adams said his remarks were hyperbole and that the stories reported about them ignored the context; he conjectured that nobody would disagree with his main points and stated he disavowed racists.[3][108] Adams announced that on March 13, 2023, the strip would return as Dilbert Reborn on the subscription website Locals.[109][110] In a longer interview in September 2023, Adams explained that he had been as offensive as possible on purpose because he wanted to reframe the discussion and said \"If you could reframe race relations, that would be the biggest win in America. And so here's my reframe: Every time somebody says 'The average of this group is not doing as well as the average of this group', they're fucking you. They are not your friend.\"[111]:\u200a27m46s\u200a Adams recovered back all the rights of Dilbert and his books, and was able to keep the advance for his new book, and did not have to pay his agent or his publisher. \"I could not have been luckier. I have the luckiest cancellation of anybody who's ever been cancelled. [...] It just couldn't have been better. It just absolutely could not have been better.\"[111]:\u200a45m58s\u200a\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nSince late 2004, Adams has had focal dystonia, which has affected his ability to draw for lengthy periods.[112]  He now draws on a graphics tablet. He also had spasmodic dysphonia, a condition that causes the vocal cords to behave abnormally. In July 2008, he underwent surgery to reroute the nerve connections to his vocal cords,[113] and his voice is now completely functional.[114]\nAdams married Shelly Miles aboard a yacht, the Galaxy Commodore, on July 22, 2006, in San Francisco Bay, in a ceremony conducted by the ship's captain.[115] The two had met at a gym in Pleasanton, California, where Miles was an employee and Adams was a customer. Adams was stepfather to Miles' two children, Savannah and Justin, the latter of whom died of a fentanyl overdose in 2018 at age 18, prompting Adams to start the service WhenHub.[116][117][118] Adams and Miles divorced in 2014, and Adams said the two remained friends, with Miles moving only one block away after their separation.[119]\nOn Christmas Day in 2019, Adams announced on his podcast that he was engaged to Kristina Basham,[120] and later revealed that they had married on July 11, 2020.  Basham, a model and baker, has two daughters and is a vice president at WhenHub.[22] On March 10, 2022, Adams announced on his YouTube podcast that he and Basham were getting divorced.[121]\nAdams trained as a hypnotist.[122] He credits affirmations for many of his achievements, including scoring in the ninety-fourth percentile on a difficult qualification exam for business school and creating Dilbert's success. He states that the affirmations give him focus.[6] He has described a method he has used that he says gave him success: he pictured in his mind what he wanted and wrote it down 15 times a day on a piece of paper.[123]\n\nRecognition[edit]\nAdams has received recognition for his work, including the National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award and Newspaper Comic Strip Award for 1997 for his work on Dilbert.  He climbed the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD) rankings of the 50 most influential management thinkers, placing 31st in 2001,[124] 27th in 2003,[125] 12th in 2005,[126] and 21st in 2007.[127] He received the Orwell Award in 1998 for his participation in \"Mission Impertinent\" for San Jose Mercury News West Magazine.[20]\n\nIn popular culture[edit]\nAdams has coined several words and phrases over the years, including Confusopoly (businesses that stay afloat only by intentionally misleading their customers), the Dilbert principle (a variant on the Peter principle), Elbonia as shorthand for offshore work, and Pointy-Haired Boss (PHB) and Induhvidual as insults.[128]\nAdams is quoted in the book Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. Adams wrote a blog post in 2010 about Steve Jobs' response to Antennagate, in which he says \"Apple's response to the iPhone 4 problem didn't follow the public relations playbook, because Jobs decided to rewrite the playbook ... If you want to know what genius looks like, study Jobs' words.\"[129] Jobs proudly emailed this around.[130]\n\nPublications[edit]\n\nDilbert compilations[edit]\nAlways Postpone Meetings with Time-Wasting Morons (1992)\nShave the Whales (1994)\nBring Me the Head of Willy the Mailboy!

He is an on-air contributor for CNN, and writes for CNN.com, USA Today, and the Los Angeles Times.\nJennings is a native of Dawson Springs, Kentucky and graduated from high school there in 1996. He was a Coca-Cola National Scholar and featured in their Foundation's magazine in 2006. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Louisville in 2000 where he was a McConnell Scholar. While a student at the University of Louisville, Jennings was a news anchor and reporter for WHAS (AM) Radio. While at WHAS, Jennings won an award from the Associated Press for a series on the plight of the homeless living in downtown Louisville.\nPresident Bush appointed Jennings to the position of special assistant to the president and deputy director of political affairs in February 2006.[1] Jennings had previously served as executive director of the Bush-Cheney campaign in New Mexico in 2004, and as a staff member of the Bush-Cheney campaign in Kentucky in 2000.\nJennings is a founding partner of RunSwitch Public Relations,[2] Kentucky's largest public relations and public affairs firm since 2013.[3] He has been writing a regular column for the Louisville Courier-Journal[4] since 2013, and was signed as an on-air contributor by CNN in 2017.[5] He is routinely cited as an adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell[6] in news publications, and was part of McConnell's campaigns for the U.S. Senate in 2002, 2008, and 2014. He joined the Los Angeles Times as a columnist in 2019.\nJennings is on the speaking circuit, briefing groups on the political landscape and taking part in panel discussions.[7] He was a resident fellow at Harvard Institute of Politics in 2018, and became an adjunct lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School in 2019. He is also heard frequently[8] on NPR's Morning Edition as a conservative political analyst.\n\n\nPersonal[edit]\nJennings is married to Autumn Stiff Jennings of Whitesville, Kentucky; they have four children and live in Prospect, Kentucky.\n\nCareer[edit]\nJennings served as political director for President Bush's 2000 Kentucky campaign, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in his 2002 re-election campaign, Gov. Ernie Fletcher in his 2003 campaign, and managed President Bush's campaign in New Mexico in 2004, before joining the White House. New Mexico was one of only two states to flip from blue to red in between 2000 and 2004; the other was Iowa. He served as associate director in the Office of Political Affairs at the White House before being named special assistant to the president in October 2005.[9]\nAfter leaving the White House, Scott Jennings became Director of Strategic Development and Senior Strategist for Peritus Public Relations in Louisville, KY, before co-founding RunSwitch PR in Louisville in 2012.  Jennings is frequently quoted by media outlets as a political analyst. During the 2016 presidential election, he appeared frequently on the Fox News Channel and other outlets as a commentator discussing polling and the political news of the day.\nIn 2017, Jennings joined CNN[10] as an on-air contributor. He has made hundreds of appearances on the network on AC360 with Anderson Cooper, The Lead with Jake Tapper, CNN Tonight with Don Lemon and other programs.\nIn 2022, Jennings launched the podcast \"Flyover Country with Scott Jennings,\" which features commentary on local, state, and national political issues as well as interviews with Sen. Mitch McConnell, Attorney General Daniel Cameron, commentator Erick Erickson and others.\n\nBush 2004 Campaign in New Mexico[edit]\nAfter losing New Mexico to Al Gore in 2000 by just 366 votes, President Bush's reelection campaign dispatched Jennings to manage its operations there. Jennings arrived in early 2004 to find a divided state Republican Party.[11] Shortly after his arrival, the state party chairman, State Senator Ramsay Gorham, resigned both her chairmanship and legislative seat and moved out of the state.  Jennings and Republican Party counterpart Jay McCleskey set about repairing the damaged party, recruiting 15,000 volunteers[12][13] to execute a grassroots strategy that relied heavily on peer-to-peer, coalition-based activity.  The Democratic establishment spent millions of dollars in the state through the Kerry for President Campaign, the state Democratic Party, and through a host of third-party organizations such as American Coming Together and Moveon.org.[14]  Bush won the New Mexico election by 5,988 votes, making it one of the closest states in the nation. Along with only Iowa, New Mexico flipped from Democrat to Republican between 2000 and 2004.[citation needed]\n\nPolitical Operations in Kentucky[edit]\nBetween 2000 and 2003, Jennings directed the political operations for George W. Bush's presidential campaign, Senator Mitch McConnell's reelection campaign, and Ernie Fletcher's gubernatorial campaign. Bush defeated Al Gore in Kentucky, a state Bill Clinton won twice, with 56.5%,[15] McConnell set a record by scoring 65 percent in his campaign,[16] and Fletcher became the first Republican governor in Kentucky in over 30 years by winning 55 percent of the vote.[17] Jennings resumed his work in Kentucky in 2008, helping U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell, Congressman Brett Guthrie, and state legislative Republicans win their races.\nIn 2019, Jennings made television and radio ads for Attorney General Daniel Cameron,[18] the first stand-alone African-American candidate to win statewide office in Kentucky.[19]\n\nGSA Hatch Act Inquiry[edit]\nIn 2007, Jennings was mentioned in an inquiry into the politicization of the General Services Administration (GSA).  At a Congressional hearing, witnesses testified that on January 26, 2007, Jennings was present at a meeting where GSA Administrator Lurita Doan \"joined in a video conference earlier this year with top GSA political appointees, who discussed ways to help Republican candidates.\"[20]  On April 23, 2007, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) announced it was investigating the January video conference, to look at whether the political dealings of the White House had violated the Hatch Act.[21]\nWhile the OSC found that Doan violated the Hatch Act, Elaine Kaplan, Special Counsel during the Clinton Administration, said that \"nothing in the OSC's investigative report suggests that anything improper had occurred before Doan initiated the discussion.\"[22] Jennings' presentation was similar in nature to several others disclosed by the White House. Special Counsel Scott Bloch told the Washington Post, \"Political forecasts, just generally . . . I do not regard as illegal political activity.\"[23]  White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino described the briefings to reporters: \"It's not unlawful and it wasn't unusual for informational briefings to be given. There is no prohibition under the Hatch Act of allowing political appointees to talk to other political appointees about the political landscape in which they are trying to advance the president's agenda.\"[24]\n\nDismissal of United States Attorneys Controversy[edit]\n\n\nDismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy\n\n\n\nTimeline\nSummary of attorneys\nCongressional hearings\nList of dismissed attorneys\nAll related articles\n\nJennings was involved in the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy in early 2007 testifying on August 2, 2007, before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He invoked executive privilege and refused to answer most questions, claiming the president George W. Bush had ordered his non-compliance.[25] Democrats on the committee contested the legitimacy of the privilege assertion, Patrick Leahy calling it, \"...a bogus claim.\"[25] E-mails published subsequently confirmed that Jennings was directly involved in the controversial firing of New Mexico US Attorney David Iglesias, Jennings writing in one e-mail to a White House staffer, \"Iglesias has done nothing,\" and to another, \"We are getting killed out there,\" adding that the White House \"move forward with getting rid of the NM USATTY.\"[26]\n\nWhite House and RNC Email Accounts[edit]\nMain article: Bush White House e-mail controversy\nIn the months leading up to the controversy around the dismissal of United States attorneys, Jennings communicated with Justice Department officials \"concerning the appointment of Tim Griffin, a former Karl Rove aide, as U.S. attorney in Little Rock, according to e-mails released [in March 2007]. For that exchange, Jennings, although working at the White House, used an e-mail account registered to the Republican National Committee (RNC), where Griffin had worked as a political opposition researcher.\"[20]\n\nInvolvement in 2014 U.S. Senate Election in Kentucky[edit]\nJennings ran a Super PAC known as Kentuckians for Strong Leadership that supported the re-election of Mitch McConnell during the 2014 U.S. Senate election in Kentucky. In July 2014, Jennings told WFPL \"I think the party is coming together just fine and I don't detect any problems for McConnell on GOP unity.\"[27]\nDuring the race, Jennings was profiled in The New Yorker magazine, which dubbed him \"the master of attack.\"[28] After the race, the Kentucky political news show \"Pure Politics\" interviewed Jennings and said that he had \"shaped the race in McConnell's favor.\"[29]\n\nInvolvement in 2016 Kentucky State Legislative Races[edit]\nIn 2016, Jennings' Super PAC, Kentuckians for Strong Leadership (KSL), sought to help Republicans gain control of the Kentucky House of Representatives. KSL spent $2 million on 19 legislative races as the GOP went from a 53-47 minority to a 64-36 super majority. \"Pure Politics\" credited KSL with helping the GOP achieve its objective.[30] The group created a stir in the closing days of the campaign by sending thousands of Hillary Clinton birthday cards to voters across the state, asking them to \"ruin Hillary's birthday\" by voting against Clinton and \"every Clinton Democrat running.\"[31]\n\nColumnist for Louisville Courier-Journal and Gannet[edit]\nJennings became a contributing columnist to the Louisville Courier-Journal in 2013, writing a conservative column that appears every other Wednesday. Jennings's columns are frequently picked up by Gannett's flagship USA TODAY.[32] In Jennings' columns for the Louisville newspaper, he tackles policy and political issues affecting Kentucky and the nation. In 2018 and 2021,[33] Jennings won a Society of Professional Journalists award for his Courier-Journal writing.[34] Jennings' writing also appears occasionally on RealClearPolitics.[35]\n\nCNN[edit]\nIn June 2017, Jennings joined CNN as a political contributor, along with former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, former Kasich chief strategist John Weaver, former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli, Obama national security alum Shawn Turner and Yale Law School associate dean and former FBI special agent Asha Rangappa.\nAround that time, it was reported in various news outlets that he had been offered but turned down, a senior role in the Trump White House.[36]\n\nHarvard's Institute of Politics and Harvard Kennedy School[edit]\nJennings was named a resident fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School for the Spring 2018 semester. He taught a series of seminars on tribalism in American politics,[37] and attracted such guest lecturers to his class as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell[38] and former White House Chief of Staff and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.[39]\nIn 2019, Jennings returned to Harvard's Kennedy School to serve as an Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, teaching a course on modern American political campaigns.[40]\n\nLos Angeles Times[edit]\nJennings was named an LA Times contributing columnist in the Fall of 2019. His initial, unctuous column for the paper was called \"Attitude and Gratitude: Why Republicans Stick with Trump,\"[41] who had recently been impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives. He also wrote a column heralding Tiger Woods' remarkable 2019 Master's win.[42]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Alexis Simendinger (July 11, 2006). \"Who's Making What In The White House\".
