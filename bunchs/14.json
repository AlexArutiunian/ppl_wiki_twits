While at UCSC, he applied to write for City on a Hill Press but was rejected.[16] He said school was never a great fit for him academically or socially.[17]\n\nCareer[edit]\nKlein worked on Howard Dean's primary campaign in Vermont in 2003 and interned for the Washington Monthly in Washington, D.C., in 2004. \"The media is as effective and important an agent for change as the legislative bodies, and I think it's where I'm happiest and most effective,\" Klein said.[18] In 2003, he and Markos Moulitsas were two of the earliest bloggers to report from a political convention, that of the California State Democratic Party.[19] In 2006, Klein was one of several writers pseudonymously flamed by The New Republic writer Lee Siegel (posting as a sock puppet called sprezzatura).[20]\nOn December 10, 2007, Klein moved his blog full-time to The American Prospect.[8]\nKlein's prolific blogging caught the attention of Steven Pearlstein, The Washington Post's veteran business columnist. \"I was blown away by how good he was\u2014how much the kid wrote\u2014on so many subjects,\" Pearlstein said. Pearlstein sent samples of Klein's work to managing editor Raju Narisetti. A few weeks after he heard from Pearlstein, Washington Post foreign correspondent John Pomfret asked Klein to have lunch with him and financial editor Sandy Sugawara. Narisetti hired Klein to be the Post's first pure blogger on politics and economics.[7] On May 18, 2009, he began writing at the newspaper.[21]\nIn May 2011, when Bloomberg View launched, Klein became a columnist there in addition to his work at The Washington Post and MSNBC.[22]\nKlein announced he would be leaving The Washington Post in January 2014, with the intent to start a new media venture with several other veteran journalists.[23]\nThe new media venture was later identified as the politics site Vox.[24]\nKlein had previously \"proposed the creation of an independent, explanatory journalism website\u2014with more than three dozen staffers\" and an annual budget of more than US$10 million to remain at The Washington Post. During negotiations, Post publisher Katharine Weymouth and new owner Jeff Bezos did not make a counteroffer.[25]\nKlein was editor-in-chief at Vox, later editor-at-large, and formerly wrote for and edited Wonkblog at The Washington Post. He frequently provides political commentary on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, Hardball with Chris Matthews, and The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. He is a former contributor to Countdown with Keith Olbermann. On March 14, 2013, The Week magazine reported that Klein was among those being considered to host MSNBC's yet-unnamed 8 p.m. weekday prime-time show that would replace The Ed Show.[26] Ultimately, the time slot was filled with All In with Chris Hayes.\nIn October 2015, Klein, along with Sarah Kliff and Matt Yglesias, launched The Weeds, a Vox podcast of detailed discussions on public policy.[27] Klein also hosts the podcast The Ezra Klein Show.[28] Klein is an executive producer of Vox's Netflix series Explained, which debuted in 2018.[29][30]\nIn October 2019, Klein, along with other reporters from Vox Media, started the podcast Impeachment, Explained.[31] Klein joined the New York Times in 2020 and became one of their opinion columnists in 2021.[12][32] According to an analysis by British digital strategist Rob Blackie, Klein was one of the most commonly followed political writers among Biden administration staff on Twitter.[33]\n\nHealth care debate[edit]\nIn December 2009, Klein wrote an article in The Washington Post, stating that U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman was \"willing to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in order to settle an old electoral score\", because Lieberman \"was motivated to oppose health care legislation in part out of resentment at liberals for being defeated in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic Primary\".[34] Klein based his estimate on an Urban Institute report that estimated that 22,000 people died in 2006 because they lacked health insurance.[35] This article was criticized by Jonah Goldberg of the National Review, who called it a \"silly claim\".[36] Charles Lane, also of The Washington Post, described Klein's article as an \"outrageous smear\". But E. J. Dionne, also of The Washington Post, agreed with Klein's claim, saying that \"Klein is right that there is not a shred of principle in Lieberman's opposition.\"[37] Klein later said he regretted the phrasing[38] and his position is that despite universal coverage, the social determinants of health are still powerful predictors that, on average, ensure the lower socioeconomic classes die sooner than those with more income and education.[39][40]\n\nJournoList[edit]\nIn February 2007, Klein created a Google Groups forum called \"JournoList\" for discussing politics and the news media. The forum's membership was controlled by Klein and limited to \"several hundred left-leaning bloggers, political reporters, magazine writers, policy wonks and academics\".[41]\nPosts within JournoList were intended only to be made and read by its members.[42] Klein defended the forum saying that it \"[ensures] that folks feel safe giving off-the-cuff analysis and instant reactions\". JournoList member and Time magazine columnist Joe Klein (no relation to Ezra Klein) added that the off-the-record nature of the forum was necessary because \"candor is essential and can only be guaranteed by keeping these conversations private\".[41]\nThe existence of JournoList was first publicly revealed in a July 27, 2007, blog post by blogger Mickey Kaus.[43] However, the forum did not attract serious attention until March 17, 2009, when an article published on Politico detailed the nature of the forum and the extent of its membership.[41] The Politico article set off debate within the blogosphere over the ethics of participating in JournoList and raised questions about its purpose. The first public excerpt of a discussion within JournoList was posted by Mickey Kaus on his blog on March 26, 2009.[44]\nIn addition to Ezra Klein, membership of JournoList included Jeffrey Toobin, Eric Alterman, Paul Krugman, Joe Klein, Matthew Yglesias, and Jonathan Chait.[citation needed]\nOn June 25, 2010, Ezra Klein announced in his Washington Post blog that he would be terminating the JournoList group. This decision was instigated by fellow blogger Dave Weigel's resignation from the Post following the public exposure of several of his JournoList emails about conservative media figures.[45][46]\nKlein had justified excluding conservative Republicans from participation as \"not about fostering ideology but preventing a collapse into flame war. The emphasis is on empiricism, not ideology.\"[47]\n\nAwards[edit]\nIn 2010, he was named Blogger of the Year by The Week magazine and The Sidney Hillman Foundation.[48][49] In 2011, he was named one of the 50 most powerful people in Washington, D.C., by GQ.[50] His blog was also named one of the 25 best financial blogs by Time magazine in 2011.[51] In 2013, Klein won the Online News Association Award for Best Online Commentary.[52] He also won the American Political Science Association's Carey McWilliams Award,[53] for \"a major journalistic contribution to our understanding of politics\". He appeared as one of 80 men featured in Esquire's 80th anniversary issue[54] and in a feature in T magazine.[55]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nKlein is married to Annie Lowrey,[56] an economic policy reporter at The Atlantic.[57] They have two children, the first born in February 2019 and the second in fall 2021.[58] Klein is vegan.[59]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nWhy We're Polarized.

He is the host of CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS and writes a weekly paid column for The Washington Post.[2] He has been a columnist for Newsweek, editor of Newsweek International, and an editor at large of Time.[3]\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nZakaria was born in Mumbai, India, to a Konkani Muslim family.[4][5] His father, Rafiq Zakaria (1920\u20132005), was a politician associated with the Indian National Congress and an Islamic theologian. His mother, Fatima Zakaria  (1936\u20132021), his father's second wife, was for a time the editor of the Sunday Times of India. She died during the COVID-19 pandemic.[6]\nZakaria attended the Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Yale University in 1986,[3] where he was president of the Yale Political Union, editor in chief of the Yale Political Monthly, a member of the Scroll and Key society, and a member of the  Party of the Right. He later gained a PhD in government from Harvard University in 1993,[3] where he studied under Samuel P. Huntington and Stanley Hoffmann, as well as international relations theorist Robert Keohane.[7]\n\nCareer[edit]\nAfter directing a research project on American foreign policy at Harvard, Zakaria became the managing editor of Foreign Affairs in 1992, at the age of 28. Under his guidance, the magazine was redesigned to be published once every two months, moving away from a quarterly schedule. He served as an adjunct professor at Columbia University, where he taught a seminar on international relations. In October 2000, he was named editor of Newsweek International,[3] and became a weekly columnist for Newsweek. In August 2010, he moved to Time to serve as editor at-large and columnist.[8] He writes a weekly column for The Washington Post and is a contributing editor for the Atlantic Media group, which includes The Atlantic Monthly.\nHe has published on a variety of subjects for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, The New Republic. For a brief period, he was a wine columnist for the web magazine Slate, with the pseudonym of George Saintsbury, after the English writer.[9][10][11]\nZakaria is the author of From Wealth to Power: The Unusual Origins of America's World Role (Princeton, 1998), The Future of Freedom (Norton, 2003), The Post-American World (2008), and In Defense of a Liberal Education (Norton, 2015). He co-edited The American Encounter: The United States and the Making of the Modern World (Basic Books) with James F. Hoge Jr. His last three books have both been New York Times bestsellers and The Future of Freedom and The Post American World have both been translated into more than 25 languages. In 2011 an updated and expanded edition of The Post-American World (\"Release 2.0\") was published.\nZakaria was a news analyst with ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos (2002\u20132007) where he was a member of the Sunday morning roundtable. He hosted the weekly TV news show, Foreign Exchange with Fareed Zakaria on PBS (2005\u201308). His weekly show, Fareed Zakaria GPS (Global Public Square), premiered on CNN in June 2008.[3] It airs twice weekly in the United States and four times weekly on CNN International, reaching over 200 million homes. It celebrated its 10th anniversary on 5 June 2018, as announced on the weekly foreign affairs show on CNN.\nIn 2013, he became one of the producers for the HBO series Vice, for which he serves as a consultant.\nZakaria, a member of the Berggruen Institute, additionally features as an interlocutor for the annual Berggruen Prize.[12][13][14]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nZakaria self-identifies as a \"centrist\",[15] though he has been described variously as a political liberal,[16] a conservative,[17] a moderate,[18] or a radical centrist.[19] George Stephanopoulos said of him in 2003, \"He's so well versed in politics, and he can't be pigeonholed. I can't be sure whenever I turn to him where he's going to be coming from or what he's going to say.\"[17] In February 2008, Zakaria wrote that \"Conservatism grew powerful in the 1970s and 1980s because it proposed solutions appropriate to the problems of the age\", adding that \"a new world requires new thinking\".[20] He supported Barack Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary campaign and also for president. In January 2009, Forbes referred to Zakaria as one of the 25 most influential liberals in the American media.[16] Zakaria has stated that he tries not to be devoted to any type of ideology, saying \"I feel that's part of my job... which is not to pick sides but to explain what I think is happening on the ground. I can't say, 'This is my team and I'm going to root for them no matter what they do.'\"[15]\n\nFareed Zakaria at World Economic Forum 2006, Davos, Switzerland (second from the right)\nAs a student at Yale University in the mid-1980s, Zakaria opposed anti-apartheid divestment and argued that Yale should not divest from its holdings in South Africa.[21]\nZakaria \"may have more intellectual range and insights than any other public thinker in the West,\" wrote David Shribman in The Boston Globe.[22] In 2003, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told New York Magazine that Zakaria \"has a first-class mind and likes to say things that run against conventional wisdom.\"[17] However, in 2011, the editors of The New Republic included him in a list of \"over-rated thinkers\" and commented, \"There's something suspicious about a thinker always so perfectly in tune with the moment.\"[23]\nZakaria's books include The Future of Freedom and The Post-American World. The Future of Freedom argues that what is defined as democracy in the Western world is actually \"liberal democracy\", a combination of constitutional liberalism and participatory politics. Zakaria points out that protection of liberty and the rule of law actually preceded popular elections by centuries in Western Europe, and that when countries only adopt elections without the protection of liberty, they create \"illiberal democracy\". The Post-American World, published in 2008 before the financial crisis, argued that the most important trend of modern times is the \"rise of the rest,\" the economic emergence of China, India, Brazil, and other countries.[24]\nFrom 2006, Zakaria has also criticized what he views as \"fear-based\" American policies employed not only in combating terrorism, but also in enforcing immigration and drug smuggling laws, and has argued in favor of decriminalization of drugs and citizenship for presently illegal immigrants to the United States of all backgrounds.[25][26][27]\nReferring to his views on Iran, Leon Wieseltier described Zakaria in 2010 as a \"consummate spokesman for the shibboleths of the [Obama] White House and for the smooth new worldliness, the at-the-highest-levels impatience with democracy and human rights as central objectives of our foreign policy, that now characterize advanced liberal thinking about America's role in the world.\"[28]\nBefore the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Zakaria endorsed Barack Obama on his CNN program.[29] In May 2011 The New York Times reported that President Obama has \"sounded out prominent journalists like Fareed Zakaria ... and Thomas L. Friedman\" concerning Middle East issues.[30]\n\nFareed Zakaria and Vladimir Putin at St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, 17 June 2016\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, in a Newsweek cover essay, \"Why They Hate Us,\" Zakaria argued that Islamic extremism was not fundamentally rooted in Islam, nor could it be claimed a reaction to American foreign policy. He located the problem in the political-social-economic stagnation of Arab societies, which then bred an extreme, religious opposition. He portrayed Osama bin Laden as one in a long line of extremists who used religion to justify mass murder. Zakaria argued for an intergenerational effort to create more open and dynamic societies in Arab countries, and thereby helping Islam enter the modern world.[31]\nZakaria initially supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[17] He said at the time, \"The place is so dysfunctional ... any stirring of the pot is good. America's involvement in the region is for the good.\"[17] He argued for a United Nations\u2013sanctioned operation with a much larger force\u2014approximately 400,000 troops\u2014than was actually employed by the administration of President George W. Bush. However, he soon became a critic. In addition to objecting to the war plan, he frequently criticized the way the Bush administration was running the occupation of Iraq.[32] He argued against the disbanding of the army and bureaucracy yet supported the de-Baathification programs.[33] He continued to argue that a functioning democracy in Iraq would be a powerful new model for Arab politics but suggested that an honest accounting would have to say that the costs of the invasion had been much higher than the benefits. He opposed the Iraq surge in March 2007, writing that it would work militarily but not politically, still leaving Iraq divided among its three communities. Instead, he advocated that Washington push hard for a political settlement between the Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, and Kurds, and begin a reduction in forces to only 60,000 troops.[32] He later wrote that the surge \"succeeded\" militarily but that it did not produce a political compact and that Iraq remained divided along sectarian lines, undermining its unity, democracy, and legacy.[34][35]\nZakaria supported the April 2017 U.S. missile strike against a Syrian government\u2013controlled airbase. Zakaria praised President Trump's strike and said it was the moment \"[he] became president of the United States.\"[36]\nIn July 2020, Zakaria was one of the 153 signers of the \"Harper's Letter\" (also known as \"A Letter on Justice and Open Debate\") that expressed concern that \"the free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is dally becoming more constricted.\"[37]\nIn March 2021, Zakaria criticized the size of the U.S. military budget, saying that \"The United States\u2019 F-35 fighter jet program, bedeviled by cost overruns and technical problems, will ultimately cost taxpayers $1.7 trillion. China will spend a comparable amount of money on its Belt and Road Initiative...Which is money better spent?\".[38]\nIn July 2022, Zakaria wrote a Washington Post article titled \"Forget pronouns. Democrats need to become the party of building things\", in which he said \"There is plenty of evidence that the Democratic Party has moved left, that it is out of sync with Americans on many of these cultural issues, and that it needs to correct course\" and that \"This is not a perception problem. It is a reality problem. Democrats need to once more become the party that gets stuff done, builds things and makes government work for people. That\u2019s a lot more important to most Americans than using the right pronouns\".[39]\n\nHonors and awards[edit]\nZakaria has been nominated five times for the National Magazine Award, and won it once, for his columns and commentary.[citation needed] His show has won a Peabody Award[40] and been nominated for several Emmys. He was conferred India Abroad Person of the Year 2008 award on 20 March 2009, in New York.[41] Filmmaker Mira Nair, who won the award for year 2007, honored her successor.\nHe has received honorary degrees from Harvard University, Brown University, Duke University, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Miami, Oberlin College, Bates College, and the University of Oklahoma among others.[42] He was the 2000 Annual Orator of the Philomathean Society of the University of Pennsylvania.[citation needed]\nIn January 2010, Zakaria was given the Padma Bhushan award by the Indian government for his contribution to the field of journalism.[43]\nHe has served on the boards of the Council on Foreign Relations, Columbia University's International House, City College of New York's Colin Powell School for Civic and Global Leadership,[44] among others.[citation needed] He was a trustee of Yale Corporation, the governing body of Yale University[45] and the Trilateral Commission.[citation needed]\nIn 2020, Zakaria was awarded the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) Founders Award for Excellence in Journalism.[46]\n\nControversies[edit]\nRole in the 2003 invasion of Iraq[edit]\nIn his 2006 book State of Denial, journalist Bob Woodward of The Washington Post described a 29 November 2001 meeting of Middle East analysts, including Zakaria, that was convened at the request of the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. According to a story in The New York Times on Woodward's book, the Wolfowitz meeting ultimately produced a report for President George W. Bush that supported the subsequent invasion of Iraq. Zakaria, however, later told The New York Times that he had briefly attended what he thought was \"a brainstorming session\".[47] He was not told that a report would be prepared for the President, and in fact, the report did not have his name on it. The Times issued a correction.[48]\n\nDebate on the Park51 Islamic Center[edit]\nIn 2010, in protest at the Anti-Defamation League's opposition to the building of the Park51 mosque and Islamic cultural center two blocks from the World Trade Center site, Zakaria returned the Hubert H. Humphrey First Amendment Freedoms Prize awarded to him by the ADL in 2005. He declared that the ADL's opposition to the mosque meant that he could not \"in good conscience keep [the award] anymore\". In support of his decision, he stated that the larger issue in the controversy is freedom of religion in the United States, even while acknowledging that he is not a religious person. He also wrote that a \"moderate, mainstream version of Islam\" is essential to winning the war on terror, and that moves like the ADL's make it harder for such a moderate version of Islam to emerge and thrive.[49][50][51] On 8 August 2010, edition of Fareed Zakaria GPS, Zakaria addressed the issue, stating that in returning his award, he had hoped that the ADL would reconsider their stance.[52]\n\nPlagiarism allegations[edit]\nFareed Zakaria in 2013\nZakaria was suspended for a week in August 2012 while Time and CNN investigated an allegation of plagiarism[53] involving a 20 August column on gun control with similarities to a New Yorker article by Jill Lepore. In a statement Zakaria apologized, saying that he had made \"a terrible mistake.\"[54][55][56] Six days later, after a review of his research notes and years of prior commentary, Time and CNN reinstated Zakaria. Time described the incident as \"isolated\" and \"unintentional\"; and CNN \"... found nothing that merited continuing the suspension....\"[57][58][59]\nThe controversy was reignited in September 2014, when Esquire and The Week magazines reported on allegations made in pseudonymous blogs.[60][61][62] Newsweek added a blanket warning to its archive of articles penned by Zakaria, and after an investigation of his several hundred columns for the magazine, found improper citation in seven.[63][64] Similarly, after allegations surfaced on Twitter regarding the originality of one of Zakaria's columns for Slate, the online magazine appended a notice to the article indicating that, \"This piece does not meet Slate's editorial standards, having failed to properly attribute quotations and information...\".[65] However, Slate Editor-in-Chief Jacob Weisberg, who had, months before, exchanged barbs with one of the aforementioned anonymous bloggers on Twitter in defense of Zakaria,[66] maintained his original position that what Zakaria did was not plagiarism.[67]\nCorrections to selected Zakaria columns were also issued by The Washington Post, which had responded to the initial allegations by telling the Poynter media industry news site that it would investigate.[68] Later on the same day, 10 November, the Post said that it had found \"problematic\" sourcing in five Zakaria columns, \"and will likely note the lack of attribution in archived editions of the articles.\"[69] However, editors at The Washington Post and Newsweek denied that Zakaria's errors constituted plagiarism.[67]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nZakaria is a naturalized citizen of the United States.[70] In 1997, Zakaria married Paula Throckmorton, a jewelry designer. The couple have three children. In July 2018, his wife filed for divorce.[71]\nHe lives on the Upper West Side in New York City.[72] As a graduate student, Zakaria fostered a love for cooking and credits chefs Jacques P\u00e9pin and Julia Child with his greater interest in food.[72][11] Zakaria is a self-described secular and nonpracticing Muslim. He added: \"My views on faith are complicated\u2014somewhere between deism and agnosticism. I am completely secular in my outlook.\" His ex-wife is a Christian and his three children have not been raised as Muslims.[73][74]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nThe American Encounter: The United States and the Making of the Modern World Essays from 75 Years of Foreign Affairs, edited by James F.

    "wiki": "American journalist and author\nFarhad ManjooFarhad Manjoo in 2008Born1978 (age\u00a045\u201346)South AfricaOccupationJournalist, authorLanguageEnglishNationalityAmericanEducationCornell University\nFarhad Manjoo (born 1978) is an American journalist. Manjoo was a staff writer for Slate magazine from 2008 to September 2013, when they left to join The Wall Street Journal.[1] In January 2014, they joined The New York Times, replacing David Pogue as the technology columnist.[2] Manjoo became an opinion columnist at the paper in 2018.[3] They have also been a contributor to National Public Radio since 2009.[4]\n\n\nEarly and personal life[edit]\nManjoo was born in South Africa in 1978 to a family with ancestral roots in India. The family left South Africa when Manjoo was eight years old,[5] and moved to Southern California.[1] Manjoo graduated from Cornell University in 2000. As an undergraduate, Manjoo served as writer and editor-in-chief of the Cornell Daily Sun student newspaper.[1]\nManjoo, self-described in the New York Times as a \u201cstereotypical, cisgender, middle-aged suburban dad,\u201d stated in 2019 that they prefer to be referred to with singular they pronouns.[6] Manjoo publicly disclosed their struggle with esophageal achalasia in 2019.[7]\n\nCareer[edit]\nManjoo wrote for Wired News before taking a staff position at Salon.com. In July 2008, they accepted a job at Slate magazine writing a twice-weekly technology column. In September 2013, they joined The Wall Street Journal as a technology columnist;[1] their final column for Slate, urging men to wear makeup, was published on September 20.[8] They moved to The New York Times in 2014, and left in 2023.\nManjoo has written about technology, new media,[9] politics,[10] and controversies in journalism.[11]\nThey are the author of the book True Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society.[12][13][14]\nThey shared the 2018 Gerald Loeb Award for Breaking News for the story \"Ouster at Uber.\"[15]\nIn March 2018, they published a column in the Times about a personal experiment in getting most of their news from print sources for two months.[16] The piece drew criticism from the Columbia Journalism Review[17] and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism[18] for the article's assertion Manjoo had \"unplugged from Twitter\" for this period when in fact they continued to use the social media service every day. Manjoo felt the piece was sufficiently clear that they made exceptions to their \"unplugged\" policy, and The New York Times stood by the piece.[17] WNYC's On the Media removed a segment with Manjoo discussing the experiment.[19][20]\nIn April 2021, their column \"Let's Quit Fetishizing the Single-Family Home\" was used for the Abitur high school leaving exams in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.[21][22]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d \"Manjoo Joins Wall Street Journal as Technology Columnist\".

    "wiki": "American journalist, writer, and professor\nFrank BruniBornFrank Anthony Bruni (1964-10-31) October 31, 1964 (age\u00a059)White Plains, New York, U.S.EducationUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (BA)Columbia University (MS)Occupation(s)Op-ed columnist, The New York Times; former chief restaurant criticNotable creditThe New York Times\nFrank Anthony Bruni (born October 31, 1964) is an American journalist and long-time writer for The New York Times. In June 2011, he was named an op-ed columnist for the newspaper. His columns appear twice weekly and he also writes a weekly newsletter. In April 2021, Times Opinion Editor Kathleen Kingsbury announced that Bruni would be stepping down from his role as a columnist and joining Duke University in June 2021 as Professor of the Practice of Journalism and Public Policy in the Sanford School of Public Policy.[1][2] Since joining Duke, he has continued to write his Times newsletter and remains a contributing opinion writer for the newspaper.\nOne of his many previous posts for the newspaper was as its chief restaurant critic, from 2004 to 2009. He is the author of three bestselling books: Born Round, a memoir about his family's love of food and his own struggles with overeating;  Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be, about college admissions;[3] and Ambling Into History, about George W. Bush.\n\n\nEducation[edit]\nBruni was educated at the Loomis Chaffee School,[4] an independent boarding and day college preparatory school in Windsor, Connecticut, followed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, from which he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1986 with a B.A. in English. He was a Morehead Scholar and wrote for the student paper, The Daily Tar Heel.[5] He then attended Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, from which he graduated second in his class with a master of science degree in journalism, and also won a Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship.\n\nLife and career[edit]\nAfter graduating from Columbia, Bruni joined the staff of the New York Post and then moved on to the Detroit Free Press, where he did a wide range of beats, including a stint covering the Persian Gulf War. He spent more than a year as the movie critic and also wrote extensively about LGBT issues and AIDS. In 1992,[6] he was a runner-up for the Pulitzer Prize in feature writing for his profile of a convicted child molester. In 1995, Bruni took a job with The New York Times as a metropolitan reporter and often wrote for the Times' Sunday magazine and for Sunday Arts & Leisure.\nIn 1998, he was assigned to the Washington, D.C., bureau, where he covered Capitol Hill and Congress, before being sent on the campaign trail to follow then-Texas Governor George W. Bush. He then covered the White House for the first eight months of the Bush administration and served as the Washington-based staff writer for the Sunday magazine. In July 2002, he was promoted to Rome bureau chief. Two years later, he became the Times' restaurant critic. After more than five years in that position, he returned briefly to the magazine before becoming an op-ed columnist. In the spring of 2014, he taught a journalism seminar at Princeton University.[7] In 2016, the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association gave him its Randy Shilts Award for his career-long contribution to LGBT Americans. He was previously awarded the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Newspaper Columnist in 2012 and 2013.[8]\nBruni's book Ambling into History chronicles his time covering Bush's campaign. Born Round[9] deals in part with his time as the Times' restaurant critic and was named one of the best nonfiction books of 2009 by The New York Times, Publishers Weekly, The Washington Post and Amazon.com. In the Times' Sunday Book Review, Dominique Browning raved that \"the love with which Bruni writes about his family is breathtaking.\" Publishers Weekly deemed Born Round a \"powerful, honest book about desire, shame, identity and self-image.\"\nWhere You Go Is Not Who You'll Be was published by Grand Central Publishing, an imprint of the Hachette Book Group, in March 2015 and was reissued in an expanded, updated paperback a year later. In a review of it in The Washington Post,[10] Wesleyan University President Michael Roth called it \"a humane, measured book\" with \"lessons for a very wide audience indeed.\" In February 2017, Bruni released his first cookbook, written with his Times colleague Jennifer Steinhauer titled A Meatloaf in Every Oven. It includes recipes from such prominent chefs as Bobby Flay and April Bloomfield.\nBruni has also done extensive reporting on religion and is the author, with Elinor Burkett, of A Gospel of Shame: Children, Sexual Abuse and the Catholic Church. His freelance work has appeared in several magazines, including Conde Nast Traveler. Although he formalized a relationship with CNN in September 2017 and appears on its shows as a commentator about four times a week, he also appears occasionally on Real Time with Bill Maher, and has been a guest on late-night talk shows as well. He once served as a guest judge on Top Chef and appeared briefly in the movie Julie & Julia, which was written and directed by his friend Nora Ephron.\nIn February 2018, he published a long and unusually personal column for the Times about an affliction that, overnight, robbed him of functional vision in his right eye. He described the difficult adjustment to that and what it's like to live with the fear of his left eye being affected, too. His memoir, The Beauty of Dusk, published by Simon & Schuster, reflects further on the experience and discusses aging and physical limitations among Baby Boomers who once thought themselves invincible.[11]\nBruni's last regularly scheduled opinion column for The New York Times appeared on June 17, 2021.[12] and he was awarded the Thomas Wolfe Prize [13]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBruni is openly gay.[14] He has struggled with eating disorders, including bulimia.[5][15] Bruni relocated from New York City's Upper West Side neighborhood to North Carolina in 2021.[16]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nThe Beauty of Dusk: On Vision Lost and Found, 2022\nA Meatloaf in Every Oven: Two Chatty Cooks, One Iconic Dish and Dozens of Recipes, 2017 with Jennifer Steinhauer\nWhere You Go Is Not Who You'll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania, 2015\nBorn Round: The Secret History of a Full-Time Eater, 2009\n* Ambling Into History: The Unlikely Odyssey of George W.
