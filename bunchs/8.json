Amanpour is the Chief International Anchor for CNN and host of CNN International's nightly interview program Amanpour and CNN's The Amanpour Hour on Saturdays. She is also the host of Amanpour & Company on PBS.[3]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nAmanpour was born in the West London suburb of Ealing, the daughter of Mohammad Taghi Amanpour (Iranian) and  Anne Patricia Hill (British).[1][4]  She was baptized at the Church of Saint Benedict in Ealing and was raised in Tehran until the age of eleven. [5][6] Her father was Shia Muslim and her mother was Roman Catholic.[1]\nHer father worked as an airline executive for Iran Air and later lost his job and fortune after the Iran Revolution in 1979. After completing the more significant part of her primary school education in Iran, her parents sent her to a boarding school in England when she was 11. She attended the Convent of the Holy Cross, an all-girls preparatory school in Chalfont Saint Peter, Buckinghamshire, and then, at the age of 16, she attended New Hall School, a Roman Catholic school in Chelmsford, Essex. Christiane and her family returned to England shortly after the Islamic Revolution began. She maintains that they were not forced to leave the country but were returning to England due to the Iran\u2013Iraq War. The family ultimately remained in England, finding it difficult to return to Iran.[7]\nAfter leaving New Hall, Amanpour moved to the United States to study journalism at the University of Rhode Island. During her time there, she worked in the news department at WBRU-FM in Providence, Rhode Island. She also worked for NBC affiliate WJAR in Providence as an electronic graphics designer.[8]\nIn 1983, Amanpour graduated from the university summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa[9] with a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism.[10] In 2007, she received the Commander badge (No. 3) of the Order of the British Empire for her journalism work.\n\nCareer[edit]\n1983\u20132010: CNN[edit]\nIn 1983, Amanpour was hired by CNN on the foreign desk in Atlanta, Georgia, as an entry-level desk assistant. During her early years as a correspondent, she was given her first major assignment covering the Iran\u2013Iraq War, followed by a transfer in 1986 to Eastern Europe to report on the fall of European communism.[11] In 1989, she was assigned to work in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany, where she reported on the democratic revolutions sweeping Eastern Europe at the time. By 1990, she served as a correspondent for CNN's New York bureau.[12]\nFollowing Iraq's occupation of Kuwait in 1990, Amanpour's reports of the Persian Gulf War brought her wide notice while also taking CNN to a new level of news coverage.[buzzword] Thereafter, she reported from the Bosnian war and other conflict zones. While in Bosnia, she interviewed Serb general Ratko Mladic, who would later be convicted of genocide. Because of her emotional delivery from Sarajevo during the Siege of Sarajevo, viewers and critics questioned her professional objectivity, claiming that many of her reports were unjustified and favored the Bosnian Muslims, to which she replied:\n\n\"There are some situations one simply cannot be neutral about, because when you are neutral, you are an accomplice. Objectivity doesn't mean treating all sides equally. It means giving each side a hearing.\"[13]\nAmanpour gained a reputation for being fearless during the Gulf and Bosnian wars for reporting from conflict areas.[14]\nFrom 1992 to 2010, Amanpour was CNN's chief international correspondent. From 2009 to 2010, she was the anchor of Amanpour, a daily CNN interview program. Amanpour has reported on major crises from many of the world's hotspots, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Somalia, Rwanda, and the Balkans and from the United States during Hurricane Katrina. She has secured exclusive interviews with world leaders from the Middle East to Europe, Africa and beyond, including Iranian presidents Mohammad Khatami and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as well as the presidents of Afghanistan, Sudan, and Syria, among others.[citation needed] After 9/11, she was the first international correspondent to interview British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac, and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. Other interviewees have included Hillary Clinton, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Hassan Rouhani, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, John Kerry, the Dalai Lama, Robert Mugabe and Moammar Gadhafi.[15]\nShe has also conducted interviews with Constantine II of Greece, Reza Pahlavi, Ameera al-Taweel and actors Angelina Jolie, Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep.[16]\nFrom 1996 to 2005, she was contracted by 60 Minutes creator Don Hewitt to file four to five in-depth international news reports a year as a special contributor. These reports garnered her a Peabody Award in 1998[17] (she had earlier been awarded one in 1993[18]). Hewitt's successor Jeff Fager terminated her contract.\n\nBosnian War reporting[edit]\nOn 9 October 1994, Stephen Kinzer of The New York Times criticized Amanpour's general coverage of the Bosnian War. Kinzer quoted a colleague's description of Amanpour as she reported on a terrorist bombing in the Markale marketplace of the Bosnian city of Sarajevo:\n\n[Christiane Amanpour] was sitting in Belgrade when that marketplace massacre happened, and she went on air to say that the Serbs had probably done it. There was no way she could have known that. She assumed an omniscience that no journalist has.[19]\nAmanpour has responded to the criticism leveled on her reporting from the war in the former Yugoslavia for \"lack of neutrality\", stating:\n\nSome people accused me of being pro\u2013Muslim in Bosnia, but I realized that our job is to give all sides an equal hearing, but in cases of genocide, you can't just be neutral. You can't just say, \"Well, this little boy was shot in the head and killed in besieged Sarajevo and that guy over there did it, but maybe he was upset because he argued with his wife.\" No, there is no equality, and we had to tell the truth.[20]\nIn 2019, retired commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Saeed Qassemi spoke of his and his comrades' participation as combatants in the Bosnian War, with him having been disguised as staff of the Iranian Red Crescent Society. Shortly after, in April 2019, Qassemi claimed that Amanpour had uncovered their deception.[21]\n\n2010\u20132012: ABC News[edit]\nOn 18 March 2010, Amanpour announced she would leave CNN for ABC News, where she would anchor This Week. She said, \"I'm thrilled to be joining the incredible team at ABC News. Being asked to anchor This Week in the superb tradition started by David Brinkley is a tremendous and rare honor, and I look forward to discussing the great domestic and international issues of the day. I leave CNN with the utmost respect, love, and admiration for the company and everyone who works here. This has been my family and shared endeavor for the past 27 years, and I am forever grateful and proud of all that we have accomplished.\"[22] She hosted her first broadcast on 1 August 2010.\nDuring her first two months as host, the ratings for This Week reached their lowest point since 2003.[23] On 28 February 2011, she interviewed Muammar Gaddafi and his sons Saif al-Islam and Al-Saadi Gaddafi.[24][25]\nOn 13 December 2011, ABC announced Amanpour would be leaving her post as anchor of ABC News' This Week on 8 January 2012 and returning to CNN International, where she had previously worked for 27 years and maintained a reporting role at ABC News.[26]\n\n2012\u2013present: Return to CNN[edit]\nWith U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Vienna, Austria, on 14 July 2015\nA day later on 14 December 2011, in statements by ABC and CNN, it was announced that in a \"unique arrangement\", Amanpour would begin hosting a program on CNN International in 2012 while continuing at ABC News as a global affairs anchor.[27]\nIt was later revealed that in the spring of 2012, CNN International would refresh its line-up, putting the interview show Amanpour back on air.[28] On-air promotions said she would return to CNN International on 16 April. Her 30-minute New York-recorded show \u2013 to be screened twice an evening \u2013 would mean that the US parent network's Piers Morgan Tonight interview show would be \"bumped\" out of its 9:00\u00a0p.m. (Central European Time) slot to midnight (CET).[29]\nOn 9 September 2013, the show and staff were moved to the CNN International office and the show is currently being produced and broadcast from London.\nOn 7 January 2015, Amanpour made headlines during a \"Breaking News\" segment on CNN by referring to the Islamic extremists who murdered the 12 journalists at Charlie Hebdo as \"activists\": \"On this day, these activists found their targets, and their targets were journalists. This was a clear attack on the freedom of expression, on the press, and on satire\".[30]\nOn 28 January 2019, Christiane Amanpour and Mary Ellen Schmider and Manfred Philipp gave the Fulbright Prize for International Understanding to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.[31]\n\nAmanpour interviewing Secretary of Defense Mark Esper in 2019, in front of a wing-mount ram air turbine\nOn 12 November 2020, Amanpour compared the Trump administration to the Nazis and Kristallnacht, saying, \"It was the Nazis' warning shot across the bow of our human civilization that led to genocide against a whole identity, and in that tower of burning books, it led to an attack on fact, knowledge, history and truth. After four years of a modern-day assault on those same values by Donald Trump, the Biden-Harris team pledges a return to norms, including the truth.\" The Israeli government, along with some Jewish groups, called for Amanpour to apologize for this comparison. Israeli Diaspora Affairs Minister Omer Yankelevich urged an \"immediate and public apology\" for \"belittling of the immense tragedy of the Holocaust.\"[32][33][34]\n\nRefusal to wear a headcovering[edit]\nIn September 2022, Amanpour terminated a scheduled TV interview with President of Iran Ebrahim Raisi in New York City during the seventy-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly, following a last\u2013minute demand that she wear a Chador headscarf while filming.[35] Amanpour vehemently responded that she could not agree to the \"unprecedented and unexpected condition\" and later reflected on the controversial situation, declaring that:\n\nHere in New York City, or anywhere else outside of Iran, I have never been asked by any Iranian president \u2015 and I have interviewed every single one of them since 1995 \u2015 either inside or outside of Iran, never been asked to wear a head scarf.[36][37][38]\nOn Syria[edit]\nIn late 2013, Amanpour raised the argument for intervention in Syria against the Assad government, which has been fighting against Syrian opposition forces. She has appeared on several news programs in the UK in which she criticized the Obama administration for its non-interventionist approach to Syria.\n\nPBS[edit]\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Amanpour would permanently replace Charlie Rose on PBS after he was fired due to allegations of sexual misconduct.[39] Her new program, Amanpour & Company, premiered on PBS on 10 September 2018.[40] From the time of Charlie Rose's departure from PBS until the new show premiered, Amanpour was aired on PBS stations, as Amanpour on PBS.\nIn 2020, Christiane Amanpour was doing the PBS daily program, Amanpour & Company, from her home in England, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her program continues to be seen on television on PBS at many stations in various areas of the US, including at least four TV stations in the greater Los Angeles region of southern California.\n\nControversies[edit]\nIn April 2023, Amanpour misspoke and said that Lucy, Maia and Rina Dee had been killed in a \"shootout\" instead of a \"shooting,\" while the family was travelling in a car in the West Bank. Amanpour contacted the father of the family to personally apologise for misspeaking and subsequently did the same on her show.[41][42]\n\nAffiliations[edit]\nAmanpour is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a member of the board of directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists,[43] the Center for Public Integrity,[44] the International Women's Media Foundation,[45] and the Institute for War and Peace Reporting.[46] Since April 2015 she has served as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Freedom of Expression and journalist safety.[47]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nThe Church of Saint Stephen the Martyr (1427), where Amanpour and James Rubin had their Catholic wedding in 1998. Bracciano, Italy.\nOn 9 August 1998, Amanpour was married at the Roman Catholic parish of Saint Stephen in Bracciano, Italy. The wedding was officiated by the Catholic priest, Father Ambrose O\u2019Farrell of the Dominican Order. \nFrom 1998 to 2018, Amanpour was married to American national James Rubin, a former US Assistant Secretary of State and spokesman for the US State Department during the Clinton administration and an informal adviser to former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and to former President Barack Obama. \nShe became pregnant at the age of forty\u2013one, and their only son, John Darius Rubin, was born in Columbia Hospital for Women on 27 March 2000. Having lived in London since 2000, they moved to New York City in 2010, where they rented an apartment in Manhattan's Upper West Side.[48] In May 2013, Rubin announced that the family would return to London to work on several projects,[49] and in October of the same year, Amanpour stated that she and her husband would be relocating to London permanently:\n\n \"Right now I would have to say that London is my home... My family are in England, and my husband and I are loving re\u2013acquainting ourselves with all the friends we left behind\".[50]\nIn July 2018, Amanpour and Rubin announced they were divorcing.[51]\nAmanpour is a relative by marriage of Commander\u2013General Nader Jahanbani of the Imperial Iranian Air Force of nearly twenty years until he was executed by the Islamic Revolutionaries in 1979, and of his younger brother Khosrow Jahanbani who was married to Princess Shahnaz Pahlavi. Amanpour's uncle, Captain Nasrallah Amanpour, was married to the younger sister of Khosrow and Nader.[52]\nIn June 2021, Amanpour announced that she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, had \"major successful surgery to remove it\", and would undergo several months of chemotherapy.[53]\n\nMedia appearances[edit]\nAmanpour appeared in the television series Gilmore Girls as herself in the finale, \"Bon Voyage\" (2007). Throughout the series, Amanpour was an inspiration to one of the main characters, an aspiring journalist Rory Gilmore. In July 2009 she appeared in a Harper's Bazaar magazine article entitled \"Christiane Amanpour Gets a High-Fashion Makeover\".[54]\nAmanpour played herself in newscasts in the films Iron Man 2 and Pink Panther 2. In Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, she voiced Enheduanna in the episode \"The Immortals\".\nIn 2014, Amanpour narrated \"Women in War\", an episode of season 2 of Makers: Women Who Make America.[55]\nIn 2016 Amanpour was a castaway on the BBC radio program Desert Island Discs. As her luxury item, she chose a guitar previously owned by Bruce Springsteen.[56]\n\nList of Recognitions[edit]\n\n1993: Livingston Award for Young Journalists\n1993: George Polk Award for Television Reporting\n1993: George Foster Peabody Personal Award[18]\n1994: Woman of the Year, New York Chapter of \"Women in Cable\"\n1994: Courage in Journalism Award, International Women's Media Foundation[57]\n1995: Honorary Doctor of Laws degree, University of Rhode Island\n1996: George Polk Award for Television Reporting\n1997: Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree, Emory University\n1997: Nymphe d'Honneur at the Monte Carlo Television Festival\n1998: George Foster Peabody Personal Award for International Reporting[17]\n2000: Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[58]\n2002: Edward R.

He was known for writing Afrikaans novels, novellas, columns, youth novels, short stories, plays, radio dramas, film scripts and television dramas.  Biography Barnard was born in Mataffin in the Nelspruit district of South Africa on 15 July 1939, and matriculated at Ho\u00ebrskool Nelspruit [af] in 1957. He majored in Afrikaans-Nederlands and History of Art at the University of Pretoria.  In the 1960s he and several other authors were notable figures in the Afrikaans literary movement known as Die Sestigers ( \"The Sixty-ers \"). These writers sought to use Afrikaans as a language to speak against the apartheid government, and also to bring into Afrikaans literature the influence of contemporary English and French trends.  During 1962 Barnard married his first wife, Anette, and together they produced three sons Johan, Stephan and Tian. After divorcing his first wife in 1978, he married his second wife, Katinka Heyns.[1] His fourth son, Simon, is born out of this marriage.  Barnards second novel, Mahala,[2] is considered an Afrikaans classic. He died on 28 December 2015 of a heart attack.[3]  Works Prose Bekende onrus novel (1961) Die houtbeeld novella (1961) Boela van die blouwater youth novel (1962) Man in die middel novel (1963) Dwaal novella (1964) Die swanesang van majoor Sommer novella (1965) Duiwel-in-die-bos short stories (1968) Mahala novel (1971) Chriskras short stories and sketches (1972) Danda youth novel (1974) Chriskras: n tweede keur short stories and sketches (1976) Danda op Oudeur youth novel (1977) So onder deur die maan: Chriskras 3 short stories and sketches (1985) Voetpad na Vergelegen youth novel (1987) Klopdisselboom \u2013 die beste van Chriskras short stories and sketches (1988) Moerland novel (1992) Boendoe novel (1999) Oulap se blou[4] short stories (2008) Plays and radio dramas Pa, maak vir my n vlie\u00ebr, Pa (1964) n Stasie in die niet (1970) Die rebellie van Lafras Verwey (1971) Iemand om voor nag te s\u00ea (1975) Op die pad na Acapulco (1975) n Man met vakansie (1977) Taraboemdery (1977)",

A member of the Democratic Party, he has led the Senate Democratic Caucus since 2017 and was Senate Minority Leader from 2017 to 2021. Schumer is in his fifth Senate term, making him the longest-serving US senator from New York, having surpassed Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jacob K. Javits in 2023. He is the dean of New York's congressional delegation.\nA native of Brooklyn and a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Schumer was a three-term member of the New York State Assembly from 1975 to 1980. He served nine terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1999, first representing New York's 16th congressional district before being redistricted to the 10th congressional district in 1983 and 9th congressional district 10 years later. In 1998, Schumer was elected to the Senate, defeating three-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato. He was reelected in 2004 with 71% of the vote, in 2010 with 66% of the vote, in 2016 with 70% of the vote, and in 2022 with 56% of the vote.\nSchumer chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2005 to 2009, overseeing 14 Democratic gains in the Senate in the 2006 and 2008 elections. He was the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, behind Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Majority Whip Dick Durbin. He served as Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus in the Senate from 2007 to 2017[4] and chaired the Senate Democratic Policy Committee from 2011 to 2017.[5] Schumer won his fourth term in the Senate in 2016 and was then unanimously elected Democratic leader to succeed Reid, who was retiring.[6][7]\nIn January 2021, Schumer became Senate Majority Leader, becoming the first Jewish Senate majority leader. As majority leader, Schumer shepherded through the Senate some of the Biden administration's major legislative initiatives, such as the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and the Respect for Marriage Act. Under his leadership, the Senate confirmed the most federal judges during the first two years of any presidency since John F. Kennedy's, and the most diverse slate of federal judicial nominations in American history,[8] including Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African American woman to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\n\nEarly life and education (1950\u20131974)\nSchumer was born on November 23, 1950, in Midwood, Brooklyn, the son of Selma (n\u00e9e Rosen) and Abraham Schumer.[9] His father ran an exterminating business, and his mother was a homemaker.[10][11] He and his family are Jewish,[12] and he is a second cousin, once removed, of comedian Amy Schumer.[13][14][15] His ancestors originated from the town of Chortkiv, Galicia, in what is now western Ukraine.[16]\nSchumer attended Brooklyn public schools, scoring 1600 on the SAT and graduating as the valedictorian of James Madison High School in 1967. He competed for Madison High on the television quiz show It's Academic.[17] He attended Harvard College, where he originally majored in chemistry before switching to social studies after volunteering on Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign in 1968.[18] After graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1971, Schumer attended Harvard Law School, earning his Juris Doctor with honors in 1974. He passed the New York state bar in early 1975, but never practiced law, opting rather for a career in politics.[19]\n\nEarly career (1975\u20131998)\nSchumer during the 100th Congress\nIn 1974, Schumer ran for and was elected to the New York State Assembly, filling a seat previously held by Schumer's mentor, Congressman Stephen Solarz.[20] Schumer served three terms, from 1975 to 1981, sitting in the 181st, 182nd and 183rd New York State Legislatures.[21][22][23][20]\nIn 1980, 16th district Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman won the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat of Republican Jacob Javits. Schumer ran for Holtzman's vacated House seat and won.[20] He was reelected eight times from the Brooklyn and Queens-based district, which changed numbers twice in his tenure (it was numbered the 16th from 1981 to 1983, the 10th from 1983 to 1993, and the 9th from 1993). In 1982, as a result of redistricting, Schumer faced a potential matchup with Solarz, but the matchup did not materialize.[20][24] In preparation, Schumer \"set about making friends on Wall Street, tapping the city's top law firms and securities houses for campaign donations. 'I told them I looked like I had a very difficult reapportionment fight. If I were to stand a chance of being re-elected, I needed some help,' he would later tell the Associated Press.\"[24]\nSchumer introduced The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (also known as RFRA) on March 11, 1993.[25]\nAs a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Schumer was one of four members of Congress who oversaw the House investigation (leading the Democratic defense of the Clinton administration),[26] of the Waco siege hearings in 1995.[27]\n\nU.S. Senate (1999\u2013present)\nSchumer during the 107th Congress\nIn 1998, Schumer ran for the Senate. He won the Democratic primary with 51% of the vote against Geraldine Ferraro (21%) and Mark Green (19%). He received 54% of the vote in the general election,[28] defeating three-term incumbent Republican Al D'Amato (44%).\nIn 2004, Schumer was reelected with 71% of the vote, defeating the Republican nominee, Assemblyman Howard Mills of Middletown, and conservative Marilyn F. O'Grady. Many New York Republicans were dismayed by the selection of Mills over the conservative Michael Benjamin, who held significant advantages over Mills in both fundraising and organization.[29] Benjamin publicly accused GOP chairman Sandy Treadwell and governor George Pataki of trying to muscle him out of the Senate race and undermine the democratic process.[29] Schumer defeated Mills by 2.8 million votes.[30] He won every county in the state except Hamilton County, in the Adirondacks, the least populous and most Republican county.[30] Mills conceded defeat minutes after the polls closed, before returns had come in.[30]\nAn April 2009 SurveyUSA poll placed Schumer's approval rating at 62%, with 31% disapproving.[31]\nNotable former aides to Schumer include former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, former New York State Senator Daniel Squadron, and New York State Assemblymembers Phil Goldfeder and Victor M. Pichardo.[32][33]\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, Schumer said the Democratic Party lost due to not having \"a strong, bold economic message\" and called on Democrats to push for reforms in the affordability of college and trade laws.[34]\n\nSchumer with his fellow congressional leaders in January 2020\nSenate Democratic leader\nSchumer attending the inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the United States, January 20, 2017\nSchumer is among the members of the Senate leadership meeting with Donald Trump and Mike Pence in the Oval Office, January 24, 2017.\nThe Senate Democratic caucus elected Schumer minority leader in November 2016. Schumer had been widely expected to lead Senate Democrats after Reid announced his retirement in 2015. He is the first New Yorker, as well as the first Jewish person, to serve as a Senate leader.[35] On January 20, 2021, Democrats gained control of the Senate with the swearing-in of newly elected Georgia senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, following the 2020\u201321 election runoff and special election runoff, making Schumer the majority leader, replacing Republican Mitch McConnell.[36]\n\nPolitical style\nSchumer and Hillary Clinton at Erie Canal Harbor opening ceremony\nSchumer and President Barack Obama in October 2013\nSchumer's propensity for publicity is the subject of a running joke among many commentators. He has been called an \"incorrigible publicity hound\".[37] Bob Dole once quipped, \"the most dangerous place in Washington is between Charles Schumer and a television camera\";[38] Barack Obama joked that Schumer brought the press to a banquet as his \"loved ones\".[39][40][41][42] Schumer often schedules media appearances on Sundays. Some have cited his use of media as a successful way to raise a politician's profile nationally and among his constituents.[43] Schumer has appeared on The Daily Show seven times.[44]\nIn Washington, Schumer has been a lead consensus-builder on the difficult issues of health care, immigration, and financial regulation.[45]\nAs chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies for the Second Inauguration of Barack Obama, Schumer played a key role in organizing the event, gave the opening speech and served as master of ceremonies.[46] A photograph of a smiling Schumer peering from behind Malia Obama as Obama took the oath of office went viral and became a meme.[47] Although it was called a \"photobomb\",[48] it was not technically one as he was standing in the correct place.[49][47] The Huffington Post quipped, \"clearly, inauguration day belonged to Chuck Schumer.\"[50]\n\nLocal issues\nSchumer at the Binghamton St. Patrick's Day Parade on March 5, 2016\nSchumer attended an anti-Trump march in New York City on January 21, 2017.\nSchumer prides himself on visiting each of New York's 62 counties every year and has done so in each of the years he has served in the Senate, the only New York senator to have done so.[51] He has a reputation for focusing on local issues important to average New Yorkers not normally associated with United States senators, ranging from tourism to local taxes to job creation.[52][53][54][55] When it was revealed that Adidas planned to end its contract for the manufacture of NBA jerseys with American Classic Outfitters, an upstate New York apparel company, and outsource production overseas, Schumer blasted the company, citing the risk to 100 workers at the plant.[56]\nWhen it was revealed that Canon Inc. was considering relocating from its corporate headquarters in Long Island because of a dispute over road infrastructure funding, Schumer stepped in to advocate that New York state redirect federal stimulus dollars to make the road improvements and keep the company and its jobs on Long Island.[57] Along with his House and Senate colleagues, Schumer successfully worked to kill a Bush-era privatization plan for custodial and utility workers at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The plan would have called for turning over custodial and utility work to a Georgia company.[58]\nIn November 2017, Schumer and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced $1,908,486 in funding for Head Start and Early Head Start programs at the Community Action Organization of Erie County, Schumer saying the federal funding would yield \"real results to young students in Western New York by providing them with the resources they need to succeed both in and out of the classroom\".[59]\nIn January 2018, Schumer requested that the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs complete final acquisitions for two 60-acre and 77-acre parcels in Pembroke, New York, and initiate construction of the New Western New York National Veterans Cemetery, saying the completion of the cemetery would ensure \"Western New York's military veterans will have the proper burial, at a site close to the homes, families, and the very communities they dedicated their lives to defend and serve.\"[60]\n\nDrugs\nIn May 2001, Schumer and Senator John McCain introduced legislation intended to make it more difficult for makers of brand-name drugs to keep cheaper generic drugs off the market.[61] A coalition of consumer groups supported the legislation and Schumer told reporters its enactment would reduce prescription drug costs by over 60% per prescription in addition to saving consumers $71\u00a0billion over the next decade.[62]\nIn October 2001, during a press conference, Schumer stated his desire that generic ciprofloxacin be available for government use. At that time, Bayer held exclusive patent rights for its commercial product, Cipro. Schumer also said he believed the federal government had the authority to order the immediate production of generic ciproflaxin to expand the government stockpile of the drug.[63]\nIn July 2002, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Schumer and McCain that could lower the costs of generic drugs more rapidly available to U.S. consumers and thereby lead to savings of billions of dollars in drug costs.[64] The legislation also attempted to prevent frivolous lawsuits by brand-name drug manufacturers claiming generic drugs infringed their patents.[65] An identical bill was introduced in the House but did not pass.[66]\n\nFBI\nIn November 2001, Schumer joined fellow New York Senator Hillary Clinton to call for legislation encouraging the Federal Bureau of Investigation to share information on terrorism with local and state police by removing legal barriers to such cooperation, citing reports by New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani that federal authorities did not tell city police what they were aware of. Schumer joined Patrick Leahy to report that the Justice Department supported the legislation.[67]\nIn October 2016, after FBI director James Comey announced the reopening of an investigation into whether Hillary Clinton, then the Democratic presidential nominee, mishandled classified emails during her tenure at the State Department, Schumer said he had lost confidence in Comey.[68] In May 2017, after President Donald Trump fired Comey, Schumer told reporters they were aware the FBI had been investigating whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia and pondered whether the investigation was \"getting too close to home for the president\".[69] In a Senate floor speech, Schumer called for a \"impartial and independent\" investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, announcing the Democrats had agreed that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would not be able to appoint a special prosecutor for an investigation into Russia's meddling; that Comey meet with the Senate; and that Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions meet separately with senators.[70]\nIn January 2018, Schumer said that since Mueller's investigation began, the United States \"has had to endure conspiracy after conspiracy from the right wing, Republican congressmen, senators and of course the right-wing press, which acts in total cahoots\" in regard to their views on the FBI, and that the Republicans' effort to discredit Mueller \"has now devolved into delusional, self-serving paranoia\".[71] In May, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a briefing by Department of Justice officials on an FBI informant who made contact with the Trump campaign,[72] Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI director Christopher A. Wray calling for \"a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers\".[73]\n\nSupreme Court\nSchumer meeting with Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson\nIn September 2005, after President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts for Chief Justice of the United States, Schumer praised Roberts's brilliance, his being \"a lawyer above all\", and his \"judicial philosophy and modesty and stability\" during the Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearings for Roberts. But Schumer said Roberts's \"compassion and humanity\" was questionable, and objected to the Bush administration's refusal to show documents Roberts wrote during his tenure as deputy solicitor general and to Roberts's refusal to answer many questions the committee asked him.[74] In June 2018, Schumer said Roberts was demeaning the Supreme Court as it became more political, citing the court ruling in favor of anti-abortion clinics in California. Schumer said the court had \"affirmed a plainly discriminatory travel ban, unleashed a flood of dark unlimited money in our politics and has scrapped a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act\" and thereby aligned itself with goals of what he called \"the hard right\".[75]\nIn October 2005, Schumer said Bush Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers \"would not get a majority either in the Judiciary Committee or the floor\" and that her confirmation hearings would cause her to gather either support or opposition in a way that had not been seen by any other nominee in recent memory.[76]\nIn May 2009, he told reporters the confirmation process for Obama Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor would be \"more of a test of the Republican Party than it is of Judge Sotomayor\", calling Sotomayor a \"mainstream justice\" whom Republicans had no reason to oppose.[77]\nIn March 2016, after Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace the deceased Antonin Scalia, Schumer called for Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley to hold hearings \"so America can make its own judgment as to whether Merrick Garland belongs on the court\".[78] In July 2018, it was reported Schumer had advocated that Trump nominate Garland as a way to attract bipartisan support, as opposed to nominating someone opposed to the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade who would be more controversial.[79] In November 2016, Schumer said the Democrats would \"go at\" President-elect Trump if he did not nominate Supreme Court justices who were mainstream and the Republicans did not have \"clean hands\" for having blocked the Garland nomination for months.[80]\nIn March 2017, at the end of Senate hearings for Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, Schumer said he would vote against confirmation and called on Democrats to join him in blocking an up-or-down vote on Gorsuch. In his floor speech, Schumer said, \"If this nominee cannot earn 60 votes\u2014a bar met by each of President Obama's nominees and George Bush's last two nominees\u2014the answer isn't to change the rules. It's to change the nominee.\"[81] The Democrats conducted the filibuster, but Republicans broke it using the \"nuclear option\", and Gorsuch was confirmed the next day.[82]\nIn July 2018, after Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Anthony Kennedy, Schumer said Kavanaugh should be asked direct questions about the precedent set by Roe v. Wade and other cases. Schumer noted Kavanaugh's expressed opinion on the possible incorrect decision in United States v. Nixon and that this could mean he would not hold Trump accountable as a justice.[83]\nOn August 21, Schumer said he was requesting that documents from Kavanaugh's White House tenure be shared with the Senate, arguing that \"withholding documents from the Senate and the American people under the bogus label of committee confidential is a dark development for the Senate.\"[84] After meeting with Kavanaugh, Schumer said he had asked him whether he believed Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood were properly decided and that Kavanaugh had not responded and the lack of an answer \"should send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom for women\". He also said Kavanaugh had a special obligation to make his views clear due to his unique position as the only person nominated to the Supreme Court by a president who said, \"I will only nominate someone who overturns Roe v Wade.\"[85] Schumer subsequently called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to delay Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing after former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen plead guilty to charges of bank fraud, tax fraud and campaign finance law violations, calling the plea \"a game changer\".[86]\n\n2020 comments about Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch\nIn March 2020, Schumer came under controversy for statements he made about Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both of whom were nominated by Trump. At a rally outside the United States Capitol while the Supreme Court was hearing an abortion-related case, Schumer said that if Kavanaugh and Gorsuch voted against abortion rights, they would have \"unleashed a whirlwind\" and would \"pay the price\". He then said, \"You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\" Republicans and Democrats, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, condemned these comments as inciting violence. Senator Josh Hawley called for a censure.[87] A spokesman for Schumer said the comments were in reference to the political price Senate Republicans would pay, and criticized Roberts for following a \"right-wing\" attack to misinterpret the comments.[88] Schumer later apologized for the comments.[89]\n\nNet neutrality\nIn November 2017, Schumer said, \"Just as our free highway system helped build jobs in America in the 20th century, net neutrality will help build jobs in the 21st century. To take a step back hurts our economy, our job growth and middle-class and working people. It is a disaster.\"[90] In December, after the FCC voted to repeal net neutrality rules, Schumer said the internet could start resembling \"a toll road, with the highest bidders cruising along private 'fast lanes' while the rest of us inch along a single, traffic-choked public lane; and we could be forced to purchase internet packages much like cable packages, paying more for popular sites\", and that the resolution he was introducing would undo the effects of the vote.[91]\nIn January 2018, Schumer announced all 49 members of the Democratic caucus supported a resolution overturning the FCC vote on net neutrality and said congressional Republicans \"have the opportunity to right the administration's wrong and show the American people whose side they're on: big ISPs' and major corporations' or consumers', entrepreneurs', and small business owners'.\"[92] In May, the Senate adopted a measure to revive Obama-era internet regulations enforcing equal treatment for all web traffic. Schumer called the vote \"our best chance to make sure the internet stays accessible and affordable to all Americans\".[93] In June, in response to the Republican-controlled House not taking up the Senate resolution restoring net neutrality rules, Schumer said, \"House Republican leaders gave a green light to the big ISPs to charge middle-class Americans, small business owners, schools, rural Americans, and communities of color more to use the internet.\"[94]\n\nCommittee assignments\nSchumer's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:[95]\n\nCommittee on Rules and Administration\nSelect Committee on Intelligence (ex officio)\nCaucus memberships\nAfterschool Caucuses[96]\nCongressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus[97]\nPolitical positions\nAbortion\nSchumer is pro-choice, and has a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America.[98]\nIn 2002, Schumer authored a provision to an industry-sponsored bill intended to make it harder for people to erase their debts by filing for bankruptcy. Anti-abortion activists opposed the measure, claiming it restricted their ability to use bankruptcy courts to write off court fines. After the bill appeared to die in May, J. Dennis Hastert spokesman John Feehery opined, \"Schumer really was pretty obnoxious about how this provision was going to hurt people who were pro-life and that really got some of our folks ginned up.\" In response, Schumer said the provision was a compromise with Henry Hyde and other colleagues and it was opposed by people who did not properly read the law.[99]\nAfter Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy retired in 2018, Schumer voiced concern about Trump's choice of replacement, believing they would try to overturn Roe v. Wade.[100]\n\nAgriculture\nIn March 2019, Schumer was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers \"have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices\" and urging his department to \"strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program\".[101]\n\nBicycle safety\nSchumer is noted for his love of cycling in New York City, especially around his home in Brooklyn.[102] In 2011, he was reported to have joined a group of neighbors on his street in Park Slope, near Prospect Park. They attempted to remove a new \"protected\" bicycle path on their street,[103] which ran adjacent to the curb, with a protection buffer provided by parallel-parked cars next to the bike lane.[104] While Schumer has not taken a public position on the traffic-calming project, whose most prominent feature is a two-way protected bike path, his wife, Iris Weinshall, is a prominent opponent of the project, and the New York Post reported that Schumer has lobbied against the bike path behind the scenes.[105] In addition, a major Schumer campaign contributor[106] has fought a controversial pro bono legal battle against the project, drawing criticism.[107]\n\nBush administration judicial nominations\nIn January 2004, after President Bush renominated Charles Pickering to the federal appeals court along with 30 other nominees who had failed to win confirmation under the previous Democratic-controlled Senate, Schumer stated his intent to prevent Pickering's confirmation and said the US could do better.[108]\nIn 2007, after Bush nominated former federal judge Michael Mukasey to become attorney general of the United States (replacing Gonzales, who had resigned), Schumer expressed support for Mukasey. Despite appearing troubled by Mukasey's refusal to declare in public that waterboarding was illegal torture, Schumer announced on November 2 that he would vote to confirm Mukasey.[109] He said Mukasey had assured him in a private meeting that he would enforce any law declaring waterboarding illegal, and that Mukasey had told him Bush would have \"no legal authority\" to ignore such a law.[110]\n\nCannabis\nSchumer speaking at the NYC Cannabis Parade & Rally in 2022\nIn April 2018, Schumer said that he would back efforts to decriminalize cannabis at the federal level.[111] On April 20, a day known as 4/20, he announced his sponsorship of legislation to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would also provide funding for women and minority-owned businesses and for research into the public health effects of cannabis.[112] On June 27, 2018, Schumer formally introduced the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act.[113]\nOn July 14, 2021, Schumer, along with Senators Ron Wyden and Cory Booker, released for public comment a comprehensive federal legalization bill known as the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act.[114][115] On July 21, 2022, he formally introduced the bill.[116]\n\nClinton impeachment\nSchumer voted on the impeachment charges of President Bill Clinton in both houses of Congress. Schumer was a member of the House of Representatives (and Judiciary Committee member) during a December 1998 lame-duck session of Congress, voting \"no\" on all counts in committee and on the floor of the House. In January 1999, Schumer, as a newly elected member of the Senate, also voted \"not guilty\" on the two impeachment charges.[117]\n\nConsumer issues\nSchumer has given legislative attention to consumer issues. He passed legislation that required uniform disclosure information on the back of credit card applications, notifying prospective cardholders of annual fees and interest rates. This standardized information is now known as the \"Schumer box\". Schumer has also aggressively pushed to end the practice whereby customers can be charged two ATM fees, one by their own bank and one by the bank that owns the ATM, if the ATM is outside their bank's network.[118]\nWith Representative Nita Lowey, Schumer has been working to ban the chemical bisphenol A (BPA), often found in baby bottles and plastic children's food containers.[119] The Canadian government has already banned BPA in baby bottles and children's products.[120] Schumer is also seeking a ban on the use of cadmium, a carcinogen known to impair brain development in children, in toys and children's jewelry.[121] When companies began selling gloves, pills, inhalers, diuretics, shampoos and other products during the 2009 swine flu scare, Schumer urged the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to open an investigation. In the end, the FTC put ten companies on notice and identified a total of 140 scams.[122]\nSchumer has championed college tuition tax credits, calling for and passing a $4,000 tuition tax credit for students as part of a host of tax credits and cuts passed to stimulate the economy in the 2009 American Reinvestment and Recovery Act.[123]\nSchumer received an \"A\" grade on the 2008 Drum Major Institute's Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.[124]\nIn October 2013, Schumer announced his support for a proposal ending restrictions on shipping beer, wine, and spirits through the U.S. Postal Service, saying it would \"help keep local post offices open by bringing in an estimated $225\u00a0million in new revenues to the USPS\" and broaden the availability of beers and wines to consumers.[125]\n\nDeath penalty\nIn 2013, Schumer said the death penalty would be \"appropriate\" in the case of the Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombing. \"The federal law allows the death penalty.\u00a0... I wrote the law in 1994 when I was head of the crime subcommittee in the House. This is just the kind of case that it should be applied to.\"[126][127]\n\nDisaster relief\nIn 2014, Schumer was recognized for helping to achieve the award of $700,000 in compensation from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for Gowanda, New York, as a result of the devastating flood there in 2009.[128][129] A flash flood devastated the village, causing two deaths. Four feet of flood waters swept through the village, and caused much damage.[128][129] Gowanda was declared both a state and federal disaster site.[128][129]\nOf the anticipated disbursement of FEMA monies to Gowanda, Schumer said:\n\nFEMA and the state were sitting on Gowanda's money for way too long. It's about time that they made the village of Gowanda whole for the damage done in this flood. I've been advocating for this for months and months and months; I'm glad everyone came together and finally did the right thing.[128][129] \nDonald Trump\nSchumer attended the congressional leadership meeting with Trump in the White House Situation Room on January 2, 2019.\nIn a November 2016 interview conducted in the weeks after Trump's election to the presidency, Schumer said that he and Trump were not friends and had had \"civil conversations a couple of times\" when Trump had contacted him. Trump had said earlier that year that he believed he would get along with Schumer and that he was \"close to Schumer in many ways\".[130] In December 2016, Schumer called on Trump cabinet nominees to release their tax returns and in doing so follow the precedent set by Steve Mnuchin and Tom Price.[131]\nIn February 2017, before Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress, Schumer predicted that the speech would be less memorable than ones delivered by Trump's predecessors due to what he called \"a yawning gap between what he says and what his administration actually does for working Americans\". Though acknowledging Trump's populist campaigning style, Schumer said Trump \"governs like a pro-corporate, pro-elite, hard-right ideologue\".[132]\nIn March 2017, Schumer released a statement calling on Trump to apologize for claiming the Obama administration had wiretapped him during his presidential campaign. He advocated that Trump stop tweeting to better focus on working on behalf of the United States and said Trump had \"severely damaged his credibility\" by promoting conspiracy theories.[133]\nIn June 2018, Schumer delivered a Senate floor speech decrying Representative Maxine Waters's call to harass members of the Trump administration as protest of the administration's policies: \"I strongly disagree with those who advocate harassing folks if they don't agree with you. If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action and vote them out of office. But no one should call for the harassment of political opponents. That's not right. That's not American.\"[134]\nIn August 2018, in response to Trump's charge that American Jews who vote for Democrats are \"disloyal\", Schumer tweeted, \"When he [Trump] uses a trope that's been used against the Jewish people for centuries with dire consequences, he is encouraging\u2014wittingly or unwittingly\u2014anti-Semites throughout the country and world.\"[135]\nSchumer was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count on January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. Schumer and other members of Congress were removed from the Senate chambers. He and Mitch McConnell joined Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer in an undisclosed location. As the attack persisted, Schumer and Pelosi released a joint statement calling on Trump to demand the rioters leave the Capitol and its grounds immediately.[136] When the Senate reconvened after the Capitol was secure, Schumer gave remarks, calling it a day \"that will live forever in infamy\".[137] Later that day, he blamed Trump for the attack, calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to remove Trump from office. He also said he would support impeachment.[138]\n\nElection reform\nIn March 2002, as the Senate worked on a compromise to save an election reform bill that stalled due to Republicans' believing it was not combative enough against voter fraud, Schumer and Senator Ron Wyden led a successful effort in protecting an amendment allowing first-time voters to be verified with only a signature.[139]\n\nEqual pay\nIn April 2014, the United States Senate debated the Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 2199; 113th Congress), a bill aimed at addressing the gender pay gap in the United States.[140] Republicans argued that the Democrats were attempting to use the votes on this bill and the issue of equal pay as political issues in the 2014 midterm elections.[140] Schumer backed the measure and told reporters, \"pay equity, that's women, that's 53 percent of the vote\".[140]\n\nFinancial industry regulation\nIn 1987, then-Representative Schumer wrote a New York Times op-ed opposing repeal of the Glass\u2013Steagall Act of 1933, titled \"Don't Let Banks Become Casinos\".[141] In 1999, Schumer supported Congress's repeal of Glass\u2013Steagall, saying: \"There are many reasons for this bill, but first and foremost is to ensure that U.S. financial firms remain competitive.\"[142] Since 2010, the securities and investment industry has been the largest donor to Schumer's senatorial campaigns.[143]\nAccording to a December 14, 2008, New York Times article on Schumer's role in the Wall Street meltdown, he embraced the industry's free-market, deregulatory agenda more than any other Democrat in Congress, backing measures blamed for contributing to the financial crisis. A review of his record showed that he took steps to protect the industry from government oversight and tougher rules. Over the years, he helped save financial institutions billions of dollars in taxes or fees. The article claimed that Schumer succeeded in limiting efforts to reform and regulate credit-rating agencies the George W. Bush administration and the SEC had proposed.[144]\nThe Charles Schumer-Rob Portman Senate bill of 2015[145] proposed to tax the $2.2\u00a0trillion multinational corporations are holding outside the country in tax-haven subsidiaries, on which 35% was already owed, as a one-time tax \"at a rate significantly lower than the statutory corporate rate\".[146]\nIn his book released in March 2010, No One Would Listen, Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos passed along an unsourced claim that Schumer called the SEC for information about the Madoff investigation. Schumer denied this.[147]\nIn response to The American Prospect's Day One Agenda,[148] Schumer announced a new stance on eliminating student debt. In November 2020, he said, \"I have a proposal with Elizabeth Warren that the first $50,000 of debt be vanquished, and we believe that Joe Biden can do that with the pen as opposed to legislation\".[149]\n\nForeign policy\nIn 2009, Schumer criticized Scotland's release of convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and called for the United States to impose economic sanctions on the United Kingdom if Megrahi's release was tied to a massive oil deal between the United Kingdom and Libya.[150]\nIn April 2017, after the Shayrat missile strike, Schumer said a \"pinpointed, limited action to punish and hopefully deter Assad from doing this again is appropriate\" while warning against the United States becoming further involved in Syria.[151]\nIn July 2017, Schumer voted for the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia, and North Korea.[152]\nIn July 2018, after Trump criticized Germany's decision to approve a new Russian-German gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea bypassing Poland and Ukraine, Schumer and House Minority Leader Pelosi released a joint statement condemning Trump's comments as an embarrassment and his behavior as \"another profoundly disturbing signal that the President is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies\".[153]\n\nIn October 2020, Schumer called on the Trump administration to immediately suspend U.S. military aid to Azerbaijan,[154][155] sent through the Pentagon's \"building partner assistance program\".[155][156] According to critics, the aid could be used in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.[155][157] He co-signed a letter stating: We have been very critical of U.S. security assistance to Azerbaijan given the country's human rights record and aggression in the region. Earlier this year, at Senator Menendez's request, the Government Accountability Office agreed to conduct a review of security assistance to the country to ensure that it aligns with U.S. interests; this violence indicates that it does not.[155]\nAfghanistan\nIn March 2006, the House Appropriations Committee voted to block an amendment allowing Dubai Ports World to operate some terminals at U.S. ports, an amendment that was inserted into the emergency supplemental funding bill for military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The same day, Schumer introduced an amendment barring a company from operating in a U.S. port if the company was owned by a country that recognized the Taliban's regime in Afghanistan, the amendment being touted as similar to the House measure. Senate majority leader Bill Frist subsequently asked for a quorum call that effectively gnarled proceedings, Schumer afterward opining that the Democrats had \"bent over backwards to try and accommodate the Republican schedule\" and that Frist's move meant Republicans did not want a vote at all.[158]\nIn October 2009, Schumer said, \"It cost us $6 trillion and 4,500 lives, approximately, to bring stability to Iraq. Just in terms of the loss of life and treasure, do we want to do the same exercise in Afghanistan?\" He said the United States could potentially be able to keep itself safe without bringing stability to Afghanistan and advocated that American forces be scaled back in Afghanistan in favor of more reliance on unmanned drone attacks.[159]\nIn April 2017, Schumer called for caution in Afghanistan, noting the casualties in Iraq, and said the military would have to come to Congress if it wanted more American soldiers in Afghanistan.[160]\n\nChina\nIn 2006, NPR reported that Schumer and Senator Lindsey Graham were highly critical of the trade imbalance between the U.S. and China, and its alleged cause of Chinese currency intervention.[161]\nIn 2017, Schumer wrote to Trump advocating for a block on China that would prevent it from purchasing more American companies to increase pressure on Beijing to help rein in North Korea's nuclear missile program.[162] In May 2018, after Trump signaled his willingness to ease sanctions on ZTE in a bid for a trade deal with Beijing, Schumer observed, \"This seems to be an area where Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate are coming together and telling the president, you've got to be tough on China, you have to have your actions match your rhetoric.\"[163]\nBefore the Trump administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Schumer and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China. Schumer said, \"China has stolen millions of jobs and trillions of dollars [but] administrations from both parties haven't been strong enough to fight back.\"[164][165][166]\n\nIran nuclear deal\nOn August 6, 2015, Schumer announced his opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran.[167] He planned to tell the White House, then his Senate colleagues, and then the public, but the White House leaked the news during the Republican debate in what CBS News described as an \"apparent attempt to limit coverage\".[168] Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis derided Schumer's decision, noting that Schumer was making factually incorrect claims about the amount of time in which the treaty would allow inspection of Iranian nuclear facilities.[169] In what The Guardian described as a \"shot across Schumer's bow\", White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that fellow Democrats might remember Schumer's decision when deciding whom to elect as their next majority leader.[170]\n\nIraq\nSchumer was a supporter of the Iraq War Resolution but was very critical of President George W. Bush's strategy in the Iraq War; he suggested that a commission of ex-generals be appointed to review it.[171]\nIn April 2002, during a Senate speech, Schumer called the Bush administration's Middle East policy \"muddled, confused and inconsistent\" and said the planned meeting between Secretary of State Colin Powell and Yasser Arafat would contradict Bush's stated stand against terrorists and those harboring them.[172] Nat Hentoff of the Village Voice wrote in November 2006 that \"the loquacious Schumer has been indifferent to the administration's war on the Constitution and on our laws and treaties\", particularly on the issue of torture.[173]\nIn July 2006, Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki stated that Iraq was urging the international community \"to take a quick and firm stance to stop this aggression against Lebanon, to stop the killing of innocent people and to stop the destruction of infrastructure\". In response, Schumer, Harry Reid, and Dick Durbin signed a letter to al-Maliki in which they charged him with failing to condemn the aggression of Hezbollah as well as Israel's right to defend itself, arguing the oversight raised serious concern about whether Iraq under his rule could \"play a constructive role in resolving the current crisis and bringing stability to the Middle East\".[174]\nSchumer was the first senator to call for U.S. support for Kurdish independence after the 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum, releasing a resolution calling for the U.S. government to change its policy to \"support a political process that addresses the aspirations of the Kurds for an independent state\". He called upon Iraq to \"engage in a dialogue and peacefully determine the best way to accommodate the well-deserved and legitimate aspirations of the Iraqi Kurds\".[175]\n\nIsrael\nIn 1994, Schumer joined the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Congress in a campaign to get the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status of the Palestinian-American charity the Holy Land Foundation, which by the time it was shut down in 2001 was the country's largest Muslim charity.[176]\nIn June 2010, while speaking at an Orthodox Union event in Washington D.C., Schumer made comments about Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip that were later criticized.[177] He pointed to statistics to show that the Palestinian citizens of the West Bank were experiencing \"economic prosperity\", crediting this to their government's cooperation with the Israeli government on combating terrorists.[178] He then criticized the Palestinian citizens of the Gaza Strip for voting for the Hamas militant organization, calling on Israel to \"strangle them economically until they see that's not the way to go\", while also stating that Israel should continue providing \"humanitarian aid\" to Palestinian civilians. He argued that the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip is justified not only because it keeps weapons out of the Palestinian territory, but also because it shows Palestinians living there that \"when there's some moderation and cooperation, they can have an economic advancement.\"[177][179] Schumer added, \"The Palestinian people still don't believe in a Jewish state, in a two-state solution. More do than before, but a majority still do not ... They don't believe in the Torah. They don't believe in King David. So they don't think it's our land\".[178]\nSchumer supported Israel in the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[180] In March 2018, he told AIPAC's delegates that Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have nothing to do with the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.[181][182]\nSchumer is a co-sponsor of a Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement-building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law. He criticized Obama, saying: \"past administrations\u2014both Democrat and Republican\u2014have protected Israel from the vagaries of this biased institution [the U.N.]. Unfortunately, by abstaining on United Nations Resolution 2334, this administration has not followed in that path.\"[183]\n\nSchumer and Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv during the Israel\u2013Hamas war on October 15, 2023\nIn May 2017, Schumer co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, Senate Bill 720, which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment,[184] for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government. The bill would make it legal for U.S. states to refuse to do business with contractors that engage in boycotts against Israel.[185]\nSchumer introduced a Senate resolution celebrating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem.[186]\nIn May 2018, Schumer praised Trump for opening the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, saying, \"I sponsored legislation to do this two decades ago, and I applaud President Trump for doing it.\"[187][188] He had previously accused Trump of \"indecisiveness\" for his delays in implementing the move by waiving the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, as previous presidents had done.[189]\n\nNorth Korea\nIn February 2017, Schumer said that North Korea had proved itself to be \"an irresponsible nation in every way\" and that China could be used to curtail North Korea as most of North Korea's imports and exports go through China. He advocated that the United States tell China \"they have to put the wood to North Korea in a much more serious way than they have done so far.\"[190] In August, after Trump said North Korea would be \"met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\" in the event of continued threats against the United States, Schumer released a statement advocating that the United States be \"firm and deliberate with North Korea, but reckless rhetoric is not a strategy to keep America safe.\"[191]\n\nIn May 2018, Schumer called for Kim Jong-un to be removed from the commemorative coin memorializing the 2018 North Korea\u2013United States summit, calling Kim a \"brutal dictator\" and offering the Peace House as a more appropriate alternative.[192] In June, Schumer was one of seven senior Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump outlining the conditions of their caucus's support for any deal resulting from the North Korea-US summit.[193] After Kim and Trump issued a joint statement, Schumer said the meeting between the two had given \"a brutal and repressive dictatorship the international legitimacy it has long craved\" and that the agreement lacked details on achieving a pathway to the Korean peninsula being denuclearized, how the United States would verify North Korea's disarming, and an assurance of cessation for enrichment of plutonium and uranium from North Korea.[194] In a speech on the Senate floor, Schumer questioned what the United States had gained from the summit and added that the country had \"won far stronger language on denuclearization\" in previous agreements with North Korea. In response, Trump tweeted, Thank you Chuck, but are you sure you got that right? No more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place, blew up launch sites. Hostages already back, hero remains coming home & much more![195]\nRussia\nIn a June 3, 2008, Wall Street Journal op-ed, Schumer wrote that cooperative economic sanctions from the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China could topple Iran's theocratic government. In discussing the importance of Russia's cooperation, Schumer wrote, \"Mr. Putin is an old-fashioned nationalist who seeks to regain the power and greatness Russia had before the fall of the Soviet Union.\" He added, \"The anti-missile system strengthens the relationship between Eastern Europe and NATO, with real troops and equipment on the ground. It mocks Mr. Putin's dream of eventually restoring Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe.\"[196] On June 10, the East European Coalition sent Schumer a letter about his article, writing, \"As a supporter of democracy for the nations of Eastern Europe, which suffered greatly under 'Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe', your suggestion that these nations be used as bargaining chips in order to appease Russia is troubling, inexplicable and unacceptable.\"[197]\nIn August 2013, after Russia granted asylum to Edward Snowden, Schumer said Putin was behaving like a \"schoolyard bully\", adding, \"The relationship between the United States and Russia is more poisonous than any time since the Cold War because of all of this.\"[198]\nIn December 2016, Schumer joined John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Jack Reed in a letter to Majority Leader McConnell urging the formation of a Senate select committee on cyber. Schumer said the panel would focus on Russian meddling and potential threats from other countries such as China and Iran.[199]\nIn December 2016, Schumer demanded a congressional inquiry into Russian meddling in U.S. affairs.[200] In January 2017, in response to those questioning the U.S. intelligence community over its assessments, he said, \"Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you\".[201] Later that month, he introduced legislation to limit executive action on Russian sanctions.[202]\nIn a May 2017 Senate floor speech, Schumer called on the White House to release unedited transcripts of the meeting between Trump and Russian officials the previous week, saying the continued confidentiality would ensure \"the American people will rightly doubt if their president can handle our nation's most closely kept secrets.\"[203] In July, Schumer disavowed claims that the Democratic Party considered Russia its top priority and named health care and economic stability for working-class families as its primary concerns. \"Obviously Russia is in the news. Obviously we want Bob Mueller to be able to pursue and our committees to be able to pursue their investigations unimpeded.\"[204]\nSchumer spearheaded a non-binding resolution in July 2018 \"warning President Trump not to let the Russian government question diplomats and other officials\". The resolution stated the United States \"should refuse to make available any current or former diplomat, civil servant, political appointee, law enforcement official or member of the Armed Forces of the United States for questioning by the government of Vladimir Putin\". It passed 98\u20130.[205]\n\nGun laws\nIn 1994, then-Representative Schumer and Senator Dianne Feinstein authored the Assault Weapons Ban. Supporters of gun control legislation give Schumer much of the credit for passage of both the Assault Weapons Ban and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.[206] The Assault Weapons Ban, which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the Vitter Amendment, which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.[207]\nWhile a target of gun rights organizations, Schumer has supported hunters, sponsoring legislation to provide millions in outdoor recreation grants to landowners who allow hunting and fishing on their private property. For these efforts, Field and Stream magazine honored Schumer in its \"Hero Awards\" in 2008.[208] He supports tax deductions for hunters who donate venison and other game to feeding programs.[209] In response to a question at a debate during his 2010 reelection campaign, Schumer denied having a handgun or a permit for one. He has produced a letter from the NYPD stating that neither he nor his wife, Iris Weinshall, has a handgun license from NYC. Schumer aide Brian Fallon said, \"except for winning an NRA marksmanship award at age 14, the senator does not own a gun or have a license to carry one\".[210]\nIn February 2018, after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Schumer was one of four Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump asserting that were he \"to endorse legislation to require a background check on every gun purchase, without other poison pill provisions attached, we could finally move much closer towards the comprehensive system that you called for after the Stoneman Douglas attack\" and that there was no justification for allowing people denied firearms by federally licensed dealers to \"simply visit a gun show or go online to purchase the same gun that they were denied at the store\".[211]\nIn January 2019, Schumer was one of 40 senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, which would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill's background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, providing firearms as gifts to members of one's immediate family, firearms transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense.[212]\n\nHealth care\nIn March 2004, Schumer, Jon Corzine, Ted Kennedy, and Frank Lautenberg signed a letter to President Bush urging him to instruct staff to avoid taking action against whistleblower Richard Foster after Foster spoke out on the subject of White House efforts intended to keep Congress unaware of alternative higher cost estimates for the new Medicare prescription drug program.[213]\nSchumer supported Obama's health reform legislation; he voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009[214] and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.[215]\nIn 2009, Schumer proposed that any new government-run health insurance programs follow all the standards applicable to private insurance. He did this to \"address fears that a public program would drive private insurers from the market\". Schumer said he wanted \"a level playing field for competition\".[216]\nIn May 2017, in response to an amendment by Fred Upton to the American Health Care Act, Schumer released a statement saying the amendment \"leaves Americans with pre-existing conditions as vulnerable as they were before under this bill\" and compared it to \"administering cough medicine to someone with stage 4 cancer\".[217] After the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) showed the American Health Care Act would cause millions of Americans to lose health coverage, Schumer said, \"Republicans in Washington and the president should read this report cover to cover, throw their bill in the trash can and begin working with Democrats on a real plan to lower costs for the American people.\"[218] In June, Schumer sent McConnell a letter requesting that all senators meet to discuss the American Health Care Act, citing the need for both parties to \"come together to find solutions to America's challenges\".[219] Later that month, Schumer estimated the bill had a 50% chance of passing the Senate and added that Democrats were doing everything they could to fight the measure, calling the legislation \"devastating for the middle class\".[220]\n\nHomeland security\nIn 1995, Schumer sponsored the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995 (H.R. 896) in the House of Representatives.[221]\nAs a senator, Schumer has worked to secure homeland security funds for New York State and City and provide resources to its first responders. He delivered over $20 billion to support New York's security and recovery efforts after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York City and worked to deliver $200 million in Homeland Security funds to protect New York City mass transit.[222][223][224]\nIn November 2001, Schumer announced hearings on George W. Bush's decision to try terrorists in military tribunals amid Washington concerns that Bush would skip the American legal system in handling such cases. Schumer said the hearing's two goals were to ascertain whether Bush had the power to form a tribunal apart from an attempt at interacting with Congress and whether a military tribunal was the most efficient instrument.[225]\nIn August 2004, after American officials leaked the arrest of Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan to reporters, Schumer said he was troubled by the decision to reveal Khan's identity, citing the fact that the public had learned little of Khan's role in providing the information that led Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to announce a higher terror alert level.[226]\nSchumer supported continuing to fully fund the FIRE Grant program[227] the Federal Emergency Management Agency administered. The program allows fire departments and first responders nationwide to apply for grant funding for major purchases that localities have difficulty providing, namely apparatus and emergency vehicles. When the Bush administration pushed a plan to reduce the program from $1 billion to just under $300 million, Schumer helped lead an effort with local firefighters to block the cuts.[228]\nIn March 2018, Schumer said the bipartisan legislation sponsored by Bob Casey and Pat Toomey would assist the children of deceased first respondents afford college by increasing the availability of Pell grant funding.[229]\nIn August 2018, Schumer announced that the Senate had passed $1 million in FY2019 funding for the national firefighter cancer registry as an amendment to the upcoming FY2019 Health and Human Services minibus appropriations bill. He said firefighters needed \"first-rate medical care and treatment\" for the work they did and the registry would help \"researchers track, treat, and eventually prevent firefighters being stricken by cancer\".[230]\n\nImmigration\nWhile discussing an immigration bill on the Senate floor in 2010, Schumer likened Indian tech giant Infosys Technologies to a \"chop shop\". When his statement set off a wave of outrage in India, he acknowledged his characterization was incorrect.[231][232] The remark was also called \"outrageous\" by U.S.-India Business Council head Ron Somers.[232]\nSchumer is one of the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of four Democratic and four Republican senators who wrote and sponsored a 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill. At the time, Schumer was the chairman of the Immigration, Refugees, and Border Security subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.[233] In June 2013, the immigration bill passed the Senate with a strong majority\u201468-32, with 14 Republicans joining all Democrats\u2014but the House of Representatives under Speaker John Boehner refused to take up the bill, and the legislation died.[234]\nIn April 2012, Schumer introduced SB 1070, a bill that would kill Arizona's anti-immigration law, and ones like it if the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the states. He backed his position, saying: \"States like Arizona and Alabama will no longer be able to get away with saying they are simply 'helping the federal government' to enforce the law when they are really writing their own laws and knowingly deploying untrained officers with a mission of arresting anyone and everyone who might fit the preconceived profile of an illegal immigrant.\"[235]\nIn January 2018, Schumer stated that any agreement on the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals before its March expiration would have to be included in the spending bill.[236] Schumer offered Trump congressional approval of more than $20 billion for his border wall in exchange for protecting recipients of DACA. Trump declined the offer. A week later, Schumer announced that conversations on immigration and border security were resuming between the White House and himself.[237] In a March CNN op-ed, Schumer wrote that Trump had stood in the way of progress on \"compromise proposals that both sides should be proud of\" and charged Trump and the White House with using Dreamers as \"bargaining chips to push forward their anti-immigrant agenda\". He called on Trump to change course and said Americans would be aware that he was behind the prevention of Congress from settling the matter.[238] In June, before a planned meeting between Trump and House Republicans for discussions on the compromise immigration bill, Schumer warned that House moderates would lose credibility if they succumbed to pressure and enacted \"the hard right's agenda\".[239]\n\nIndyMac Bank controversy\nOn June 26, 2008, Schumer took the extraordinary step of publicly releasing letters he had written to regulators about IndyMac Bank, the country's seventh-largest savings and loan association and ninth-largest originator of mortgage loans, which he considered a severely troubled institution. Schumer wrote that he was \"concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers and that the regulatory community may not be prepared to take measures that would help prevent the collapse of IndyMac.\" Many IndyMac depositors either panicked or, from another perspective, justifiably acted and withdrew funds in the 11 days before IndyMac failed.[240]\nA Treasury Department's Inspector General audit found that the primary causes of IndyMac's failure were associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing Alt-A loans on a large scale. When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. IndyMac's reduced liquidity was further exacerbated when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion in deposits in a \"run\" on the thrift after the public release of Schumer's letter. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac's demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated.[241]\nOffice of Thrift Supervision (OTS) director John Reich immediately blamed IndyMac's failure on the letter's release. Reich said Schumer gave the bank a \"heart attack\", saying, \"Would the institution have failed without the deposit run? We'll never know the answer to that question.\"[242] Reich and top deputies later resigned or were removed amid a Treasury Department audit and investigation revealing that Indymac had been allowed to backdate its financial reports.[243]\nSchumer conceded his actions might have caused some depositors to withdraw their money prematurely, but said, \"if OTS had done its job as regulator and not let IndyMac's poor and loose lending practices continue, we wouldn't be where we are today. Instead of pointing false fingers of blame, OTS should start doing its job to prevent future IndyMacs.\" He added, \"IndyMac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks ... It was a spinoff from the old Countrywide, and like Countrywide, it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have. Both IndyMac and Countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we're now in.\"[244][245]\nDespite IndyMac's condition before the failure, the financial media sharply criticized Schumer. CNBC financial analyst Jerry Bowyer charged that he was responsible for the \"second largest bank failure in US history\".[246] While opining that IndyMac's failure was only a matter of time, banking consultant Bert Ely called Schumer's actions \"wrong and irresponsible\".[247]\nOn October 18, 2008, The Wall Street Journal published an article suggesting that an investment company's interest in IndyMac might have prompted Schumer's letter.[248] His reported close ties to the founders of OneWest Bank have long been of interest to many action groups. On December 22, 2008, The Washington Post reported that the OTS regional director in charge had been removed from his position for allowing IndyMac to falsify its financial reporting.[249][250] The same day, conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh continued to blame Schumer and recast IndyMac's July bankruptcy as an \"October Surprise\" planned by Democrats to help win the 2008 election.[251]\n\nSame-sex marriage\nSchumer at New York City's gay pride parade in 2007\nSchumer voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996.[252] He opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment, saying in 2004 that DOMA made it obsolete.[253]\nIn March 2009, Schumer announced his support for same-sex marriage, noting that it \"was time\".[254] He previously supported civil unions. At a private dinner with gay leaders on March 22, 2009, Schumer said he not only supported same-sex marriage, he also backed a full reversal of DOMA.[255] When the New York State Senate took up a bill to legalize gay marriage in December 2009, Schumer and other statewide officials aggressively lobbied wavering senators to support the legislation.[256]\n\nStudent loan forgiveness\nSchumer supports the cancellation of $50,000 or more in federal student loan debt for every borrower by executive action.[257]\n\nSubprime mortgage and foreclosure crisis\nSee also: United States housing bubble\nIn September 2007, Schumer proposed that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) raise Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conforming loan (\"affordable\") limits from $417,000 to $625,000, thereby allowing these government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to back mortgages on homes priced up to $780,000 with a 20% down payment.[258]\nAfter the March 2007 meltdown of the subprime mortgage industry, Schumer proposed a federal government bailout of subprime borrowers to save homeowners from losing their residences and to shore up communities that were seeing neighborhoods destabilized due to foreclosures and the resulting decreases in neighboring home values.[259] As part of a package of regulatory reforms that Schumer pushed in response to the subprime foreclosure crisis, he called for the creation of mortgage industry regulators to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices and called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to move from Washington to New York so that it was in closer proximity to the industry it was charged with overseeing.[260]\nSchumer's top nine campaign contributors are all financial institutions that have contributed over $2.5 million.[261]\n\nTaxes on high incomes\nSchumer had been a staunch defender of low taxes on hedge fund and private equity managers in the mid-2000s, arguing that this was necessary to protect the industry. Then serving on both the Senate Banking and Finance Committees, Schumer was in a position to block attempts to tax their financial gains at the rate other taxpayers pay for income.[262] But in 2010, he suggested that a hedge-fund tax would be acceptable and not hurt the industry.[263]\nIn February 2012, Schumer at first said he disagreed with the Obama administration's call to raise taxes on those making more than $250,000 a year, calling for a million-dollar floor instead. According to Schumer, \"in large parts of the country, that kind of income does not get you a big home or lots of vacations or anything else that is associated with wealth.\"[264] He later stood by the assertion but also said that raising taxes on those making more than $250,000 was necessary to bring in enough revenue.[264]\n\nTechnology and the Internet\nIn June 2011, Schumer and Senator Joe Manchin sought a crackdown on Bitcoin, saying it facilitated illegal drug trade transactions. \"The transactions leave no traditional [bank transfer] money trail for investigators to follow, and leave it hard to prove a package recipient knew in advance what was in a shipment,\" which used the anonymizing network Tor.[265] One opinion website said the senators wanted \"to disrupt [the] Silk Road drug website\".[266]\nSchumer is a sponsor of S. 968, the controversial PROTECT IP Act, which would restrict access to websites judged to be infringing copyrights.[267] On January 18, 2012, the NY Tech Meetup and other cybertech organizations held a demonstration with 2,000 protesters in front of the offices of Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, who also supported the bill.[268][269] Some demonstrators complained that the bill had originated with wealthy campaign contributors who would reward legislators for passing the bill.[270]\nIn March 2012, Schumer and Senator Richard Blumenthal gained national attention after they called upon Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice to investigate practices by employers to require Facebook passwords for employee applicants and workers.[271]\n\nFacebook\nSchumer has been described[by whom?] as an ally of Facebook amid debates around regulating Facebook or probing its involvement in various controversies, including Russian interference in the 2016 election.[272] In July 2018, Schumer confronted Senator Mark Warner, and urged him not to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.[272] As of 2018, one of Schumer's daughters worked as a marketing manager at Facebook.[272]\n\nU.S. Attorney firings\nSee also: Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy\nAs chair of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Schumer took a lead role in the investigation of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy.[273] Although he was at one point criticized for being a lead investigator of the affair while also chairing the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, such criticism was not sustained after the full dimensions of the controversy became apparent.[274][275]\nOn March 11, 2007, Schumer became the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign for firing eight United States Attorneys. In an interview on CBS News's Face the Nation, Schumer said that Gonzales \"doesn't accept or doesn't understand that he is no longer just the president's lawyer\".[276] When Gonzales's chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, resigned on March 13, Schumer said during a press conference that Gonzales was \"carrying out the political wishes of the president\" and declared that Sampson would \"not be the next Scooter Libby\", meaning that he did not accept that Sampson had sole responsibility for the controversy.[277]\nLike other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee from both parties, Schumer was angered during Gonzales's testimony on April 19, 2007; Gonzales answered many times that he did not know or could not recall details about the controversy. When Schumer's turn came to ask his last round of questions, he instead repeated his call for Gonzales to resign, saying that there was no point to further questioning since Gonzales had \"answered 'I don't know' or 'I can't recall' to close to a hundred questions\" about the firings (most press reports counted 71 instances) and did not seem to know about the inner workings of his department. Gonzales responded that the onus was on the committee to prove whether anything improper occurred. Schumer replied that Gonzales faced a higher standard, and that under this standard he had to give \"a full, complete and convincing explanation\" for why the eight attorneys were fired.[278]\n\nOther work\nIn January 2007, Schumer published a book, Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time, outlining strategies by which Democrats could court middle-class voters. One of his aides at the time, Daniel Squadron, helped write it, and they drew from Schumer's experience helping his party win in the 2006 midterm elections.[32][279]\nOn November 21, 2023, Schumer made his Broadway debut in a one-night performance as the Producer in Gutenberg! The Musical!.[280]\n\nPersonal life\nSchumer and his wife, Iris Weinshall, were married on September 21, 1980. The ceremony took place at Windows on the World atop the north tower of the World Trade Center.[281] Weinshall was New York City's commissioner of transportation from 2000 to 2007.[282] Schumer and Weinshall live in Park Slope near Grand Army Plaza.[283]\nThe Schumers have two children, Jessica and Alison, both graduates of their father's alma mater, Harvard College. Jessica served as chief of staff and general counsel of the Council of Economic Advisers from May 2013 to August 2015.[284] Alison is a marketing manager in Facebook's New York office.[285] In 2018, Jessica gave birth to a son, making Schumer a grandfather.[286]\n\nElectoral history\n\n\nYear\n\nOffice\n\nType\n\nParty\n\nMain opponent\n\nParty\n\nVotes for Schumer\n\nTotal\n\nResult\n\nSwing\n\n\nTotal\n\n%\n\nP.\n\n\u00b1%\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\u00b1%\n\n\n1998\n\nSenator\n\nDem. primary\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nGeraldine Ferraro\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\n388,701\n\n50.84%\n\n1st\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nWon\n\nN/A\n\n\nInd. primary\n\n\n\nIndependence\n\nMark Green\n\n\n\nIndependence\n\n2,562\n\n58.04%\n\n1st\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nWon\n\nN/A\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nAl D'Amato (inc.)\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\n2,386,314\n\n51.09%\n\n1st\n\n+5.52%\n\n2,551,065\n\n54.62%\n\n+6.82%\n\nWon\n\n\n\nGain\n\n\n\n\nIndependence\n\n\n\nConservative\n\n109,027\n\n2.33%\n\n4th\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nLiberal\n\n\n\nRight to Life\n\n55,724\n\n1.19%\n\n6th\n\n-1.03%\n\n\n2004\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nHoward Mills\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\n4,384,907\n\n65.42%\n\n1st\n\n+14.33%\n\n4,769,824\n\n71.2%\n\n+16.58%\n\nWon\n\n\n\nHold\n\n\n\n\nIndependence\n\n216,198\n\n3.23%\n\n4th\n\n+0.9%\n\n\n\n\nWorking Families\n\n168,719\n\n2.52%\n\n5th\n\nN/A\n\n\n2010\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nJay Townsend\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\n2,686,043\n\n58.47%\n\n1st\n\n-6.95%\n\n3,047,111\n\n66.33%\n\n-4.87%\n\nWon\n\n\n\nHold\n\n\n\n\nWorking Families\n\n183,672\n\n4.00%\n\n4th\n\n+1.48%\n\n\n\n\nIndependence\n\n\n\nConservative\n\n177,396\n\n3.86%\n\n5th\n\n+0.63%\n\n\n2016\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nWendy Long\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\n4,784,218\n\n64.72%\n\n1st\n\n+6.25%\n\n5,221,945\n\n70.64%\n\n+4.31%\n\nWon\n\n\n\nHold\n\n\n\n\nWorking Families\n\n241,672\n\n3.27%\n\n4th\n\n-0.73%\n\n\n\n\nIndependence\n\n\n\nConservative\n\n150,654\n\n2.04%\n\n5th\n\n-1.82%\n\n\n\n\nWomen's Equality\n\n\n\nReform\n\n45,401\n\n0.61%\n\n6th\n\nN/A\n\n\n2022\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nJoe Pinion\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\n3,022,822\n\n51.69%\n\n1st\n\n-13.03%\n\n3,320,561\n\n56.78%\n\n-13.86\n\nWon\n\n\n\nHold\n\n\n\n\nWorking Families\n\n\n\nConservative\n\n297,739\n\n5.09%\n\n3rd\n\n+1.82%\n\n\n\n\nHonorary degrees\nSchumer has been awarded several honorary degrees in recognition of his political career.
