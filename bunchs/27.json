    "wiki": "American journalist\nLauren DucaDuca in 2017Born (1991-02-24) February 24, 1991 (age\u00a032)New York City, New York, U.S.NationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materFordham UniversityNew York UniversityOccupationJournalistYears\u00a0active2016\u20132020\nLauren Duca (born February 24, 1991)[1] is an American former journalist and political columnist.[2][3] She formerly worked at Teen Vogue, where she had a column from 2017 to 2018 called \"Thigh High Politics\". Her book How to Start a Revolution (2019) is on young people and the future of American politics.[4]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nDuca was born in New York City and grew up in an affluent New Jersey suburb. Her parents live in New Jersey,[3] and she has a younger brother.[5]\nIn 2013, Duca graduated from Fordham University with a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy.[6] During this time, she was editor in chief of the alternative newspaper, the paper.[7] In 2015, Duca received her master's degree in journalism and critical theory from New York University.[8]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 2013, Duca got her start working as an online editorial intern for New York Magazine. From 2013 to 2015, Duca worked as a reporter at The Huffington Post. In 2015, she began working as a freelance reporter, often writing for Teen Vogue.\nIn December 2016, Duca drew attention for an op-ed in Teen Vogue titled \"Donald Trump is Gaslighting America,\"[9][10] which argued that then President-elect Donald Trump relied on deceit to undermine the truth so his critics would question their own judgment.[2] As of December 23, 2016, the essay had been viewed 1.2\u00a0million times, becoming the magazine's most-viewed post.[11] Katie Mettler of The Washington Post said, \"[T]he Internet lit up with praise for [Duca's] 'scorched-earth' op-ed.\"[12] The essay was widely cited as a turning point in the fashion magazine's reputation, with a newly recognized political dimension.[11][13][14]\nDuca appeared on Tucker Carlson Tonight on December 23, 2016,[15] and in the heated exchange over her commentary on Ivanka Trump,[16] Duca criticized host Tucker Carlson for not allowing her to speak and called Carlson a \"partisan hack.\" In response, he told her that instead of political commentary, she \"should stick to the thigh-high boots,\" referring to her earlier articles on pop star Ariana Grande.[17] Online harassment of Duca followed, including threats of sexual assault.[18]\nIn response, Duca named her new column at Teen Vogue, begun in February 2017,[2] \"Thigh-High Politics.\"[19] According to the magazine, \"Thigh High Politics\" \"[broke] down the news, provides resources for the resistance, and just generally refuses to accept toxic nonsense.\"[20] She also designed a t-shirt in July 2017 with the phrase \"I like my politics thigh-high,\" and donated all of the proceeds from each $32 shirt to Planned Parenthood in Carlson's name.[21] As of December 2017, over $10,000 were raised.[22] In the face of backlash against Teen Vogue, Duca has defended the political commentary featured on the website, citing the disconnect between critics who find young women's interests as too silly for intellectual conversation and the reprimand young women face for not participating in political process.[5]\nIn 2017, former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli attempted to contact Duca a number of times and referenced her routinely in social media. In early January 2017, Shkreli direct-messaged Duca, tweeted her directly, edited a collage of Duca for his Twitter banner, and superimposed his face on top of an image of Duca and her then-husband to use as his profile photo.[23] Duca made her discomfort in Shkreli's advances known on her Twitter, posting a screenshot of a direct message from Shkreli inviting her to Donald Trump's inauguration with the caption, \u201cI would rather eat my own organs.\u201d[24] Duca also posted screenshots of Shkreli's Twitter profile using her appearance, asking the platform's founder and CEO Jack Dorsey how Shkreli's actions were allowed.[25] Shkreli's Twitter account was then suspended for violating the website's rules prohibiting targeted harassment.[26] On July 28, 2017, Duca released a Twitter statement on her thoughts regarding Shkreli's securities-fraud trial and his sexual comments on a Facebook livestream.[27] Duca tweeted, \"I would (still) rather eat my own organs. So much as touch me, and I'll gladly chop off one of yours.\"[28]\nOn 21 February 2018, Duca responded to Billy Graham's death by tweeting: \"The big news today is that Billy Graham was still alive this whole time. Anyway, have fun in hell, bitch.\"[29] Her post drew some backlash on the internet.[30] In response to Fox News' coverage of her tweet, Duca noted: \"The Fox article and segment on my stupid tweet are really miraculous in their bad-faith consternation. Billy Graham called being gay 'a sinister form of perversion,' and floated the idea that 'AIDS is a punishment from God.' If hell is real, that's exactly where he's headed.\"[31]\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Duca would be a visiting scholar at New York University's journalism department.[32][33] In the summer of 2019, Duca taught a six-week course there entitled \"The Feminist Journalist.\" The class was taught under the NYU Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute and focused on intersections of feminist ideology and the practice of journalism, and was made up of high-school and college students.[34] Four weeks after the course, students sent a collective formal complaint to school's journalism department regarding Duca's conduct during the class, writing, \"We are disappointed at the department and NYU for hiring a professor with more interest in promoting her book than teaching a group of students eager to learn.\"[35] Students allege that Duca targeted an exchange student, writing that she \"consistently targeted this student on the basis of a communication difficulty the student cannot change.[35][36]\nIn September 2019, Duca released her first book, which was called How to Start a Revolution: Young People and the Future of American Politics.[4]\nIn September 2020, Duca announced her indefinite hiatus from journalism.[37]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nDuca lives in Brooklyn[38] with her pet Shiba Inu, Demi.[3] Duca was married to Kris Fleming,[8][39] but announced on Twitter on January 13, 2019, that she was getting divorced from her husband. Since her divorce, Duca has identified as queer,[40] and announced her second marriage on September 5, 2020.[41]\n\nHonors[edit]\n2015: Los Angeles Press Club, National Arts and Entertainment Journalism Award, Online \u2013 Film/TV/Theater Feature for \"The Rise of the Woman-Child\"[42]\n2017: Citizens' Committee for Children, Vanguard Award[43]\n2017: Shorty Awards, Best in Journalism[44]\nSelected works and publications[edit]\nDuca, Lauren (17 December 2014). \"How Pop Culture Can Change The Way We Talk About Abortion\".

She is former health commissioner for the city of Baltimore and former president of Planned Parenthood. She has written two books based on her experiences as a medical professional.\nWen has served as a public health communicator during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2022 mpox outbreak, appearing frequently on CNN as an on-air medical analyst.[1][2][3]\nWen was asked to testify four times to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic, including twice to the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis.[4]\nCurrently, Wen serves as a public health professor at George Washington University and is a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. She is also a columnist for The Washington Post and a medical analyst for CNN.[5]\n\n\nEarly life and family[edit]\nBorn Wen Linyan (\u6e29\u9e9f\u884d) in Shanghai, China on January 27, 1983,[6] to Ying Sandy Zhang and Xiaolu Wen,[7] Wen moved with her parents to the U.S. when she was eight, by then having the English name Leana Sheryle Wen.[8] Granted political asylum, the Wen family lived in Compton and East Los Angeles in Southern California.[9][10][11] In 2003, Wen and her family became U.S. citizens.[10]\nWen's mother, who died of breast cancer in 2010, first worked as a hotel room cleaner and video store clerk before becoming an elementary school teacher.[11][12] Her father delivered newspapers and was a dishwasher, later serving as technology manager for The Chinese Daily News in Los Angeles.[13][11]\nWen married South Africa native Sebastian Neil Walker in Boston in February 2012, after a blessing ceremony in Cape Town in November 2011.[13] They have two children: a son born in 2017 and a daughter born in 2020.[14][15]\n\nEducation[edit]\nAs a result of her own asthma attacks as a child and seeing a neighbor's child die of an asthma attack, Wen decided that she wanted to become an emergency room physician.[16]\nAttending the Early Entrance Program (EEP) at California State University, Los Angeles starting at age 13, Wen graduated summa cum laude at age 18 with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry, in 2001.[17][7][9] She received a Doctor of Medicine from Washington University School of Medicine and has two master's degrees, one in Economic and Social History and another in Modern Chinese Studies,[18] both from the Merton College, Oxford in England where she was a Rhodes Scholar. She also met her future husband, Sebastian Walker, during her time in England.[13]\nIn 2005, Wen took a one-year leave of absence from medical school to serve as the national president of the American Medical Student Association,[7] where she led campaigns to increase healthcare access, decrease health disparities, and combat conflicts of interest between physicians and the pharmaceutical companies who notoriously use attractive sales representatives and free gifts to influence doctors, especially young interns and medical residents.[19][20] Wen became involved in U.S. and international health policy during medical school, serving in Geneva, Switzerland as a fellow for the World Health Organization and in Rwanda as a fellow for the U.S. Department of Defense.[7] In addition, she advised the U.S. Congress on physician workforce and medical education through her appointment on the Council on Graduate Medical Education by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.[9][21]\n\nCareer[edit]\nEmergency medicine[edit]\nFollowing medical school, Wen completed a residency at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Massachusetts General Hospital (Mass General) and a clinical fellowship at Harvard Medical School in Boston. She is board certified in emergency medicine. Wen started working in emergency medicine at BWH and Mass General before moving to the ER at the George Washington University (GW) in Washington, DC,[18][13] where she became a professor in emergency and health policy, and the Director of Patient-Centered Care Research.[22] She served as a consultant to the Brookings Institution and the China Medical Board, and conducted international health systems research including in South Africa, Slovenia, Nigeria, Singapore, and China.[23]\n\nBaltimore City health commissioner[edit]\nFrom December 2014 until October 2018, Wen served as the health commissioner for Baltimore City under two mayors.[24] She was first appointed by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake; in December 2016, she was reappointed by Mayor Catherine Pugh. She resigned in 2018, when she was appointed head of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.[25]\nIn her role as commissioner, Wen oversaw the Baltimore City Health Department, an agency of 1,100 employees and $130her million annual budget with wide-ranging responsibilities, including management of acute communicable diseases, animal control, chronic disease prevention, emergency preparedness, food service inspections, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, maternal-child health, school health, senior services, and youth violence issues.\nShe directed the city's public health recovery efforts after the 2015 Baltimore riots, including ensuring prescription medication access to seniors after the closure of 13 pharmacies, and developing the Mental Health/Trauma Recovery Plan, with 24-hour crisis counseling, and healing circles and group counseling in schools, community groups, and churches.[26][27]\nFollowing the riots, the Baltimore City Health Department team launched numerous campaigns, including a citywide trauma response plan, youth health and wellness strategy, violence prevention programs, B'Healthy in B'More blog, and B'More Health Talks, a biweekly town hall and podcast series on health disparities.[9][28][29][30][31]\nIn March 2018, on behalf of Wen and the Baltimore City Health Department, the City of Baltimore sued the Trump administration for cutting teen pregnancy prevention funds, which resulted in a federal judge ordering the Trump administration to restore $5 million in grant funding to two Baltimore-based teen pregnancy prevention programs.[32] She wrote an opinion editorial criticizing proposed changes to the Title X program which would affect health clinics in Baltimore providing reproductive health care for low income women.[33]  This court decision was later reversed by the 9th Circuit court, enabling the Trump administration to withhold Title X funding for abortion.\n\nOpioid overdose epidemic response[edit]\nWen has led implementation of the Baltimore opioid overdose prevention and response plan, which includes a blanket prescription for the opioid antidote, naloxone; \"hotspotting\" and street outreach teams to target individuals most at risk; training family/friends on naloxone use; and launching a new public education campaign.[citation needed] Wen testified to the U.S. Senate HELP Committee and U.S. House Oversight Committee on Baltimore's overdose prevention efforts. She led a group of state and city health officials to petition the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on adding black box warnings to opioids and benzodiazepines.[34][35] In March 2016, she was invited by the White House to join President Barack Obama and CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta on a panel discussion, where she spoke about Baltimore's response.[36] She convened doctors and public health leaders to sign the Baltimore Statement on the Importance of Childhood Vaccinations[37] and to successfully advocate to ban the sale of powdered alcohol in Maryland and synthetic drugs in Baltimore.[38][39]\nCongressman Elijah Cummings cited Wen's efforts to combat the opioid epidemic in Baltimore and sought her help in creating national legislation to change how the United States fights it.[40]\nIn 2018, the National Association of County and City Health Officials awarded the Baltimore City Health Department the Local Health Department of the Year.[41][42]\n\nPlanned Parenthood[edit]\nOn September 18, 2018, Wen was appointed president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.[43][25] She was the first medical doctor to serve in the role in nearly 50 years and was the first woman doctor ever to do so.[44] In an interview with Elle magazine, Wen described her excitement to be at the helm of the organization where both she and her mother had received significant medical care many years prior.[45]\nWen envisioned a new direction for discourse surrounding Planned Parenthood, endeavoring to frame abortion access as an issue of healthcare rather than politics.[44] She also wanted to expand the services provided by Planned Parenthood clinics to include treatment for medical concerns unrelated to reproduction, especially treatment for opioid addiction and easy access to Naloxone (in keeping with her former work as Health Commissioner in Baltimore).[44] In an op-ed for the New York Times after her departure from the organization, she described her initial goal as \"finding common ground with the large majority of Americans who can unite behind the goal of improving the health and well-being of women and children.\"[45] Wen's appointment and proposed strategic plan received mixed reviews, with commentators on both sides of the political spectrum both praising her novel approach and criticizing it as \"backing away from the fight [for abortion access].\"[44]\nWen's tenure at Planned Parenthood saw many major events with implications for reproductive healthcare, starting with the confirmation hearings and appointment to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, and ending with the implementation of the nationwide Title X gag rule under the Trump-Pence administration. This legislation prevented medical providers who received funding from Title X from referring patients for abortion services and also prohibited the performance of abortions in the same facility as providers who received Title X funding (the rule was later overturned in 2021 by the Biden-Harris administration).[46] The period also saw a marked increase in the number of laws passed at the state level that restricted access to abortions.[47]\nAs president of Planned Parenthood, Wen worked to expand non-abortion services like maternal health and mental health services and to rebrand Planned Parenthood from its image as an abortion rights advocate to a comprehensive women's health organization that serves women and families.[48] She spoke out about her own experiences as a cervical cancer survivor who struggled with infertility, and about a miscarriage she suffered while in the role.[49][14]\nIn July 2019, Wen was forced to resign from her position after only 8 months.[50] The board gave no reason, but sources cited a dispute over management and organizational philosophy. Other sources alluded to Wen's incompatibilities with the organization on an interpersonal level, citing organization members' difficulty adapting to her leadership style.[51] In a letter to Planned Parenthood affiliates, Wen claimed philosophical differences in the direction of the organization.[52][51]\nOn July 19, 2019, Wen published an opinion editorial in The New York Times which set forth the circumstances underlying her departure from Planned Parenthood. She attributed her sudden departure more specifically to disagreements over the centrality of abortion in the mission of Planned Parenthood and stated her view that \"As one of the few national health care organizations with a presence in all 50 states, Planned Parenthood's mandate should be to promote reproductive health care as part of a wide range of policies that affect women's health and public health.\"[45] Echoing her earlier statements, she described her goal to focus on the more holistic elements of the organization, while the board instead wanted to focus on the political debate surrounding abortion rights.[45]\n\nTeaching and research[edit]\nIn August 2019, it was announced that Wen would join the Milken Institute School of Public Health (Milken Institute SPH) at the George Washington University (GW) as a visiting professor of health policy and management. She was also named a distinguished fellow in the Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity (Mullan Institute), where she focused on advancing \"interdisciplinary research and education, participating in the trainings of the Mullan Institute\u2019s fellowship programs and enhancing the school\u2019s educational opportunities in the areas of maternal and child health, women\u2019s health and health equity.\".[53][54] She is also a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.[55]\n\nJournalism[edit]\nThe Washington Post[edit]\nWen started writing for The Washington Post as a contributing op-ed writer in 2019. Her role as a columnist became formalized in 2020, and she began anchoring a weekly newsletter on public health and healthcare called The Checkup with Dr. Wen.[56][57] Her commentaries for the Post started with a heavy focus on COVID-19 and have touched on a range of other issues, including the nursing shortage, the opioid epidemic, reemergence of polio, cancer, mental health, obesity, marijuana, and other public health and policy topics.[58] In 2023, Wen received attention for a piece claiming that Covid deaths were being over counted, with some claiming vindication after claims of over counting deaths were decried as conspiracy theories years earlier.[59]\n\nCNN[edit]\nWen has appeared frequently on CNN during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2022 monkeypox outbreak as an on-air medical analyst.[1][2][3]\n\nPatient advocacy[edit]\nIn 2013, St. Martin's Press published her book, When Doctors Don't Listen: How to Avoid Misdiagnoses and Unnecessary Tests with coauthor Joshua Kosowsky.

(July 2023)\nLina KhanOfficial portrait, 2021Chair of the Federal Trade CommissionIncumbentAssumed office June 15, 2021PresidentJoe BidenPreceded byRebecca Slaughter (acting)Commissioner of the Federal Trade CommissionIncumbentAssumed office June 15, 2021PresidentJoe BidenPreceded byJoseph Simons\nPersonal detailsBorn (1989-03-03) March 3, 1989 (age\u00a034)London, EnglandSpouse\n Shah Ali \u200b(m.\u00a02018)\u200bChildren1EducationWilliams College (BA)Yale University (JD)Signature\nLina M. Khan (born March 3, 1989) is a British-born American legal scholar serving as chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) since 2021.  She is also an associate professor of law at Columbia Law School.\nWhile a student at Yale Law School, she became known for her work in antitrust and competition law in the United States after publishing the influential essay \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\".[1]\nShe was nominated by President Joe Biden to the Commission in March 2021, and has served since June 2021 following her confirmation. During her tenure as chairwoman, the FTC has pushed to ban non-compete agreements, filed lawsuits against health care companies engaging in anti-competitive practices, and launched a high-profile lawsuit against Amazon.[2] In 2022, the FTC and the DOJ's anti-trust division blocked a record number of mergers on anti-trust grounds.[3]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nKhan was born on March 3, 1989, in London, to a British family of Pakistani origin.[4][5] Khan grew up in Golders Green in the London Borough of Barnet. Her parents, a management consultant and an employee of Thomson Reuters, moved to the United States when she was 11 years old. The family settled in Mamaroneck, New York, where she and her brother attended public school.[6] Khan said that her parents experienced racism and xenophobia in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.[7]\nAt Mamaroneck High School, Khan was involved in the student newspaper.[8] After high school, Khan studied political science at Williams College in Massachusetts. She also attended the University of Oxford as an undergraduate visiting student at Exeter College.[9] Khan served as editor of the Williams College student newspaper and wrote her senior thesis on Hannah Arendt. She graduated in 2010 with a Bachelor of Arts.\n\nAdvocacy and academic career[edit]\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Khan worked at the New America Foundation, where she engaged in anti-monopoly research and writing for Barry Lynn at the Open Markets Program.[6] Lynn was looking for a researcher without a background in economics, and he began critiquing market consolidation with Khan's help.[6]\nAs a result of her work at the Open Markets Institute, Khan was offered a reporting position at The Wall Street Journal, where she would have covered commodities. During the same period, Khan was offered admission into Yale Law School. Describing it as \"a real 'choose the path' moment\", Khan ultimately chose to enroll at Yale.[6]\nKhan served as a submissions editor for the Yale Journal on Regulation. She went on to graduate from Yale in 2017 with a Juris Doctor degree.[4][10]\n\n\"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\"[edit]\nKhan in 2016, speaking on a panel about Amazon and antitrust law\nIn 2017, during her third year at Yale Law School, the Yale Law Journal published Khan's student article \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\".[11] The article made a significant impact in American legal and business circles, and the New York Times described it as \"reframing decades of monopoly law\".[4]\nIn the article, Khan argued that the current American antitrust law framework, which focuses on keeping consumer prices down, cannot account for the anticompetitive effects of platform-based business models such as that of Amazon. The title of Khan's piece was a reference to Robert Bork's 1978 book The Antitrust Paradox, which established the consumer-welfare standard that Khan critiqued.[6] She proposed alternative frameworks for antitrust policy, including \"restoring traditional antitrust and competition policy principles or applying common carrier obligations and duties.\"[11][6]\nFor \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\", Khan won the Antitrust Writing Award for \"Best Academic Unilateral Conduct Article\" in 2018,[12] the Israel H. Peres Prize by Yale Law School,[12] and the Michael Egger Prize from the Yale Law Journal.[12]\n\nReception[edit]\nThe article was met with both acclaim and criticism. As of September 2018, it received 146,255 hits, \"a runaway best-seller in the world of legal treatises,\" according to the New York Times.[4] Makan Delrahim, then serving as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division under Donald Trump, praised Khan for her \u201cfresh thinking on how our legal tools apply to new digital platforms.\u201d[13]\nJoshua Wright, who served on the FTC from 2013 to 2015, derided her work as \"hipster antitrust\" and argued it \"reveal[ed] a profound lack of understanding of the consumer welfare model and the rule of reason framework.\"[14] Herbert Hovenkamp wrote that Khan's claims are \"technically undisciplined, untestable, and even incoherent\", and that her work \"never explains how a nonmanufacturing retailer such as Amazon could ever recover its investment in below cost pricing by later raising prices, and even disputes that raising prices to higher levels ever needs to be a part of the strategy, thus indicating that it is confusing predation with investment.\"[15]\n\nOpen Markets Institute and Columbia Law School[edit]\nAfter graduating from law school, Khan worked as legal director at the Open Markets Institute. The institute split from New America after Khan and her team criticized Google's market power, prompting pressure from Google, a funder of New America.[16] During her time at OMI, Khan met with Senator Elizabeth Warren to discuss anti-monopolistic policy ideas.[17]\nInitially planning to clerk for Judge Stephen Reinhardt on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Khan joined Columbia Law School as an academic fellow, where she pursued research and scholarship on antitrust law and competition policy, especially relating to digital platforms.[12][18] She published \u201cThe Separation of Platforms and Commerce\u201d in the Columbia Law Review, making the case for structural separations that prohibit dominant intermediaries from entering lines of business that place them in direct competition with the businesses dependent on their networks.[19] In July 2020, Khan joined the school's faculty as an associate professor of law.[20]\nKhan has described herself as belonging to the New Brandeis movement, a political movement that seeks a revival in antitrust enforcement.[21]\n\nEarly government service[edit]\nIn 2018, Khan worked as a legal fellow at the Federal Trade Commission in the office of Commissioner Rohit Chopra.[22] In 2019, she began serving as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, where she led the congressional investigation into digital markets.[23]\n\nChairwoman of the FTC[edit]\nOn March 22, 2021, Joe Biden announced that he was nominating Khan to be a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.[24][25] On June 15, 2021, her nomination was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 69 to 28.[26] Khan was confirmed with bipartisan support, mainly attributed to her \"influential anti-Amazon views\" being widely reflected in Congress.[27] Biden then appointed her chairperson of the FTC.[28] Upon taking office, Khan became the third Asian-American to serve on the FTC, after Dennis Yao (who served from 1991 to 1994) and her former boss Rohit Chopra (who served from 2018 to 2021).[29]\nFollowing her appointment as chairperson, both Amazon[30] and Facebook[31] filed petitions with the FTC seeking her recusal from investigations of the companies, suggesting that her past criticism of the companies left her unable to be impartial. However, according to legal scholar Eleanor Fox, the standard for recusal is very high and unlikely to be met for Khan.[32] Senator Elizabeth Warren and other supporters of Khan argued that the recusal demands amount to an attempt by these companies to intimidate Khan in order to curtail regulatory scrutiny.[33]\nAccording to leaked documents, the FTC's Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO), Lorielle Pankey, did not believe Khan had violated any ethical standards,[34] but still recommended that she recuse herself from the case with Meta to avoid the appearance of bias; this was rejected by Khan and the FTC.[35] The official who made the recommendation was later revealed to have owned Meta stock at that time, prompting concerns about Pankey's own conduct.[36] In response, Khan and the FTC released a unanimous statement in support of Pankey.[37] Earlier in February 2023, FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson announced her resignation from the agency citing her opposition to Khan's leadership, including her refusal to recuse from FTC's lawsuit against Meta.[38]\nOn July 13, 2023, Khan appeared before a Republican-led House committee that questioned her leadership of the agency. The hearing took place shortly after the FTC lost a case blocking the Microsoft takeover of Activision Blizzard.[39][40] Democrats on the committee defended Khan and the actions of the agency, arguing that she was taking steps that protected user privacy.[41]\n\nInfluence[edit]\nIn 2018 Politico described Khan as \"a leader of a new school of antitrust thought\" as part of its \"Politico 50\" list of influential thinkers.[12] New York magazine said she was \"indisputably the most powerful figure in the anti-monopoly vanguard\".[42] She was also listed as one of Foreign Policy's \"Global Thinkers,\"[43] Prospect's \"Top 50 Thinkers,\"[44] Wired's WIRED25,[45] the National Journal 50,[46] Washingtonian's list of most influential women,[47] and Time's \"Next Generation Leaders.\"[48]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nKhan is married to Shah Ali, a cardiologist at Columbia University in Manhattan.[4] In January 2023, Khan gave birth to her first child, a son.[49]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nKhan, Lina M.

As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 8,040.[3]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe founding of the small historical railroad and ranching town of Livingston is a direct result of the Northern Pacific Railway (NPR). This site became a centralized point in the Rockies and the NPR's location for railroad shops to service their steam trains before ascending the Bozeman Pass, the line's highest point, located immediately west. Livingston also became the first gateway town to America's first national park, Yellowstone, which the NPR promoted heavily to visitors from the East. The NPR also operated a branch line running 50 miles south through Paradise Valley, first to Cinnabar station and later to Yellowstone's north entrance in Gardiner.\n\nLivingston, Montana's Main Street was shown on a postcard mailed in 1924.\nClark City[edit]\nThis section does not cite any sources.

(May 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nDownstream the Yellowstone River, about 3 miles from present-day Livingston, an old fisherman named Amos Benson built a log cabin in 1872. This is where a ferry, a trading post and a small community called Benson's Landing were located.[4] Across the river from Benson's Landing in June 1882 was the camp of about 40 tents of the Northern Pacific survey crew. This is where they thought the supply store site they were looking for should be. On July 14, 1882, a man who worked for the Northern Pacific named Joseph J. McBride arrived with orders to find another site to build the store. On July 16, George H. Carver, who became a major local businessman and political leader, arrived at the site of present-day Livingston. Carver and McBride became the first local residents when they pitched their tents on the 16th. Also on the 16th arrived 30 freight wagons drawn by 140 oxen, carrying 140,000 lbs. of merchandise. The supply store was to be of Bruns and Kruntz, contractors. Eventually, the tents gave way to log cabins. All of Benson's Landing encampment moved up the river to Carver and McBride's camp within 10 days of the train's arrival.\nThis new settlement was called \"Clark City\" after Heman Clark, the principal contractor for the Northern Pacific from the Missouri westward. By fall, the town was well established and a November 1882 poll counted 348 votes for delegates to congress. Clark City was on the southeast side at the East end of Lewis St. just southwest of the KPRK, and is now part of Livingston. B.F. Downen built the first permanent residence (out of wood) and Frank White owned the first saloon. Clark City eventually had 6 general stores, 2 hotels, 2 restaurants, 2 watchmakers, 2 wholesale liquor dealers, 2 meat markets, 3 blacksmiths, 1 hardware store, 30 saloons and a population of 500.\nAs Clark City was growing, nobody realized that the Northern Pacific had marked on its maps a town called Livingston at the same place. The railroad officially reached Clark City on November 22, 1882. In October 1882 a post office was chartered for Clark City. In November, Livingston received its charter. That was when it was decided that Livingston be located a short distance away. Then Clark City residents bought lots in Livingston and moved. The birth of Livingston was the death of Clark City. The walking distance between them was considerable and Clark City became stream-and-bog urban wildland. Very few buildings still remain.\n\nIncorporation[edit]\nTeslow Grain Elevator, along the railroad tracks\nOn December 21, 1882, Livingston was incorporated and named in honor of Johnston Livingston, pioneer Northern Pacific Railway stockholder, director and friend of Northern Pacific Railroad President Henry Villard. Johnston Livingston was director from 1875 to 1881 and 1884\u20131887. Crawford Livingston Jr., Johnston's nephew, is more commonly considered the town's namesake. Crawford bought the real estate after the survey and on July 17, 1883, established the First National Bank in the city. Often he spoke of Livingston as \"his town,\" and he apparently enjoyed the publicity of supposedly having a city named for him. But the name Livingston has always stood out in the Northern Pacific official family.[5]\nLivingston is along the Yellowstone River, where it bends from north to east toward Billings and in proximity to Interstate 90. In July 1806 Captain William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped on the city's present outskirts on the return trip east preparing to descend the Yellowstone River. Clark's party rejoined the Lewis party at the confluence with the Missouri River, near Williston, North Dakota.\n\nAttractions[edit]\nAlthough small, Livingston has a number of popular tourist attractions. The Livingston Depot, built in 1902 after two predecessors, is a restored rail station that houses a railroad museum open from May to September. The Yellowstone Gateway Museum documents regional history from one of the oldest North American archaeological sites to Wild Western and Yellowstone history. The International Fly Fishing Federation's museum is an extensive introduction to a popular game sport and hosts annual enthusiast meetings. The city was inhabited for two decades by Calamity Jane and visited by a number of traveling members of European royalty.\nIn 1938, Dan Bailey, an eastern fly-fisherman, established Dan Bailey's Fly Shop and mail order fly tying business on Park Street.[6] Also in Livingston is the Fly Fishing Discovery Center, a museum operated by the Federation of Fly Fishers.[7] Actors Peter Fonda and Margot Kidder, Saturday Night Live alumnus Rich Hall, musician Ron Strykert, novelist Walter Kirn, and poet Jim Harrison have lived in the city. Jimmy Buffett mentions Livingston in multiple songs.\nIts economy is flat, and like the rest of the state, the unemployment rate is below the national average. Almost 50% of its workforce commutes to Bozeman,[citation needed] as well as the destination resort Chico Hot Springs 25 miles south, and various campsites and ranches in Paradise Valley. Recently the city has invested in attractions and accommodation for tourists visiting during the Lewis and Clark bicentennial years.\nLivingston and its immediately adjacent area has 17 sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places, enumerated within Park County's NRHP listings.\nIt has a sister-city relationship with Naganohara, Japan.\n\nImages of Livingston, Montana\n\n\nPlat of Livingston, 1883\n\n\n\nGateway to Yellowstone, Frank Jay Haynes, 1884\n\n\n\nSecond Livingston NPRR Depot, 1894\n\n\n\nResidential neighborhood\n\n\n\nFire station reincarnated as fitness center\n\n\nGeography[edit]\nGolf course, Livingston, Montana\nLivingston is located at 45\u00b039\u203232\u2033N 110\u00b033\u203249\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff45.65889\u00b0N 110.56361\u00b0W\ufeff / 45.65889; -110.56361 (45.658840, -110.563718),[8] at an elevation of 4,501 feet (1372\u00a0m).[9]\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.03 square miles (15.62\u00a0km2), of which 6.02 square miles (15.59\u00a0km2) is land and 0.01 square miles (0.03\u00a0km2) is water.[10]\n\nClimate[edit]\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Livingston has a warm-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated \"Dfb\" on climate maps.\n\n\n\n\nClimate data for Livingston, Montana (Livingston Airport), 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1948\u2013present\n\n\nMonth\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\nYear\n\n\nRecord high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n\n67(19)\n\n70(21)\n\n75(24)\n\n86(30)\n\n93(34)\n\n99(37)\n\n104(40)\n\n105(41)\n\n102(39)\n\n91(33)\n\n77(25)\n\n64(18)\n\n105(41)\n\n\nMean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n\n55.7(13.2)\n\n57.3(14.1)\n\n67.6(19.8)\n\n76.2(24.6)\n\n82.5(28.1)\n\n91.0(32.8)\n\n97.8(36.6)\n\n97.0(36.1)\n\n92.3(33.5)\n\n80.8(27.1)\n\n65.3(18.5)\n\n55.5(13.1)\n\n99.1(37.3)\n\n\nMean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n\n37.4(3.0)\n\n38.9(3.8)\n\n47.8(8.8)\n\n54.4(12.4)\n\n64.4(18.0)\n\n73.8(23.2)\n\n85.7(29.8)\n\n84.8(29.3)\n\n73.5(23.1)\n\n58.2(14.6)\n\n44.9(7.2)\n\n36.4(2.4)\n\n58.4(14.6)\n\n\nDaily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n\n28.1(\u22122.2)\n\n28.9(\u22121.7)\n\n36.1(2.3)\n\n42.2(5.7)\n\n51.0(10.6)\n\n59.3(15.2)\n\n67.9(19.9)\n\n66.5(19.2)\n\n57.3(14.1)\n\n45.5(7.5)\n\n35.1(1.7)\n\n27.6(\u22122.4)\n\n45.5(7.5)\n\n\nMean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n\n18.8(\u22127.3)\n\n18.9(\u22127.3)\n\n24.3(\u22124.3)\n\n30.0(\u22121.1)\n\n37.6(3.1)\n\n44.8(7.1)\n\n50.2(10.1)\n\n48.1(8.9)\n\n41.2(5.1)\n\n32.7(0.4)\n\n25.3(\u22123.7)\n\n18.8(\u22127.3)\n\n32.6(0.3)\n\n\nMean minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n\n\u22129.4(\u221223.0)\n\n\u22126.9(\u221221.6)\n\n1.2(\u221217.1)\n\n14.8(\u22129.6)\n\n23.2(\u22124.9)\n\n33.6(0.9)\n\n40.0(4.4)\n\n36.9(2.7)\n\n27.1(\u22122.7)\n\n11.6(\u221211.3)\n\n\u22121.7(\u221218.7)\n\n\u22128.7(\u221222.6)\n\n\u221220.5(\u221229.2)\n\n\nRecord low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n\n\u221232(\u221236)\n\n\u221233(\u221236)\n\n\u221232(\u221236)\n\n\u22122(\u221219)\n\n11(\u221212)\n\n27(\u22123)\n\n33(1)\n\n28(\u22122)\n\n10(\u221212)\n\n\u221212(\u221224)\n\n\u221231(\u221235)\n\n\u221241(\u221241)\n\n\u221241(\u221241)\n\n\nAverage precipitation inches (mm)\n\n0.44(11)\n\n0.47(12)\n\n0.79(20)\n\n1.71(43)\n\n2.66(68)\n\n2.42(61)\n\n1.31(33)\n\n1.07(27)\n\n1.20(30)\n\n1.36(35)\n\n0.62(16)\n\n0.50(13)\n\n14.55(369)\n\n\nAverage snowfall inches (cm)\n\n10.4(26)\n\n6.2(16)\n\n7.3(19)\n\n7.6(19)\n\n2.5(6.4)\n\n0.0(0.0)\n\n0.0(0.0)\n\n0.0(0.0)\n\n0.9(2.3)\n\n5.1(13)\n\n7.5(19)\n\n8.5(22)\n\n56.0(142)\n\n\nAverage precipitation days (\u2265 0.01 in)\n\n5.5\n\n6.5\n\n8.4\n\n11.8\n\n13.6\n\n12.9\n\n9.2\n\n7.8\n\n7.5\n\n9.5\n\n7.1\n\n6.3\n\n106.1\n\n\nAverage snowy days (\u2265 0.1 in)\n\n5.4\n\n4.8\n\n6.6\n\n6.9\n\n1.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.9\n\n3.4\n\n5.2\n\n5.4\n\n39.9\n\n\nSource 1: NOAA[11]\n\n\nSource 2: National Weather Service[12]\n\n\nLivingston has some of the warmest winters in the state, but the temperature can feel cold because Livingston is also one of the windiest places in the United States, having the 2nd highest average wind speed among airport/AMOS stations from 2000 to 2010.[13]\n\nDemographics[edit]\n\n\nHistorical population\nCensusPop.Note%\u00b1\n18902,850\u201419002,778\u22122.5%19105,25989.3%19206,31120.0%19306,3911.3%19406,6423.9%19507,68315.7%19608,2297.1%19706,883\u221216.4%19806,9941.6%19906,701\u22124.2%20006,8512.2%20107,0442.8%20208,04014.1%U.S. Decennial Census[14]\n\n2010 census[edit]\nAs of the census[15] of 2010, there were 7,044 people, 3,356 households, and 1,744 families living in the city.
