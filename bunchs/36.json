SimonHeadquartersUnited StatesKey peopleAubrey ChernickRoger L. SimonProductsPJ Media, PJTVOwnerSalem Media GroupWebsitepjmedia.com\nPJ Media, originally known as Pajamas Media, is an American right-wing[1] subscription-based[2] commentary website. It was founded in 2004, with its majority owner being software entrepreneur, billionaire[3] and angel investor Aubrey Chernick, founder of Candle Corporation (acquired by IBM).[4] Salem Media Group acquired the company in March 2019.[5] PJ Media also operated the online television and video network PJTV, which ceased operations on May 11, 2016.[4]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nPJ Media was founded as Pajamas Media in 2004 by Charles Johnson, the blogger behind Little Green Footballs, and screenwriter and producer Roger L. Simon, after Johnson's contribution to the Killian documents controversy investigation in 2004, in which he helped lead to the retraction of a 60 Minutes story critical of President George W. Bush's service in the Air National Guard and Dan Rather's resignation from CBS News. Johnson and Simon set out to challenge the mainstream media with a network of citizen-journalists.[6][7][8]  The network was primarily made up of conservatives and libertarians.[9] The network's original name was derived from a dismissive comment made by former CBS news executive Jonathan Klein during the 2004 Killian documents affair: \"You couldn't have a starker contrast between the multiple layers of checks and balances at 60 Minutes and a guy sitting in his living room in his pajamas.\"[10][11]\nPajamas Media received venture capital funding on 14 November 2005. Pajamas used this funding for its operations and marketing while expanding its news and opinion coverage. Investors in this round of financing included Aubrey Chernick, an angel investor and technology entrepreneur, James Koshland, a venture capitalist, and a partnership formed by DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary.[12]  It rebranded as Open Source Media shortly thereafter and had a launch party that included a keynote address by former New York Times journalist Judith Miller, presentations from John Podhoretz of Commentary magazine, Andrew Breitbart, Elizabeth Hayt of the New York Times, David Corn of The Nation and others. Less than a week after its official launch Open Source Media changed its name back to Pajamas Media after discovering that Public Radio International distributed a radio show called Open Source produced by Open Source Media, Inc.[13]\nJohnson and Pajamas split in 2007 by mutual agreement; Johnson's stake was bought out.[14][15] In October 2011, Pajamas Media changed its name to PJ Media.[16] In September 2013, former congressman Allen West left PJ Media after he had an altercation with a female staffer and allegedly called her a \"Jewish American princess\".[17] West denied being fired and said he left voluntarily.[17]\n\nFalse claims[edit]\nIn August 2018, PJ Media published an article by then supervising editor Paula Bolyard,[18] claiming that Google was manipulating its algorithm to prioritize left-leaning news outlets in their coverage of President Trump.[19] Bolyard acknowledged that her study was \"not scientific\", although she did conclude that \"the results suggest a pattern of bias against right-leaning content.\" Fact checkers at PolitiFact rated this claim false.[20]\nIn January 2019, PJ Media published a column by their senior editor Tyler O'Neil[21] in which he insinuated in his article that a Muslim community patrol in New York City might be enforcing Sharia Law and might be linked to the NYPD.[22] This group, the  Muslim Community Patrol Service (MCPS)[23] was a certified volunteer Neighborhood watch in Brooklyn, a NYC CERT[24] along with other community patrols such as the Brooklyn Asian Safety Patrol[25] and the Guardian Angels. PJ Media offered nothing that demonstrated the MCPS could, or planned to, \"enforce Sharia law\", beyond engaging in the speculative hypothetical that the MCPS might somehow \"apply [...] Sharia in its community monitoring.\" Fact-checkers at Snopes rated this claim false.[26]\nIn February 2019, PJ Media published a column by one of their writers John Hawkins,[27] also creator of Rightwingnews, in which he stated in an article titled \"The Six Most Bizarre Proposals from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal\",[28] making five out of six claims such as \"getting rid of airplanes\" or \"getting rid of cows\", aim to \"get rid of gas-powered cars in a decade\", call for eliminating carbon emissions in ten years \"without the use of nuclear power\", or \"promise 'economic security' for those 'unwilling to work'\". Fact checkers at NewsGuard rated these five claims false,[29] which can be further verified by the official government resolution H.Res.109 Green New Deal proposed by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.[30]\nIn January 2020, PJ Media published a column by one of their writers,[31] Robert B. Spencer, also founder and director of the anti-Muslim conspiracy blog Jihad Watch, in which he stated that congresswoman Ilhan Omar had given Iran military advice by suggesting it could target Trump hotels, and thus committed treason.[32] Fact-checkers at Snopes rated this claim false.[33]\nIn February 2020, PJ Media published a column by Victoria Taft, one of their writers[34] and a conservative talk show host,[35] in which she stated that President Barack Obama waited until millions were infected and 1000 dead in the U.S. before he declared the Pandemic H1N1/09 virus an emergency.[36] Fact-checkers at Snopes rated this claim false.[37]\nAccording to NewsGuard,[38] articles on PJMedia.com have frequently included distorted or misleading claims,[39] including about the COVID-19 pandemic. A now deleted July 2020 article written by Matt Margolis headlined \"COVID-19 May Soon Lose Status as an 'Epidemic' Under CDC Guidelines\",[40] promoted a misleading claim originally published by JustTheNews.com. Many other websites reported this story by PJ Media.[41][42] After the fact, PJ Media never issued a correction to their original story, but only an update with changes and a new headline \"COVID-19 Will Not Soon Lose Status as an 'Epidemic' Under the CDC\".[43]\nIn August, 2020, PJ Media published an article by their Chicago editor Rick Moran,[44] claiming Democrats were urging presidential candidate Joe Biden not to debate with President Trump because they were concerned with the former vice president's mental stamina.[45] The source for this claim cited on the PJ Media article was from Newsweek, but the article states that the former vice president was advised not to debate Trump, citing \"publicity stunts and disregard for the rules in 2016\" as well as cancelling debates over concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic.[46] Furthermore, the Newsweek article cited by PJ Media makes no mention about any mental stamina. According to CNN, Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo stated that presidential candidate Biden has already agreed to three debates with President Trump in fall 2020.[47]\nIn September 2020, PJ Media published an article by senior editor Tyler O'Neil,[48] claiming that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was promising fewer fires, floods, and hurricanes if he should defeat Donald Trump in November.[49] Though Biden did promise he would solve the climate crisis if elected in November, he did not literally promise fewer catastrophic events. Fact checkers at Snopes rated this claim as false.[50]\nIn September 2022, PJ Media blogger Matt Margolis was the originator of a claim made in a PJ Media article that \u201cThe Obama Foundation stored classified documents in an abandoned furniture warehouse.[51] Snopes[52] called this out as a false claim as both classified and unclassified records from the Obama presidency were temporarily located in Hoffman Estates, a suburb of Chicago, in a building that used to be an old furniture store. However, while the Obama Foundation provided funds to move and store those records, it had neither possession nor control of them, given that they were in the custody of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) from the day Obama left office.  What the PJ Media article failed to mention is that this was an agreement in which the foundation provided funds to move documents, but did not state that the foundation had control or access to those documents.  After further research and scrutiny from other fact-checkers such as USA Today,[53] PJ Media later admitted they made a false claim.[54]\n\nPJTV[edit]\nIn the summer of 2008, Pajamas Media launched PJTV, a subscription based internet television service.[55] The Internet television service debuted at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. PJTV featured shows hosted by commentators such as Bill Whittle, Tammy Bruce, and Glenn Reynolds.[4]\nOn May 11, 2016, PJTV shut down operations after its majority investor Aubrey Chernick pulled out funds.[4]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Flaherty, Joseph. \"David Garcia Staffer Resigns over Old Tweets, Including 'F**k You' to Arizona\".

In 2009, Project Veritas associates published misleading[2] videos that depicted ACORN employees providing advice on concealing illegal activity, causing ACORN to shut down after losing funding;[3] the Attorney General of California cleared ACORN of wrongdoing in 2010,[2] and the associates paid a total of $150,000 in settlements to an ACORN employee who sued for defamation.[2] NPR CEO Vivian Schiller resigned in 2013 after Project Veritas released a deceptively[2][3] edited video portraying another NPR executive making controversial comments about the Tea Party movement and NPR's federal funding.[32] Project Veritas unsuccessfully attempted to mislead The Washington Post into publishing false information about the Roy Moore sexual misconduct allegations in 2017;[33][20] the Post won a Pulitzer Prize after uncovering the operation.[7][34] In 2022, a jury awarded $120,000 against Project Veritas for fraudulent misrepresentation of the nonprofit Democracy Partners.[35]\nAs a non-governmental organization, Project Veritas is financed by conservative fund Donors Trust[2] (which provided over $6.6\u00a0million from 2011 to 2019)[20][36][37] and other supporters, including the Donald J. Trump Foundation.[38] In 2020, The New York Times published an expos\u00e9 detailing Project Veritas's use of spies recruited by Erik Prince to infiltrate \"Democratic congressional campaigns, labor organizations and other groups considered hostile to the Trump agenda\". The Times piece notes O'Keefe's and Prince's close links to the Trump administration, and details contributions such as a $1\u00a0million transfer of funds from an undisclosed source to support their work. The findings were based in part on discovery documents in a case brought by the American Federation of Teachers, Michigan, which had been infiltrated by Project Veritas.[39]\nThe organization's board fired O'Keefe in February 2023 for what it said was financial malfeasance with donor money.[40] In September 2023, Project Veritas suspended all operations after laying off most of its employees.[41] In December of the same year, Hannah Giles, who succeeded O'Keefe as CEO of the organization, resigned.\n\n\nHistory\nProject Veritas founder James O'Keefe\nProject Veritas was founded in June 2010 by James O'Keefe,[1][42] who served as chairman until he separated from the organization in February 2023 amid controversy over his handling of finances and his management style.[40][43]\nDuring the 2016 United States presidential election, the organization falsely claimed to have shown that Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign accepted illegal donations from foreign sources.[44] Two Project Veritas members were sued for defamation by an employee of Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) who was wrongfully depicted as a \"willing participant in an underage sex-trafficking scheme\". The suit resulted in two settlements: O'Keefe issued a statement of regret and paid the ACORN employee $100,000 in 2013; the other Project Veritas member paid the employee an additional $50,000 in 2012.[50]\nIn 2017, Project Veritas was caught in a failed attempt to trick The Washington Post into posting a fabricated story about the sexual misconduct allegations against Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore.[16][17][51][52] Rather than uncritically publish a story that accused Moore of impregnating a teenager, the Post critically examined the story, checked the source, assessed her credibility, and found that her claims had no merit, and that instead Project Veritas was trying to dupe The Washington Post.[33]\nO'Keefe has been barred from fundraising for Project Veritas in Florida, Maine, Mississippi, Utah, and Wisconsin, partly because of his federal criminal record for entering a federal building under fraudulent pretenses and partly because Project Veritas has repeatedly failed to properly disclose his criminal convictions in applications for nonprofit status. Similar disclosure issues for the group's registration also exist in New Mexico, New York, and North Carolina.[53][54][55]\nOn February 11, 2021, Project Veritas's Twitter account was \"permanently suspended for repeated violations of Twitter's private information policy.\" At the same time, O'Keefe's personal account was temporarily locked for violating the policy pending the deletion of a tweet.[56][57] Twitter permanently suspended O'Keefe's personal account on April 15 for violating its policy on \"platform manipulation and spam\", which prohibits the use of fake accounts to \"artificially amplify or disrupt conversations\". O'Keefe denied that he used fake accounts on Twitter and said he intended to sue Twitter in response.[58][59]  In November 2022, following the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, Project Veritas's account was restored along with a number of other high-profile far-right accounts.[60]\nIn September 2021, Project Veritas's headquarters in Marmaroneck, New York, was destroyed by Hurricane Ida.[61][62] Later that month, the organization announced that it had been scammed out of $165,000 in what appeared to be a business email compromise attack. Attackers monitoring O'Keefe's email communications with his attorneys succeeded in interjecting an email from a similar-looking account into a conversation about an invoice payment, and the organization transferred funds to an account operated by the scammers.[63]\nO'Keefe was removed from his leadership position at Project Veritas on February 20, 2023, amid allegations of financial malfeasance and poor management of staff. The board charged that O'Keefe had used funds for a variety of personal expenses, including $14,000 for a charter flight related to fixing his boat and $150,000 for \"black cars\". The staff concerns were communicated to the board in a memo calling O'Keefe a \"power-drunk tyrant\".[40][43][64] According to an unreleased internal audit, O'Keefe also directed Project Veritas employees to book a $12,000 helicopter flight from New York to Southwest Harbor, spent $208,980 on black car travel and $2,500 on DJ equipment and was abusive towards Project Veritas employees. O'Keefe also allegedly spent donor money on a romantic relationship with Alexandra Rose, a California real estate agent and star of the Netflix reality series Selling the OC.[65]\nProject Veritas subsequently sued O'Keefe and two others, alleging that they had created a competing organization, O'Keefe Media Group, while still employees, approaching PV's donors and using company funds for this purpose. O'Keefe was also alleged to have improperly spent company funds on himself.[66][67]\nIn 2023, after six employees sued Project Veritas for underpayment, it settled for $270,000.[68] At the same time, Project Veritas settled a former employee's sexual harassment suit alleging a \"highly sexualized\" workplace with \"rampant\" drug use.[68]\nIn September 2023, Project Veritas suspended all operations after laying off most of its employees.[41]\nHannah Giles, who had been appointed CEO replacing O'Keefe in June, 2023, resigned in December that same year. Upon resigning she wrote \"I stepped into an unsalvageable mess \u2014 one wrought with strong evidence of past illegality and past financial improprieties.\" Further: \"Once such evidence was discovered, I brought the information to the appropriate law enforcement agencies.\"[69]\n\nMethods\nProject Veritas uses deceptive techniques, including recording people without their knowledge and misrepresenting their employees' identities and purposes. It hires former U.S. and British military and intelligence agents to train its employees, who are often called \"agents\" or \"operatives\" in internal documents. Internal memos show that Project Veritas clears these activities with its legal team to stay within the boundaries of the law, which The New York Times says is a sign of its interest in \"using tactics that test the boundaries of legality and are outside of mainstream reporting techniques\".[70][1] Rolling Stone called Project Veritas's reporting practices \"dubious\", with their reporters actively manipulating their targets.[71]\n\nNotable video recordings\nProject Veritas was founded in June 2010,[1] but O'Keefe produced two major deceptive videos before founding it:\n\nPlanned Parenthood recordings (2008)\nIn 2006, O'Keefe met Lila Rose, the founder of an anti-abortion group on the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus.[72] They secretly recorded encounters in Planned Parenthood clinics in Los Angeles and Santa Monica, in which Rose posed as a 15-year-old girl impregnated by a 23-year-old man. Rose and O'Keefe made two videos incorporating heavily edited[38] versions of the recordings and released them on YouTube.[73] The video omitted the parts of the conversation in which a Planned Parenthood employee asked Rose to consult her mother about the pregnancy and another employee told her, \"We have to follow the laws.\" Rose took down the videos after Planned Parenthood sent her a cease and desist letter in May 2007 asserting that the videos violated California's voice recording laws, which require consent from all recorded parties.[74][75]\n\nACORN videos (2009)\nMain article: ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy\nThe organization produced deceptively edited videos targeting the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), a 40-year-old advocacy organization for low- and moderate-income people.[76][77][78]\nIn September 2009, O'Keefe and his associate Hannah Giles published edited hidden-camera recordings in which Giles posed as a prostitute and O'Keefe as her boyfriend, a law student, in an attempt to elicit damaging responses from ACORN employees.[79] ACORN mostly registered people from Latino and African American communities.[80]\nThe videos were recorded during the summer of 2009[81] and appeared to show low-level ACORN employees in six cities advising Giles and O'Keefe on how to avoid detection by authorities of tax evasion, human smuggling and child prostitution.[82] He framed the undercover recordings with a preface of him dressed in a \"pimp\" outfit, which he also wore in TV media interviews. This gave viewers, including the media, the impression that he had dressed that way when speaking to ACORN workers, but he actually entered the ACORN offices in conservative street clothes (the sleeve of his dress shirt is visible on camera).[83] Furthermore, the ACORN employees involved reported his activities to the San Diego Police Department after he left.[2]:\u200a9\u200a O'Keefe selectively edited and manipulated his recordings of ACORN employees[84][85] and distorted the chronologies.[86] Several journalists and media outlets expressed regret for failing to properly scrutinize and vet his work.[citation needed]\n\nReception and lawsuit\nAfter the videos were released, Congress voted to freeze federal funding to ACORN.[87] The Census Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) terminated their contract relationships with ACORN.[88] By December 2009, an external investigation of ACORN was published that cleared it of any illegality, while commenting that its poor management practices contributed to unprofessional actions by some low-level employees.[89][90][91][92] In March 2010, ACORN announced it would dissolve due to loss of funding from government and especially private sources.[93] On March 1, 2010, Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes found that there was no criminal wrongdoing by the ACORN staff in New York.[94]\nThe California Attorney General's Office granted O'Keefe and Giles limited immunity from prosecution in exchange for providing the full, unedited videotapes related to ACORN offices in California.[79] On the basis of the edited video that O'Keefe released, ACORN employee Juan Carlos Vera appeared to be a willing participant in O'Keefe's plan to illegally smuggle young women into the U.S., but authorities confirmed that Vera immediately contacted them about O'Keefe and that he had also encouraged O'Keefe to share as much information as possible about his scheme and gather further evidence of O'Keefe's purported illegal activities, which could be used by prosecutors to bring charges against O'Keefe for attempted human trafficking. Due to O'Keefe's release of the dubiously edited video, intentionally designed to \"prove\" that ACORN employees were ready and willing to engage in illicit activities, Vera lost his job and was falsely portrayed as engaged in human trafficking.[47]\nO'Keefe moved for summary judgment in his favor, arguing that the plaintiff had no reasonable expectation that the conversation would be private. In August 2012, the federal judge hearing the case denied O'Keefe's motion. The judge ruled that O'Keefe had \"misled plaintiff to believe that the conversation would remain confidential by posing as a client seeking services from ACORN and asking whether their conversation was confidential.\"[95] On March 5, 2013, O'Keefe agreed to pay Vera $100,000 and acknowledged in the settlement that at the time he published his video he was unaware that Vera had notified the police about the incident. As part of the settlement, O'Keefe apologized for his actions, expressing regret for \"any pain suffered by Mr. Vera or his family.\"[96][46][97] Giles paid Vera $50,000 in a separate 2012 settlement.[45]\nOn June 14, 2010, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published its report finding no evidence that ACORN or any of its related organizations had mishandled any of the $40 million in federal money they had received in recent years.[98][99]\n\nNew Jersey Teachers' Union video (2010)\nStarting on October 25, 2010, O'Keefe posted a series of videos on the Internet titled Teachers Unions Gone Wild. At the time, the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA) was in negotiations with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie over teacher pay benefits and tenure.[100] O'Keefe obtained a video from recordings made by \"citizen journalists\" he recruited to attend the NJEA's leadership conference. They secretly recorded meetings and conversations with teacher participants.[100] It featured teachers discussing the difficulty of firing a tenured teacher.\nA second video featured a staged phone conversation by O'Keefe with Lawrence E. Everett, assistant superintendent of the Passaic, New Jersey city schools, in which Everett refused to commit to firing a teacher based on a parent's purported claim that the teacher had used the \"n-word\" with his child.[100][101] A third video (October 26, 2010) featured audio of a voice, identified as NJEA Associate Director Wayne Dibofsky, who alleged voter fraud during the 1997 Jersey City mayoral election.[100] The voice of Robert Byrne, Jersey City municipal clerk, was recorded on the same video; he noted that lawyers for both candidates monitored the election.[100]\nChristie said at the time that nothing on the videos surprised him.[102] NJEA spokesman Steve Wollmer said the union and its attorneys were discussing their options for legal action, but none was ever taken. Wollmer called the videos \"a calculated attack on this organization and its members\" and called O'Keefe \"flat-out sleazy\".[102]\n\nMedicaid videos (2011)\nIn the summer of 2011, O'Keefe released videos in which an actor working for Project Veritas attempted to apply for benefits while hinting that he was a drug smuggler; the actor failed to obtain benefits.[103] In Maine, Governor Paul LePage concluded upon further examination of the videos that there was no fraud or intent to commit fraud.[103][104][105]\nThe videos received less media attention than earlier O'Keefe efforts. Generally, the state officials and representatives acknowledged potential problems but also took a measured tone in response, to allow time to fully investigate and evaluate the incidents. After viewing the video, LePage thanked the person who took the video and noted: \"The video in its entirety does not show a person willfully helping someone defraud the welfare system. It does show a need for further job knowledge and continuous and improved staff training.\" He also said that \"we would be six months further along in fixing the problem\" if he had received the video when it was filmed. LePage directed his agency director to work on correcting the problem.[105]\nBen Johnson of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services noted that benefits were never granted in the case, and that the made-up story would have been caught if the application process had proceeded. He said his office would use the video to strengthen staff training. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine called the Ohio video \"outrageous\" and intended to instruct his state's Medicaid fraud unit to look into the incident.[106] The director of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, Michael Colbert, notified county leaders of a mandatory retraining \"to ensure they can identify people trying to defraud the government\".[107] A spokesman for Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell said he had asked state police to review the video and take appropriate action.[108][109]\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the director of that state's Department of Health and Human Services, Anthony Kreck, said the video filmed in his state \"raises concerns about how well trained and supported our staff are to handle outrageous situations\". He also expressed concern for the safety of the state employee with the figure [\"Sean Murphy\"] in the video \"who could be interpreted as intimidating\" and questioned why security wasn't called.[109]\n\nNPR video (2011)\nOn March 8, 2011, shortly before Congress was to vote on funding for National Public Radio (NPR), O'Keefe released a heavily edited video of a discussion with Ronald Schiller, NPR's senior vice president for fundraising, and associate Betsy Liley. The content was secretly recorded by O'Keefe's partners, Simon Templar (a pseudonym)[110] and Shaughn Adeleye, who pretended to be Muslims named Ibrahim Kasaam and Amir Malik.[111][112][32]\nIn the video, the NPR executives were shown meeting with Kasaam and Malik, who styled themselves as representatives of a self-described Muslim charity called the \"Muslim Education Action Center\" that wished to donate money to NPR. NPR responded that Schiller's remarks were presented out of sequence and that he said that he would speak personally, and not for NPR. Schiller said some highly placed Republicans believed the Republican Party had been hijacked by a radical group (the Tea Party) that they characterized as \"Islamophobic\" and \"seriously racist, racist people\", and while Schiller did not disagree, according to NPR, O'Keefe's editing made it appear those were Schiller's opinions. Schiller then says that unlike establishment Republicans, the growing Tea Party movement in the party \"is fanatically involved in people's personal lives and very fundamental Christian\u2014I wouldn't even call it Christian. It's this weird evangelical kind of move [sic].\"[113][114]\nLater in the edited video, Schiller seems to say he believes NPR \"would be better off in the long run without federal funding\", explaining that removal of federal funding would give NPR more independence and remove the widely held misconception that it is significantly funded by the public. But on the raw tape, Schiller also said that withdrawing federal funding would cause local stations to go under and that NPR is doing \"everything we can\" to keep it.[115]\nIn a statement released before analysis of the longer raw video, NPR said, \"The fraudulent organization represented in this video repeatedly pressed us to accept a $5 million check, with no strings attached, which we repeatedly refused to accept. We are appalled by the comments made by Ron Schiller in the video, which are contrary to what NPR stands for.\"[116]\nJournalists Ben Smith, James Poniewozik, and Dave Weigel have expressed regret for giving O'Keefe's NPR videos wider circulation without scrutinizing them further.[84]\n\nReception\nComparison of the raw video with the released one revealed editing characterized as \"selective\" and \"deceptive\" by Michael Gerson, opinion writer in The Washington Post, who wrote, \"O'Keefe did not merely leave a false impression; he manufactured an elaborate, alluring lie.\"[117] Time magazine wrote that the video \"transposed remarks from a different part of the meeting\", was \"manipulative\" and \"a partisan hit-job\".[32]\nThe raw video shows Schiller told the two men \"that donors cannot expect to influence news coverage\". On the longer tape, he says, \"There is such a big firewall between funding and reporting: Reporters will not be swayed in any way, shape or form.\"[84] The broadcast journalist Al Tompkins, who now teaches at the Poynter Institute, noted that Ron Schiller was a fundraiser, not an official affecting the newsroom. He commented on the raw tape: \"The message that he said most often\u2014I counted six times: He told these two people that he had never met before that you cannot buy coverage\", Tompkins said. \"He says it over and over and over again.[84]\nOn March 17, Martha T. Moore of USA Today reported: \"According to The Blaze analysis, Ron Schiller's most inflammatory remarks, that Tea Party members are 'seriously racist', were made as he was recounting the views of Republicans he has spoken with\u2014although he does not appear to disagree. It also shows Schiller appearing to laugh about the potential spread of Islamic sharia law, when the longer version shows he laughed in reaction to something completely different.\"[115]\nTwo days later, O'Keefe released a video in which Betsy Liley, senior director of institutional giving at NPR, appeared to have checked with senior management and said MEAC was cleared to make donations anonymously and NPR could help shield donations from government audits, but added that, in order to proceed, additional background information would be required, including an IRS Form 990.[118] Liley advised the caller that NPR executives would investigate them before accepting any large donation, examining tax records and checking out other organizations that have received donations from them.[118] Liley raises the possibility of NPR's turning down substantial gifts and stresses the \"firewall\" between the revenue-generating part of NPR and its news operation.[118] NPR put Liley on administrative leave. In emails released following the publication of the Liley video, NPR confirmed that the official had consulted appropriately with top management and notified the purported donors of problems with their desired method of donation.[119]\nThe video, which was released directly before a congressional vote on funding, caused immediate reaction from NPR critics in Congress. Schiller, who had already submitted his resignation in January so that he could join the Aspen Institute, moved up his resignation after the video release when NPR put him on administrative leave. NPR CEO Vivian Schiller (no relation to Ronald Schiller), who had not been implicated in the Project Veritas video, quickly resigned.[120][121][122][123][124][125] Vivian Schiller's resignation, mutually decided with the NPR board, was in part an attempt to show Congressional funders that NPR could hold itself accountable.[126]\n\nNew Hampshire primary video (2012)\nIn January 2012, O'Keefe released a video of associates obtaining a number of ballots for the New Hampshire primary by using the names of recently deceased voters. He said the video showed that \"the integrity of the elections process is severely comprised [sic].\"[127] His team culled names from published obituaries, which were checked against public voter roll information. O'Keefe said his team broke no laws, as they did not pretend to be the deceased persons when they asked for the ballots and did not cast votes after receiving ballots. One of his associates' attempts was caught by a voting supervisor at the polling station who recognized that the name he gave was of a deceased person; the associate in question left before police arrived.[128]\n\nReception\nSarah Parnass of ABC News reported that the video \"either exposes why voting laws are too lax or comes close to itself being voter fraud (or both)\".[127] One media account called it a stunt.[129] New Hampshire Governor John Lynch said, \"I think it is outrageous that we have out-of-staters coming into New Hampshire, coming into our polling places and misrepresenting themselves to the election officials, and I hope that they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, if in fact they're found guilty of some criminal act.\"[130] The New Hampshire Attorney General and the US Attorney's Office announced investigations into the video.[130]\nNew Hampshire Associate Attorney General Richard Head said he would investigate possible weaknesses in the voting system,[131] but noted the state did not have a history of known fraud related to people seeking ballots in the names of dead people.[127] Head announced he would investigate the possibility that the filmmakers committed crimes while producing the videos.[127]\nHamline University law professor David Schultz said, \"If they [O'Keefe's group] were intentionally going in and trying to fraudulently obtain a ballot, they violated the law\", referring to Title 42, which prohibits procuring ballots fraudulently.[129] The New Hampshire Attorney General's office dropped its investigation of O'Keefe for voter fraud in 2013.[132]\n\nPatrick Moran (2012)\nOn October 24, 2012, a video was released showing Patrick Moran, son of then-U.S. Representative Jim Moran, and a field director with his father's campaign, discussing a plan to cast fraudulent ballots, which was proposed to him by someone who posed as a fervent supporter of the campaign.[133] The person he was speaking with was a conservative activist with Project Veritas, and was secretly recording the conversation.[134] Patrick Moran resigned from the campaign, saying he did not want to be a distraction during the election, adding:[A]t no point have I, or will I ever endorse any sort of illegal or unethical behavior. At no point did I take this person seriously. He struck me as being unstable and joking, and for only that reason did I humor him. In hindsight, I should have immediately walked away, making it clear that there is no place in the electoral process for even the suggestion of illegal behavior, joking or not.[134]The Arlington County Police Department was made aware of the video and opened a criminal investigation into \"every component\" of the matter.[135]\nOn January 31, 2013, Arlington County announced that the investigation by its police department in collaboration with the Offices of the Virginia Attorney General and the Arlington County Commonwealth's Attorney had concluded and that no charges would be brought. The County stated: \"Patrick Moran and the Jim Moran for Congress campaign provided full cooperation throughout the investigation. Despite repeated attempts to involve the party responsible for producing the video, they failed to provide any assistance.\"[136]\n\nBattleground Texas (2014)\nIn 2014, Project Veritas released a video purporting to show illegalities in voter registration activities conducted by Battleground Texas.[137] A complaint against Battleground Texas was filed with the Secretary of State office, where the case was ultimately referred to two special prosecutors. The special prosecutors' report concluded there was \"no applicable criminal offense for the alleged act and insufficient evidence to suggest potential offenses\". The report also described the video as \"little more than a canard and political disinformation\". The case was dismissed.[138][139]\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Josh Fox (2014)\nIn 2014, at the Cannes Film Festival, Project Veritas released a deceptive video purporting to show that Josh Fox and other environmentalist documentary filmmakers could be influenced by foreign money. Fox is known for Gasland, a film that exposed problems with the use of fracking for U.S. gas and oil production. Pretending to represent Middle Eastern petroleum interests, Project Veritas operatives promised anonymous funding if Fox produced a documentary to their liking. Their professed interest was that opposing fracking would preserve U.S. reliance on Middle Eastern oil. Fox released his own recording of the phone call, which showed the Project Veritas video was a misrepresentation. Fox had repeatedly told the fake investors that he was not interested.[140][141][142]\n\nAmericans United for Change videos (2016)\nOn October 18, 2016, O'Keefe released a series of videos on Project Veritas's YouTube channel titled \"Rigging the Election\" apparently showing former national field director Scott Foval of Americans United for Change saying they should ensure they had people at the front of the rope lines at rallies in order to ask questions, a common practice known as \"bird dogging\".[143][144] The videos' accuracy was questioned for possibly omitting context, and the unedited raw footage has not been made available.[145][146][147][148] The GOP-appointed Attorney General of Wisconsin, Brad Schimel, investigated the claims made in the video twice, both times finding no evidence that Foval broke any voting laws.[149]\nDNC Chair Donna Brazile said, \"We do not believe, or have any evidence to suggest, that the activities articulated in the video actually occurred.\"[150][151] Americans United for Change fired Foval after the first video was released.[152] Foval later said he had been set up.[145][146][147] Robert Creamer, a DNC consultant and husband of U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky, said, \"We regret the unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations that were captured on hidden cameras of a regional contractor for our firm, and he is no longer working with us. While none of the schemes described in the conversations ever took place, these conversations do not at all reflect the values of Democracy Partners.\"[152] Shortly afterward, Creamer, who was also featured in the video, said he would end his consulting arrangement with the DNC to avoid becoming a distraction.[146]\nAfter his videos were published, O'Keefe filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) against Hillary Clinton's  presidential campaign and the DNC, alleging \"a criminal conspiracy\" involving the campaign, the DNC and three left-leaning super PACs.[153] On June 1, 2017, Creamer's firm, Democracy Partners, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Project Veritas, claiming it had lied to gain access to the firm and violated anti-wiretapping laws.[154] In September 2022, a jury found that Project Veritas had violated wiretapping laws and misrepresented itself to Democracy Partners, which the jury awarded $120,000. Project Veritas said it would appeal the decision.[155][35]\nIn response to a third video, in which O'Keefe said that Clinton was behind an illegal public relations gimmick to punish Trump for not releasing his tax returns, the Clinton campaign denied any wrongdoing. Independent campaign finance experts said the video did not support O'Keefe's claims. Clinton said she was aware of the activists dressed as Donald Duck, who were following Trump while asking about his tax returns, and said she was amused.[156]\nOn October 26, 2016, O'Keefe posted a fourth video on his Project Veritas Action YouTube channel. The video alleged that liberal groups supporting Hillary were illegally taking foreign money. The targeted group, Americans United for Change foundation, is a 501(c)4 organization and is allowed to accept foreign contributions, but it returned the money shortly after the video was released. The group's chief said, \"We returned the money because the last thing we want to be associated with is a character like O'Keefe who has been convicted and successfully sued for his illegal tactics and fraudulent activities.\"[157]\nOn January 9, 2017, Project Veritas operative Allison Maass was filmed attempting to bribe members of Americans Take Action into inciting a riot at Trump's inauguration.[158][159] On January 16, 2017, Project Veritas uploaded a video showing DC Antifascist Coalition members of Disrupt J20 plotting to use \"stink bombs\" at the DeploraBall. After the video's release, Disrupt J20 denied that, saying that the members deliberately gave false information to Veritas.[160] The video led to the arrest of one man allegedly involved in the plan,[161] as well as two associates. All three pleaded guilty.[162]\n\nNew York City elections official video (2016)\nIn October 2016, Project Veritas released a video taken at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party on December 16, 2015. It was secretly recorded by a Project Veritas associate posing as a political consultant. In the video, the Democratic representative from Manhattan on the New York City Board of Elections, Commissioner Alan Schulkin, agreed with several of the Veritas operatives' statements criticizing Mayor Bill de Blasio's municipal ID program.[163] Schulkin said, \"The law says you can't ask for anything. Which they really should be able to do. I believe they should be able to do it. They should ask for your ID. I think there is a lot of voter fraud\"; \"People don't realize\u2014certain neighborhoods in particular, they bus people around to vote\"; and \"They put them in a bus and go poll site to poll site.\"[164][163]\nShortly after the video's release, de Blasio called Schulkin's behavior \"entirely inappropriate\" and said that Schulkin should resign.[165] In a follow-up interview with the New York Post, Schulkin said, \"I should have said 'potential fraud' instead of 'fraud'\". Of the Project Veritas operative who secretly recorded him, Schulkin said, \"She was like a nuisance. I was just trying to placate her\", noting that in his haste to get away from her, he \"was agreeing with her when I shouldn't have been.\"[163][166] Schulkin was not reappointed after his term expired on December 31, 2016.[167]\n\nCNN undercover videos (2017)\nOn June 26, 2017, O'Keefe released a hidden-camera video on Project Veritas's YouTube channel that showed John Bonifield, a producer of health and medical stories for CNN, saying that CNN's coverage of the Russian investigation was for \"ratings\" and that the coverage was \"mostly bullshit\".[168] Bonifield had no involvement in CNN's political reporting; the video falsely implied that Bonifeld held a senior decision-making role at CNN.[168] When asked who Bonifield was speaking to or the video's source, Project Veritas declined to comment.[168] According to a CNN investigation, Veritas's operative gained access to Bonifield by falsely presenting themself as seeking a mentor for a career in journalism.[168] In a statement, CNN said: \"CNN stands by our medical producer John Bonifield. Diversity of personal opinion is what makes CNN strong, we welcome it and embrace it.\"[169][170] During a White House press briefing, deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders encouraged people to watch the video \"whether it's accurate or not\".[170]\nOn June 28, 2017, O'Keefe released the second part of the series of undercover videos, by then dubbed \"American Pravda\". In the video, CNN anchor Van Jones said, \"The Russia thing is just a big nothingburger.\"[171] When asked about the video in an email, CNN responded, \"lol\".[172] The same day, the videos were posted on Donald Trump's Instagram account.[173] Jones said that O'Keefe had deceptively edited the video to take his remarks out of context and was attempting to \"pull off a hoax\", adding that he believed that there probably was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.[171]\nOn June 30, 2017, O'Keefe released the third part of the undercover videos. Part 3 of the series showed CNN associate producer Jimmy Carr saying that Trump is \"fucking crazy\" and that \"on the inside, we all recognize he is a clown, that he is hilariously unqualified for this, he's really bad at this, and that he does not have America's best interests\". Carr also said: \"This is a man who's not actually a Republican; he just adopted that because that was the party he thought he could win in. He doesn't believe anything that these people believe.\"[174] He also called American voters \"stupid as shit\"[174] and called Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway an \"awful woman\" who \"looks like she got hit with a shovel\".[174] In a fourth video Project Veritas published on July 5, Carr criticized CNN co-anchor Chris Cuomo.[175]\n\nNew Jersey Education Association videos (2018)\nOn May 2, 2018, Project Veritas posted on YouTube two videos in which a Project Veritas employee, posing as the sister of a non-existent teacher, falsely stated that their fictional brother had pushed a student and expressed concern for their future; the union administrators they were speaking to reassured them.[176][177] In the second video, the administrator referenced a teacher who had been accused of fourth-degree criminal sexual contact with a 16-year-old student, stating that they had successfully defended them; in reality, the teacher had pled guilty.[178] The union attempted to force the administrator in question to resign, but an arbitrator blocked this decision, ruling it \"too harsh a penalty\" for their statements.[178]\n\nInternal Google documents (2019)\nIn 2019, a former software engineer, Zachary Vorhies, released internal Google documents to Project Veritas regarding the 2016 presidential election.[179] CNBC reviewed the documents and reported that \"the documents do not appear to contain any outright allegation of vote manipulation or attempts to bias the election.\" Google declined to comment on the material.[179]\nCNBC reported that among other things, the documents appeared to include lists related to how Google determines whether news sources are credible or whether they contain hate speech, which Project Veritas purported to indicate bias in search rankings.[179] In response to a tweet by Donald Trump, in which he claimed, without evidence, that Google manipulated 2.6 million votes favoring Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, a Google spokesperson reiterated a previous statement that Google has \"never re-ranked or altered search results to manipulate political sentiment.\"[179]\n\nABC not broadcasting Jeffrey Epstein accuser (2019)\nMain article: Amy Robach \u00a7\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein story\nIn 2019, Project Veritas accused ABC News of suppressing a 2015 interview with a key accuser of the alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Project Veritas obtained a recording of ABC news anchor Amy Robach in an unguarded moment lamenting that her interview had never been broadcast. Robach and an ABC official say the story lacked sufficient corroboration at that time.[180]\n\nMinnesota videos (2020)\nIn September 2020, Project Veritas and O'Keefe had repeatedly promoted the release of material supposedly showing evidence of voter fraud, with September 28 being the promoted release date. On September 27, Mike Lindell, honorary chairman of President Trump's re-election campaign in Minnesota, abruptly announced that the release date was changed to that very day, within hours of The New York Times publishing information on its investigation of the tax returns of Donald Trump. Researchers at Stanford University and the University of Washington concluded that the change in timing was likely connected to the Times story.[181]\nO'Keefe began releasing the material on Twitter on September 27, in video form. Within seven minutes, Donald Trump Jr., the son of the president, separately uploaded the video to Twitter, instead of re-sharing the video from O'Keefe's account. Two minutes later, an account for Trump's re-election campaign re-shared the video, while Trump himself soon began responding. Additionally, Trump Jr. uploaded the video to Facebook earlier than O'Keefe. These events present \"questions of coordination\" on whether the Trump campaign \"had access to the video before the general public\", stated the researchers from the two universities.[181] In addition, several well-known right-wing Twitter accounts both promoted the release of the material, and immediately shared the Twitter video upon release, leading to researchers concluding that this was \"a great example of what a coordinated disinformation campaign looks like\".[181]\nProject Veritas alleged that the material they released showed that Minnesota's Representative Ilhan Omar was connected to a cash-for-ballot harvesting scheme. Fact-checking website Snopes wrote that the videos \"lack evidence to support this accusation\", and that they included \"clips of conversations that raise questions about the original context and intent of the words spoken.\"[182] Snopes requested that Project Veritas release its raw, unedited footage, but Project Veritas refused. Snopes also could not verify the accuracy of the Somali to English translations done by Project Veritas.[182] USA Today offered a similar assessment in their fact-check, stating that the Project Veritas material provides \"no actual proof of fraud or any relationship between individuals in the video and Omar or her campaign\".[183] The New York Times wrote that the Project Veritas used only unidentified sources, and provided \"no verifiable evidence that Representative Ilhan Omar's campaign had collected ballots illegally\", writing that the story \"was probably part of a coordinated disinformation effort\".[181]\nThe main material featured by Project Veritas were two videos uploaded to YouTube. The videos feature only one person who was both identified and interviewed on-camera: Omar Jamal. He describes himself as \"part of the Ramsey County Sheriff's Office\". The Office stated that Omar Jamal was part of the community support group, instead of being involved in policing activities. Omar Jamal was not speaking on behalf of the Office when he alleged voter fraud, stated the Office. Omar Jamal also mentions his leadership of the Somali Watchdog Group. Its website was created in August 2020, which mentions no other members of the organization other than Omar Jamal.[182] The Daily Dot describes Omar Jamal as \"uncredentialed\" and \"questionable\", noting that he claimed to have studied at Tufts University Graduate School of International Affairs, but the school denied it. The Daily Dot also states that Omar Jamal is not the United Nations Permanent Representative to the Federal Republic of Somalia, as he has claimed.[184] Shortly after the release of the videos, Jamal started soliciting for public donations on GoFundMe, asking for a total of $500,000 for legal defense funds and for \"financial stability\".[185]\nProject Veritas named the first YouTube video: Ilhan Omar connected Ballot Harvester in cash-for-ballots scheme: 'Car is full' of absentee ballots. This video featured Snapchat clips of Liban Osman, a man from Minneapolis. Liban Osman never mentions Ilhan Omar, but does refer to his brother, Jamal Osman, a Minneapolis City Councilman. In different Snapchat clips, Mohamed separately makes reference to the topics of money and ballots, although he never says he received money to collect ballots. Ballot harvesting is legal in Minnesota, and there was no limit on collecting absentee ballots in Minnesota from late July 2020 to early September 2020.[182][186] FOX 9 received the full Snapchat clips from Liban Osman, who alleged that Project Veritas had edited and combined the videos to take them out of context. FOX 9 described the full clips as showing that Liban Osman was working for his brother, not Ilhan Omar. The full Snapchat clips also showed that when Liban Osman discussed money in politics, he was referring to his brother's competitors in Minneapolis' Ward 6 election, many of whom had little-funded campaigns.[186] Liban Osman told FOX 9 that he rejected a $10,000 bribe by Omar Jamal to say that Liban Osman was offering to pay people to vote for Ilhan Omar.[186]\nThe second YouTube video uploaded on this topic by Project Veritas was entitled Omar Connected Harvester SEEN Exchanging $200 for General Election Ballot. 'We don't care illegal.' However, Snopes states that it is \"unclear what's going on. All one sees in the video is two unidentified men speaking Somali in an outdoor setting, discussing filling out a voter registration form. At one point, money allegedly changes hands.\"[182] FOX 9 heard from two sources that the two men in the above incident are Omar Jamal and a relative of his, and that what Omar Jamal was doing was passing his relative $200 to transfer to the family of another relative, who was sick in Somalia.[186]\nAs a result of the videos, the Minneapolis Police is \"looking into the validity\" of the allegations.[182] Sahan Journal reported that Omar Jamal had later given an interview where he stated that he had not met any person who was paid to vote, which would contradict what he told Project Veritas.[183]\n\nPennsylvania postal worker video (2020)\nProject Veritas released a video where a Pennsylvania postal worker in Erie claimed, without evidence, that on November 5, the Erie postmaster told a postal supervisor \"that they messed up yesterday\", because \"they had postmarked one of the ballots the fourth instead of the third, because they were supposed to put them for the third\".[187][188]\nOn November 10, officials of the Postal Service Office of Inspector General told members of Congress that the postal worker had recanted the claims to investigators.[189] Shortly afterwards, multiple news reports reported that the postal worker, Richard Hopkins, told investigators from the U.S. Postal Service's Office of Inspector General that his allegations were not true and had signed an affidavit recanting his claims.[188][190][191] Hopkins initially denied that he had recanted his allegations; however, he had no comment when the final Postmaster's General report and audio recordings from his interview confirmed that he had done so.[188][192][189]\nAlso on November 11, Project Veritas released a two-hour audio recording purportedly of the conversation between Hopkins and the investigators. The Washington Post described it as \"not clear\" if Project Veritas had edited the audio recording before release. In the recording, Hopkins is heard saying that Project Veritas wrote his affidavit for him. Additionally, Hopkins recounted that when he was interacting with Project Veritas, he was in \"so much shock [he] wasn't paying that much attention to what they were telling me\". Hopkins says in the audio that he heard parts of a conversation, with the specific phrases he heard being \"ballots on the 4th\", \"all for the 3rd\", and \"one postmarked on the 4th\". Hopkins acknowledged in the audio that he had not heard the word \"backdate\".[193]\nThe Postal Service inspector general investigated and released a report in March 2021 confirming that Hopkins had recanted the account and finding no evidence to support his original claim.[189] Project Veritas continued to promote the postal worker's claims of fraud after they had been discredited.[189]\n\nTexas campaign worker (2020)\nOn January 13, 2021, Raquel Rodriguez, a former campaign worker was arrested and charged with election tampering, after Project Veritas posted an edited video of the woman, in which she appears to be helping an elderly person fill out a mail-in ballot form and discussing assisting people at the polls.[194][195] Rodriguez stated that she is the niece of the woman she is seen on video with, and has moved to have charges dismissed on the grounds that it is not unlawful to help relatives vote.[196]\n\nNew Hampshire double-voter (2020)\nProject Veritas released a hidden camera video alleging a voter in New Hampshire had voted twice (once under an assumed name) in 2016.[197] The person had been investigated by the New Hampshire State Police and referred to the state Attorney General in 2020, but the investigation languished unresolved until Project Veritas pursued the matter with the Attorney General's office. The man pled guilty to a felony of voting twice and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, which was suspended. He also pled guilty and was fined for a civil violation of applying for and receiving a ballot using a false name. The voter had been appointed an Inspector of Elections, someone who assists in the polling place during an election, although the appointment was rescinded following Project Veritas' reporting.[198][199][200]\n\nPBS lawyer video\nIn January 2021, a lawyer for PBS resigned after Project Veritas released a video of him.[201] PBS issued a statement which said, \"This employee no longer works for PBS. As a mid-level staff attorney, he did not speak on behalf of our organization, nor did he make any editorial decisions... There is no place for hateful rhetoric at PBS, and this individual\u2019s views in no way reflect our values or opinions... We strongly condemn violence and will continue to do what we have done for 50 years - use our national platform and local presence to strengthen communities and bring people together.\"[202][203]\n\nPfizer video (2023)\nIn January 2023, Project Veritas released an undercover video of a man identified as a Pfizer executive named Jordon Trishton Walker, who was supposedly a \"Director of Research and Development, Strategic Operations and mRNA Scientific Planning\" at the company. Walker claimed that Pfizer was considering experiments that involved \"mutating\" the SARS-CoV-2 virus to prepare vaccines ahead of time in a manner similar to gain-of-function research.[204][205][206] Walker also claimed that what Pfizer was allegedly doing was similar to what allegedly happened at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the lab leak theory of COVID-19's origin,[205][206] and appeared to reference debunked claims about the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on female fertility, saying that he \"hopes we don't find out that somehow this mRNA lingers in the body.\"[205]\nPfizer denied the allegations in the video, stating that it had not done any \"gain of function or directed evolution research\" during its development of its COVID-19 vaccine.[205][206] Multiple scientists told FactCheck.org that Walker appeared to be uninformed, and the experiments supposedly discussed at Pfizer made little sense for the company to conduct.[206] In another video released by Project Veritas on January 26, Walker admitted to not being a scientist by background, and said in a confrontation with the group, \"I was trying to impress a date. By lying. Why are you doing this to someone who's just working at a company to literally help the public?\"[206]\nFootage from the Project Veritas undercover video appeared in the 2023 anti-vaccine film Final Days.[207]\n\nNotable incidents\nSenator Mary Landrieu (2010)\nO'Keefe and colleagues were arrested in the Hale Boggs Federal Complex in New Orleans in January 2010 and charged with entering federal property under false pretenses with the intent of committing a felony, at the office of United States Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat. His three fellow activists, who were dressed as telephone repairmen when apprehended, included Robert Flanagan, the son of William Flanagan, acting U.S. Attorney of the Eastern District of Louisiana.[208][209] The four men were charged with malicious intent to damage the phone system.[210] O'Keefe stated that he had entered Landrieu's office to investigate complaints that she was ignoring phone calls from constituents during the debate over President Barack Obama's health care bill.[211]\nThe charges in the case were reduced from a felony to a single misdemeanor count of entering a federal building under false pretenses.[212][213] O'Keefe and the others pleaded guilty on May 26. O'Keefe was sentenced to three years' probation, 100 hours of community service and a $1,500 fine. The other three men received lesser sentences.[214]\nIn August 2013, O'Keefe revisited the incident by releasing a video entitled: \"a confrontation with former U.S. Attorney Jim Letten on the campus of Tulane University\". Letten is a former Republican U.S. Attorney who recused himself from the Landrieu incident because he knew the father of one of the men involved. The video shows Letten accusing O'Keefe of \"terrorizing\" Letten's wife at their home, of harassing him, and trespassing on the Tulane campus. He called O'Keefe a \"coward\" and a \"spud\", and referred to O'Keefe and his companions as \"hobbits\" and \"scum\".[215]\n\nAbbie Boudreau (2010)\nIn August 2010, O'Keefe planned a staged encounter with the CNN correspondent Abbie Boudreau, who was doing a documentary on the young conservative movement. He set up an appointment at his office in Maryland to discuss a video shoot.[216] Izzy Santa, executive director of Project Veritas, approached Boudreau when she arrived at the site. Santa warned Boudreau that O'Keefe was planning to meet with her on board a nearby boat, where he would try to seduce Boudreau. This would be filmed on hidden cameras.[216][217] Boudreau did not board the boat and soon left the area.[216][217]\nCNN later published a 13-page plan written by O'Keefe mentor Ben Wetmore. It listed props for the boat scheme, including pornography, sexual aids, condoms, a blindfold and \"fuzzy\" handcuffs.[216][217][218] When questioned by CNN, O'Keefe denied he was going to follow the Wetmore plan, as he found parts of it inappropriate.[217] Boudreau commented \"that does not appear to be true, according to a series of emails we obtained from Izzy Santa, who says the e-mails reveal James' true intentions.\"[219]\nFollowing the Boudreau incident, Project Veritas paid Izzy Santa a five-figure settlement after she threatened to sue, which included a nondisclosure agreement.[220]\n\nAttempt to solicit Colorado voter fraud (2014)\nIn October 2014, O'Keefe and his two colleagues attempted to bait staffers for Congressman Jared Polis (D-CO) and then-U.S. Senator Mark Udall (D-CO), as well as independent expenditure organizations, into approving voter fraud, according to several staffers who interacted with O'Keefe and his colleagues. Staffers began photographing O'Keefe's crew and advising them that what they were advocating was illegal; one nonprofit said they contacted police.[221]\nThe 2013 Colorado election modernization act had required that all registered voters receive mail-in ballots. PV released a video showing a few individuals appearing to be OK with illegal suggestions PV's people proffered, e.g. finding and voting discarded ballots. But no evidence of illegal activity was shown.[221][222][223]\n\nAttempted sting of Open Society Foundations (2016)\nOn March 16, 2016, O'Keefe attempted to call Open Society Foundations under the assumed name of Victor Kesh, describing himself as attached to \"a foundation\" seeking to \"get involved with you and aid what you do in fighting for European values\". O'Keefe forgot to hang up after recording the voicemail, and several more minutes of audio were recorded, revealing that he was attached to Discover the Networks and planning a series of attempts to create embarrassing videos or other recordings of targeted groups.[224][225]\n\nFailed attempt to sting The Washington Post (2017)\nBeginning in July 2017, Project Veritas operative Jaime Phillips attempted to infiltrate The Washington Post and other media outlets by joining networking groups related to journalism and left-leaning politics. She and a male companion attended events related to the Post, and their conversations with journalists were sometimes covertly recorded.[226]\nIn November 2017, The Washington Post reported that several women accused Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of pursuing them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.[227] Later that same month, Jaime Phillips approached The Washington Post and falsely claimed that Moore had impregnated her as a teenager and that she had an abortion.[227][228] In conducting its usual fact-checking, the Post discovered multiple red flags in her story. They found a GoFundMe page in her name that said, \"I've accepted a job to work in the conservative media movement to combat the lies and deceipt [sic] of the liberal MSM.\" After a Post reporter confronted her with the inconsistencies during a video-recorded interview, Phillips denied that she was working with an organization that targets journalists, and said that she no longer wanted to do the story.[227] She was seen outside Project Veritas' office in Mamaroneck, New York, with her car remaining at the office's parking lot for more than an hour.[227] O'Keefe declined to comment about the woman's apparent connection to Project Veritas.[227][228] Instead of running a story about Phillips' supposed pregnancy, the Post published an article about the attempted sting operation. The Post decided to disclose Phillips' original discussions made off the record, saying that Phillips' lies voided any agreement to keep those disclosures confidential.[227]\nHours after the Post published this story, O'Keefe released a video which he claimed exposed the newspaper's liberal bias.[229] The video includes undercover footage of conversations with two Post employees, national security reporter Dan Lamothe and product director Joey Marburger.[230] These employees explained to undercover Project Veritas operatives the difference between the news reporting of The Washington Post (which calls out the Trump administration's missteps while giving \"him credit where there's credit\" due) and the Post's opinion editorials; O'Keefe said that this exposed the Washington Post's \"hidden agenda\".[229][231]\nO'Keefe was criticized for his failed sting, and The Washington Post was praised. Rod Dreher of The American Conservative praised the Post and called on conservative donors to stop giving money to O'Keefe's outfit.[232] Dan McLaughlin of the conservative National Review said that O'Keefe's sting was an \"own goal\" and that O'Keefe was doing a disservice to the conservative movement;[233] Jim Geraghty of the National Review made a similar assessment.[234] Byron York of The Washington Examiner said that O'Keefe's \"idiocy\" was \"beyond boneheaded\",\u00a0and that \"O'Keefe really ought to hang it up.\"[235] Ben Shapiro, the conservative editor in chief of The Daily Wire, said that the botched sting was \"horrible, both morally and effectively\".[235] Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic wrote, \"If James O'Keefe respected the right-wing populists who make up the audience of Project Veritas ... he would tell them the truth about all of the organizations that he targets. Instead, Project Veritas operates in bad faith, an attribute it demonstrated again this week in the aftermath of its bungled attempt to trick The Washington Post.\"[236] Noah Rothman of the conservative magazine Commentary chastised O'Keefe for being exploitative of his audience: \"No longer are institutions like Veritas dedicated to combating ignorance in their audience. They're actively courting it.\"[237]\nJonathan Chait of New York magazine said that O'Keefe, having set out to prove that the Post was fake news, ended up disproving it. O'Keefe's plot collapsed because it was premised on a ludicrously false worldview, wrote Chait. \"The Washington Post does not, in fact, publish unverified accusations just because they're against Republicans.\" O'Keefe's attempts to prove rampant voter fraud have failed \"because voter fraud is not rampant\".[238]\nIn 2018, The Washington Post was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for its coverage of the allegations against Moore, including its expos\u00e9 of the unsuccessful Project Veritas sting.[7][34]\n\nAttempted stings of perceived enemies of President Trump\nThe New York Times reported in May 2021 that multiple operatives from Project Veritas were involved in a scheme to discredit FBI employees and other officials who they viewed to be enemies of President Trump. Living out of a large shared home in Georgetown, women employed by Project Veritas went on dates with FBI employees in an attempt to secretly record them denigrating Trump. National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster was a primary target of this operation, though efforts against him ended in March 2018 when McMaster resigned his position.[239]\n\nNurse Jodi O'Malley unproven claims on COVID-19 vaccines in a series of videos (2021)\nProject Veritas released a series of videos, starting on September 20, 2021, and finishing on October 6, 2021, with millions of views on YouTube,[240] showing nurse Jodi O'Malley, who works for the Indian Health Service in Arizona, speaking with a doctor identified as Maria Gonzales.[240][241] Gonzales can be heard saying: \"All this is bullshit. Now, [a patient] probably [has] myocarditis due to the vaccine. But now, they are not going to blame the vaccine, they are not reporting it. They want to shove it under the mat.\"[240]  Claims that the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) fails to register reports are misleading. VAERS, which currently contains over 720,000 reports, was designed for purposes of early warning and it may contain \"incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable\" information.[240] Despite minor challenges, data from VAERS still is helpful to health regulators such as the CDC and the FDA in their search for vaccine-related adverse effects.[242]\n\n\nFBI searches relating to theft of Ashley Biden diary\nThe New York Times reported in November 2021 that the FBI raided the homes of Project Veritas employees as part of a Justice Department investigation into the theft and publication of the diary of Ashley Biden, a daughter of President Joe Biden. Some pages were posted on a right-wing website on October 24, 2020. The FBI also raided O'Keefe's apartment. O'Keefe confirmed that the FBI searched the homes of current and former employees. In a video statement, O'Keefe said Project Veritas chose not to publish the diary because it could not be authenticated. O'Keefe also said Project Veritas returned the diary to law enforcement and attempted to return it to one of Biden's lawyers, who had \"refused to authenticate it\".[243][244]\nOn November 14, 2021, the American Civil Liberties Union published a statement in response to the raid:\n\nProject Veritas has engaged in disgraceful deceptions, and reasonable observers might not consider their activities to be journalism at all. Nevertheless, the precedent set in this case could have serious consequences for press freedom. Unless the government had good reason to believe that Project Veritas employees were directly involved in the criminal theft of the diary, it should not have subjected them to invasive searches and seizures. We urge the court to appoint a special master to ensure that law enforcement officers review only those materials that were lawfully seized and that are directly relevant to a legitimate criminal investigation.\u2014\u200aBrian Hauss, senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project[245]\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists, while clarifying that \"we do not endorse some of the tactics Project Veritas employs\", expressed concern that lacking \"a clear link between members of Project Veritas and allegations of criminal activities\" the FBI raids and seizure of evidence were a \"dangerous precedent that could allow law enforcement to search and confiscate reporters' unpublished source material in vague attempts to identify whistleblowers\".[246]\nIn December 2021, a federal judge appointed Barbara Jones to serve as a special master to ensure prosecutors could not access materials protected by attorney-client privilege and that the group's First Amendment rights as a media organization were protected.[247] Project Veritas issued a letter to the special master in March 2022, alleging that the Justice Department subverted First Amendment protections and secretly seized Veritas' internal emails.  Veritas further alleged that the Justice Department issued gag orders to Microsoft, the host of the emails, barring them from revealing the seizures to Veritas.[248][249]\nIn August 2022, Florida residents Aimee Harris and Robert Kurlander pleaded guilty in federal court to stealing the diary and other items belonging to Ashley Biden, and selling them to Project Veritas. The two agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department's investigation into how the diary was acquired by Project Veritas.[250]\n\nFunding and organization\nMuch of the funding for Project Veritas comes from anonymous donations through Donors Trust, a conservative, American nonprofit donor-advised fund backed by the Koch brothers, which according to its promotional materials, says that it will \"keep your charitable giving private, especially gifts funding sensitive or controversial issues\".[2][251][22] Donors Trust provided Project Veritas with gradually increasing cash infusions, including $25,000 in 2011, $922,500 in 2015,[36] $1.7 million in 2016,[20] and over $4 million in 2019.[37]\nOther prominent donors include the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which donated $20,000 in 2015,[36] including a $10,000 transfer in May 2015,[38][252] which was made a month before the launch of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.[38] O'Keefe attended, as a guest of the Trump campaign, the final presidential debate, and was later available in the spin room following the Las Vegas event.[256]\nThe group is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.[257][258] The group's political branch is Project Veritas Action (also known as the Project Veritas Action Fund), a 501(c)(4) organization.[42][259][260]\nThe Daily Dot reported that they found a pattern in which Project Veritas' supposed whistleblowers \"almost all establish crowdfunding pages hyped by Project Veritas within days and hours of going public with their allegations.\" The Daily Dot provided seven examples in 2019 or 2020: Richard Hopkins, Zach McElroy, Eric Cochran, Cary Poarch, Greg Copolla, Ryan Hartwig, and Omar Jamal, who each raised between $20,000 to over $115,000 on GoFundMe, although in some instances, the money was not disbursed.[261]\nIn January 2022, the British anti-disinformation organization Logically reported that Project Veritas relied on the Christian crowdfunding site GiveSendGo to raise money for its supposed whistleblowers.[262]\n\nJournalism and Project Veritas\nIn the aftermath of the 2022 FBI raid on O'Keefe, Project Veritas said they did journalism and could invoke First Amendment rights that protect members of news media. According to Columbia Journalism Review \"the Justice Manual, a departmental handbook, doesn't directly define who qualifies as news media, and thus receives those protections, instead favoring a case-by-case approach. To make its evaluation, the department employs a 'News Media Policy Consultation' form, which (as revealed by a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Timm and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University) lays out twelve factors for law enforcement agents to consider, including whether the individual possesses press credentials and whether they 'primarily [report] facts, as opposed to expressing opinion'. ... In the case of Veritas, according to filings, prosecutors determined that O'Keefe didn't meet its standards for news media.\"[263]\n\nNotes\n\n\n^ This phrase as it stands contains typos even though it is an exact quote from the book.

The university grants undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees. It also hosts the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe Mount Carmel campus, from atop Sleeping Giant (April 2009)\nWhat became Quinnipiac University was founded in 1929 by Samuel W. Tator,[9] a business professor and politician. Phillip Troup, a Yale College graduate, was another founder, and became its first president[9] until his death in 1939. Tator's wife, Irmagarde Tator, a Mount Holyoke College graduate, also played a major role in the fledgling institution's nurturing as its first bursar. Additional founders were E. Wight Bakke, who later became a professor of economics at Yale, and Robert R. Chamberlain, who headed a furniture company.[9]\nThe new institution was conceived in reaction to Northeastern University's abandonment of its New Haven, Connecticut, program at the onset of the Great Depression. Originally, it was located in New Haven and called the Connecticut College of Commerce. On opening its doors in 1929, it enrolled under 200, and its first graduating class comprised only eight students. At the time, it awarded only associate's degrees. In 1935, the college changed its name to the Junior College of Commerce.\nFrom 1943 to 1945, the college closed, as nearly its entire student body was drafted into World War II. Upon re-opening, the college's enrollment nearly quadrupled to approximately 800 students.\nIn 1951, the institution was renamed Quinnipiac College, in honor of the Quinnipiac Indian tribe that once inhabited Greater New Haven. That same year, Quinnipiac began to confer bachelor's degrees. In 1952, the school expanded its curriculum, relocated to a larger campus in New Haven, and also assumed administrative control of Larson College, a private women's college.\nIn 1966, Quinnipiac moved to its current campus in the Mount Carmel section of Hamden, Connecticut, at the foot of Sleeping Giant Park.[10] During the 1970s, Quinnipiac began to offer master's degrees.\n\nQuinnipiac's Arnold Bernhard Library and clock tower, focus of main campus quadrangle (August 2008)\nOn July 1, 2000, the college officially changed its name to \"Quinnipiac University\" to reflect its relatively new breadth in academic offerings.\n\nStudent journalism controversy[edit]\nThis section may be too long and excessively detailed. Please consider summarizing the material. (September 2023)\nThe university's official student newspaper is The Quinnipiac Chronicle.[11] In 2007 and 2008, Quinnipiac briefly drew national attention over the university's control over the Chronicle and other aspects of students' speech.\nIn the fall 2007 semester, junior Jason Braff, then-editor of the Chronicle, openly criticized a university policy that forbade the newspaper from publishing news online before the content was published in print. Braff wrote an editorial about the policy and also gave an interview to the local Waterbury paper, Republican-American, criticizing it. Manuel Carreiro, Quinnipiac's vice president and dean of students, sent Braff a letter, telling him that public disagreement with school policies would \"seriously place your position and organization at risk with the university.\" Braff received an $8,000 annual stipend for his position, and the university said that its employees have more of a responsibility than other students to uphold policies. However, Lynn Bushnell, QU's vice president for public affairs, denied threatening to fire Braff for disagreeing with school policies. Braff and the Chronicle staff were also openly critical of a public relations policy requiring all news media inquiries and questions (including those from the Chronicle) for administrators to be sent, via e-mail, to the university's public relations department.[12]\nQuinnipiac officials eventually decided that making the Chronicle independent from the university was the best idea. The school set forth a plan of action, which included the university appointing editors for the 2008\u20132009 academic year. Angry with this plan, Braff and other staff decided to leave the Chronicle at the end of the Spring 2008 semester; all applicants for editorial positions withdrew.\nFormer Chronicle staff members came back in Fall 2008 with Quad News, an independent newspaper with only a website and no print edition. Plans were to incorporate Quad News as its own business venture run on advertising revenue. Quad News immediately faced opposition from the university. Staff members learned in September that university officials had instructed all varsity coaches, staff and athletes not to speak to Quad News reporters. Shortly after, officials threatened to shut down the university's chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), claiming that they violated school policy by using their meetings as a cover for Quad News meetings. The Quad News staff had met at two SPJ meetings,[13] after the university took away the meeting reservation for Quad News, citing the fact that the organization was not a university-recognized club. Quad News stopped their meetings with SPJ.[14] The move prompted a public letter from national SPJ leaders, expressing concern over the university's actions. Both staffs recognized the other publication as legitimate.[15]\n\n2010 title IX discrimination case[edit]\nOn July 21, 2010, a federal judge ruled that Quinnipiac violated Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to provide equal treatment to women's athletic teams. The judge, Stefan Underhill, determined that Quinnipiac's decision to eliminate the women's volleyball team as well as its attempt to treat cheerleading as a competitive sport and its manipulation of reporting with regard to the numbers of male and female athletes amounted to unlawful discrimination against female students. Underhill ruled that competitive cheerleading was currently too underdeveloped and unorganized and then ordered that the school maintain its volleyball program for the 2010\u201311 season.[16][17]\n\n2015 ADA discrimination case[edit]\nIn 2015, the university reached a settlement with the federal government over allegations that the university violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by \"placing a student who had been diagnosed with depression on a mandatory medical leave of absence without first considering options for the student's continued enrollment.\" The university agreed to pay the former student over $32,000 to pay off her student loan and compensate her for \"emotional distress, pain and suffering\". The university also had agreed to implement a new policy of nondiscrimination against applicants or students on the basis of disability, examine changes that will allow students with mental health disabilities to participate in educational programs while seeking treatment for mental health conditions, and provide additional ADA training for all staff.[18]\n\nAcademics[edit]\nQuinnipiac offers 58 undergraduate majors and 22 graduate programs, including Juris Doctor and medical doctor programs. Its Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine admitted 60 students to its first class in 2013.[19] Quinnipiac University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[20]\nIn 2021, 72.5% of undergraduate applicants were accepted with matriculated students having an average GPA of 3.47. Quinnipiac is \"test optional\" for standardized tests for undergraduate applicants, but encourages submitting SAT or ACT scores, or both. For those submitting scores, the average SAT score was 1175 and average ACT score was 26. Test scores are required for Quinnipiac's Accelerated Dual-Degree Bachelor's/JD (3+3) and Dual-Degree BS/MHS in Physician Assistant (4+27 months) programs, or for those that have been homeschooled.[21][22]\nThe university operates several media outlets, including a professionally run commercial radio station, WATX, founded by journalist and Quinnipiac professor Lou Adler. The university also operates a student-run FM radio station WQAQ, which concurrently streams on the Internet. An award-winning[23] student-run television station, Q30 Television, is streamed online. Also, a student-produced newspaper, the Chronicle, established in 1929, publishes 2,500 copies every Wednesday. Students also run a literary magazine, the Montage, a yearbook, the Summit, the Quinnipiac Bobcats Sports Network (an online sports-focused broadcast), and the Quinnipiac Barnacle[24] (a parody news organization). Unaffiliated with the school, but run by students, is also an online newspaper, the Quad News.[25]\nQuinnipiac is home to one of the world's largest collections of art commemorating the Great Irish Famine. The collection is contained in Ireland\u2019s Great Hunger Museum (M\u00fasaem An Ghorta Mh\u00f3ir) just off the Mount Carmel Campus.[26]\nIn May 2014, Quinnipiac laid off 16 full-time but non-tenured faculty, with 11 of those from the College of Arts and Sciences, with no advance notice of the staff reduction.  The cuts followed several years of a \"stalled hiring\" and a faculty salary freeze.  The layoffs were mostly in departments that had experienced reduced enrollment in recent years, and enrollment was expected to be down by 12 percent in the fall 2014 term.[27]\n\nRankings[edit]\nAcademic rankingsNationalForbes[28]215THE / WSJ[29]261U.S. News & World Report[30]153Washington Monthly[31]283\nQuinnipiac is 153rd in the U.S. News & World Report 2020 rankings of national universities.[32]  For 2021, U.S. News & World Report ranked the physician assistant school 15th nationwide, the law school 122nd, the medical school 94\u2013122, and the business school 99\u2013131.[33]\nZippia name Quinnipiac University as the No. 1 college in the United States for getting a job in 2021, but Zippia did not report salaries.[34]\n\nCampuses[edit]\nQuinnipiac University consists of three campuses: the Mount Carmel campus off of Mount Carmel Avenue in Hamden; the York Hill campus off of Sherman Avenue in Hamden, and the North Haven Campus in North Haven, just north of New Haven, Connecticut.\nThe oldest of these campuses is the Mount Carmel Campus, at the foot of Sleeping Giant State Park. The Arnold Bernhard Library, Carl Hansen Student Center, university administration, and many of the student residences are found on this campus. The campus area is a census-designated place (CDP); it first appeared as a CDP in the 2020 Census with a population of 3,639.[35]\nThe York Hill Campus, located on a hill about a half-mile from the Mount Carmel Campus, began with the development of the M&T Bank Arena (formerly People\u2019s United Arena). In 2010 this was joined by a new student center as well as expanded parking and residence facilities as part of a $300 million expansion of the 250-acre (1.0\u00a0km2) campus.[36] York Hill is a \"green\" campus, making use of renewable energy and environmentally friendly resources, including one of the first major wind farms integrated into a university campus.[37]\nFor statistical reporting purposes, the Mount Carmel and York Hill campuses were listed together as the Quinnipiac University census-designated place prior to the 2020 census.[38]\nIn 2007, Quinnipiac acquired a 100-acre (0.40\u00a0km2) campus in North Haven, Connecticut, from Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, and has been gradually converting it for use by graduate programs at the university.[39]\n\nBuildings and landmarks[edit]\nCampus and Lender School of Business Center, with Sleeping Giant in background (April 2005)The current buildings on the Mount Carmel campus are:\nCarl Hansen Student Center \u2013 This facility serves as the home to the student government offices, WQAQ-FM radio station, the Chronicle and many student organizations. The student bookstore, main dining hall, campus post office facility, and a branch of M&T Bank  are located there as well. Renovated and expanded in 2012, it is home to a number of new meeting, multipurpose, and media rooms for use by fraternity and sorority life members as well as other student organizations.\nArnold Bernhard Library \u2013 The library is named for Arnold Bernhard, the founder and former chief executive officer of Value Line, Inc. Bernhard's son made the library renovation possible by donating $1 million for the project and an additional $3 million for the university's endowment in 1997. The donation was the largest in the university's history. The signature clock tower was replaced during the renovation which changed the icon of the school, which was a rocket ship spire, to a more conservative, modern tower.\nEd McMahon Mass Communications Center \u2013 Named for the television announcer and sidekick, who was a long-term financial supporter of the school,[40] the center is a media production facility equipped with up-to-date technology for hands-on training in all aspects of radio, television, journalism and multimedia production. The HDTV studio provides students with a professional environment for creating television programming.\nClarice L.

It conducts public opinion polls on politics and public policy as a public service as well as for academic research.[42]\nThe poll has been cited by major news outlets throughout North America and Europe, including The Washington Post,[43] Fox News,[44] USA Today,[45] The New York Times,[46] CNN,[47] and Reuters.[48]\nThe polling operation began informally in 1988 in conjunction with a marketing class.[42] It became formal in 1994 when the university hired a CBS News analyst to assess the data being gained.[42]  It subsequently focused on the Northeastern states, gradually expanding during presidential elections to cover swing states as well.[42]  The institute receives funding from the university,[42] with its phone callers generally being work study students or local residents.  The polls have been rated highly by FiveThirtyEight for accuracy in predicting primary and general elections.[49] In 2018 Politico called the Quinnipiac poll \"the most significant player among a number of schools that have established a national polling footprint.\"[50]\n\nStudent life[edit]\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n\n\nRace and ethnicity[51]\n\nTotal\n\n\nWhite\n\n74%\n\n74\u00a0\n\n\nHispanic\n\n10%\n\n10\u00a0\n\n\nBlack\n\n4%\n\n4\u00a0\n\n\nAsian\n\n4%\n\n4\u00a0\n\n\nForeign national\n\n3%\n\n3\u00a0\n\n\nOther[a]\n\n3%\n\n3\u00a0\n\n\nEconomic diversity\n\n\nLow-income[b]\n\n16%\n\n16\u00a0\n\n\nAffluent[c]\n\n84%\n\n84\u00a0\n\nQuinnipiac is home to seven fraternities and nine sororities.[52]\nThe National Panhellenic Conference is an umbrella organization which was created in 1902 for 26 women's sororities.\n\nAthletics[edit]\nMain article: Quinnipiac Bobcats\nThe Quinnipiac Bobcats, previously the Quinnipiac Braves, comprise the school's athletic teams. They play in NCAA Division I in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, except for the men's and women's ice hockey teams, which are part of ECAC Hockey, and the women's field hockey team, which joined Big East Conference starting with the 2016 season.[53]\n\nA baseball game between Quinnipiac and Army (March 2011)\nThere are seven men's varsity sports and 14 women's varsity sports,[54] with no football team.[54]\nThe team with the largest following on campus and in the area is the men's ice hockey team under established coach Rand Pecknold,[55] which has been nationally ranked at times; during the 2009\u20132010 season they entered the top ten of the national polls for the first time.[56] The team was the number-one nationally ranked hockey program for parts of the 2012\u20132013 season, reaching the Frozen Four for the first time in the program's history. They advanced to the national championship, ultimately falling to rival Yale. They also advanced to the 2016 Frozen Four, losing to North Dakota in the national championship game. In 2023, the Bobcats defeated Minnesota 3-2, 10 seconds into overtime, to capture the 2023 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship, the first NCAA National Championship for Quinnipiac in any sport.\nThe Quinnipiac women's ice hockey program had their most success in the 2009\u201310 NCAA Division I women's ice hockey season. Quinnipiac University added a women's golf and women's rugby team in the 2010\u201311 academic year.[54]\nIn the late 2000s the men's basketball team gained a greater following under new head coach Tom Moore, a disciple of UConn Huskies men's basketball coach Jim Calhoun.[55] Both men's and women's ice hockey and basketball teams play at the $52 million M&T Bank Arena, opened in 2007.[55] The women's lacrosse team has also been quite strong. Men's cross country captured 4 NEC titles in 5 years between 2004 and 2008. The athletics program has been under pressures common to other universities, and at the close of the 2008\u20132009 academic year, men's golf, men's outdoor track, men's indoor track and women's volleyball were dropped as a cost-cutting measure, although the last of these was restored (as a result of a Title IX suit[57]).\n\nNotable alumni[edit]\nSam Anas \u2013 ice hockey player\nMatthew Batten \u2013 baseball player\nBryce Van Brabant \u2013 ice hockey player\nReid Cashman \u2013 ice hockey coach\nRyan Cleckner \u2013 former Army sniper and veteran activist\nConnor Clifton \u2013 ice hockey player\nEvan Conti \u2013 basketball player and college basketball coach\nJohn Delaney \u2013 baseball coach\nWilliam D.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served three terms representing Illinois in the United States House of Representatives from 2003 to 2009, then was White House Chief of Staff from 2009 to 2010 under Barack Obama, and served as mayor of Chicago from 2011 to 2019.\nBorn in Chicago, Emanuel is a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College and Northwestern University. Early in his career, Emanuel served as director of the finance committee for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. In 1993, he joined the Clinton administration, where he served as assistant to the president for political affairs and as Senior Advisor to the President for policy and strategy. Emanuel worked at the investment bank Wasserstein Perella & Co. from 1998 for two-and-a-half years, and served on the board of directors of Freddie Mac. In 2002, he ran for the seat in the U.S. House of Representatives vacated by Rod Blagojevich, who resigned to become governor of Illinois. Emanuel won the first of three terms representing Illinois's 5th congressional district, a seat he held from 2003 to 2009. As chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, he oversaw Democratic wins in the 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, allowing the party to gain control of the chamber for the first time since 1994.\nAfter the 2008 U.S. presidential election, President Barack Obama appointed Emanuel to serve as White House chief of staff. In October 2010, Emanuel resigned as chief of staff to run in the 2011 Chicago mayoral election. Emanuel won with 55% of the vote over five other candidates in the non-partisan mayoral election. In the 2015 Chicago mayoral election, he failed to obtain an absolute majority in the first round but defeated Cook County board commissioner Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda in the subsequent run-off election. In late 2015, Emanuel's approval rating plunged to \"the low 20s\",[2] in response to a series of scandals.[3]\nIn October 2017, Emanuel announced he planned to run for a third term,[4] but he reversed his decision on September 4, 2018.[5] The Chicago Tribune assessed Emanuel's performance as mayor as \"mixed\", and at one point half of Chicagoans favored Emanuel's resignation. He left office in May 2019 and was succeeded by Lori Lightfoot. In August 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Emanuel to be the United States Ambassador to Japan;[6] he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in December of that year.[7]\n\n\nEarly life and family[edit]\nEmanuel's father, Benjamin M. Emanuel, was born in Jerusalem and immigrated to the United States, where he worked as a pediatrician at Michael Reese Hospital[8] He was once a member of the Irgun, a Jewish paramilitary organization that operated in Mandatory Palestine.[9]\nThe surname Emanuel (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc), which means \"God is with us\", was adopted by their family in honor of Rahm's uncle (his father's brother) Emanuel Auerbach, who was killed in 1933 in an altercation with Arabs in Jerusalem.[10][11]\nEmanuel's maternal grandfather was a Moldovan Jew who emigrated from Bessarabia.[12] His mother, Marsha (n\u00e9e Smulevitz), is the daughter of a West Side Chicago labor union organizer who worked in the civil rights movement. She briefly owned a local rock and roll club,[10][13] and later became an adherent of Benjamin Spock's writings.\nEmanuel's parents met during the 1950s in Chicago.[13] Emanuel was born on November 29, 1959, in Chicago, Illinois. His first name, Rahm (\u05e8\u05dd\u200e) means high or lofty in Hebrew.[11] He attended Bernard Zell Anshe Emet Day School in Lakeview for elementary school. He has been described by his older brother Ezekiel, an oncologist and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, as \"quiet and observant\" as a child.[8] Ari, his younger brother, is the CEO of Endeavor, an entertainment agency with headquarters in Beverly Hills, California.[14] Rahm Emanuel also has a younger adopted sister, Shoshana.[10]\n\nEducation and ballet dance[edit]\nWhile he lived in Chicago, Emanuel attended the Bernard Zell Anshe Emet Day School. After his family moved to Wilmette, north of the city, Emanuel attended public schools: Romona School, Locust Junior High School, and New Trier High School.[13][15] He and his brothers attended summer camp in Israel, including the summer following the June 1967 Six-Day War.[10][16] Ezekiel has written that their father \"did not believe in falsely building his sons' self-esteem by purposefully letting us win, or tolerating sloppy play\". About Rahm, he also wrote:\n\nThough fiercely intelligent ... he was not naturally inclined to sit at a desk and put in extra effort to turn a B into an A. As my father often said, without noting that the phrase applied to himself at that same age, \"Rahm always tries to get the maximum for the minimum.\"[8]\nRahm was encouraged by his mother to take ballet lessons, and is a graduate of the Evanston School of Ballet,[17] as well as a student of The Joel Hall Dance Center, where his children later took lessons.[18] He won a scholarship to the Joffrey Ballet,[19] but turned it down to attend Sarah Lawrence College, a liberal arts school with a strong dance program.[20] This background, as well as the Ambassador\u2019s short stature, led some critics to nickname him \"tiny dancer\". While an undergraduate, Emanuel was elected to the Sarah Lawrence Student Senate. He graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts, and went on to receive a Master of Arts in Speech and Communication from Northwestern University in 1985.[21]\nEmanuel took part in a two-week civilian volunteer holiday, known as the Sar-El, where, as a civilian volunteer, he assisted the Israel Defense Forces during the 1991 Gulf War, helping to repair truck brakes in one of Israel's northern bases.[22][23]\nWhile a high school student working part-time at an Arby's restaurant, Emanuel severely cut his right middle finger on a meat slicer, which was later infected from swimming in Lake Michigan. His finger was partially amputated due to the severity of the infection.[8][24]\n\nPolitical staffer career[edit]\nEmanuel began his political career with the public interest and consumer rights organization Illinois Public Action.[25] He went on to serve in a number of capacities in local and national politics, initially specializing in fund-raising for Illinois campaigns, and then nationally.[26]\nEmanuel worked for Democrat Paul Simon's 1984 election to the U.S. Senate.[27] He also worked as the national campaign director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 1988, and was senior advisor and chief fund-raiser for Richard M. Daley's successful initial campaign for mayor of Chicago, in 1989.[25]\nAt the start of then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton's presidential primary campaign, Emanuel was appointed to direct the campaign's finance committee.[26] Emanuel insisted that Clinton schedule time for fund-raising and delay campaigning in New Hampshire.[28] Clinton embarked on an aggressive national fund-raising campaign that allowed the campaign to keep buying television time as attacks on Clinton's character threatened to swamp the campaign during the New Hampshire primary. Clinton's primary rival, Paul Tsongas (the New Hampshire Democratic primary winner), later withdrew, citing a lack of campaign funds.[29] Richard Mintz, a Washington public relations consultant who worked with Emanuel on the campaign, spoke about the soundness of the idea: \"It was that [extra] million dollars that really allowed the campaign to withstand the storm we had to ride out in New Hampshire [over Clinton's relationship with Gennifer Flowers and the controversy over his draft status during the Vietnam War].\" Emanuel's knowledge of the top donors in the country, and his rapport with \"heavily Jewish\" donors helped Clinton amass a then-unheard-of sum of $72 million.[30] While working on the Clinton campaign Emanuel was a paid retainer of the investment bank Goldman Sachs.[31]\n\nClinton administration[edit]\nFollowing the campaign, Emanuel served as a senior advisor to Clinton at the White House from 1993 to 1998.[32] In the White House, Emanuel was initially Assistant to the President for Political Affairs[33] and then Senior Advisor to the President for Policy and Strategy.[34] He was a leading strategist in White House efforts to institute NAFTA,[35][36] among other Clinton initiatives.[37]\nEmanuel is known for his \"take-no-prisoners style\" that has earned him the nickname \"Rahmbo\".[38] Emanuel sent a dead fish in a box to a pollster who was late delivering polling results.[39] On the night after the 1992 election, angry at Democrats and Republicans who \"betrayed\" them in the 1992 election, Emanuel stood up at a celebratory dinner with colleagues from the campaign and began plunging a steak knife into the table and began rattling off names while shouting \"Dead! Dead! Dead!\".[10] Before Tony Blair gave a pro-Clinton speech during the impeachment crisis, Emanuel reportedly screamed at Blair \"Don't fuck this up!\" while Clinton was present.[40] Blair and Clinton both burst into laughter.[41] However, by 2007 friends of Emanuel were saying that he has \"mellowed out\".[30] Stories of his personal style have entered the popular culture, inspiring articles and websites that chronicle these and other quotes and incidents.[42][43][44][45] The character Josh Lyman in The West Wing was said to be based on Emanuel, though executive producer Lawrence O'Donnell denied this.[46]\n\nCareer in finance[edit]\nAfter serving as an advisor to Bill Clinton, in 1998 Emanuel resigned from his position in the administration and joined the investment banking firm Wasserstein Perella, where he worked for 2+1\u20442 years.[47] Although he did not have an MBA degree or prior banking experience, he became a managing director at the firm's Chicago office in 1999, and according to congressional disclosures, made $16.2 million in his 2+1\u20442 years as a banker.[47][48] At Wasserstein Perella, he worked on eight deals, including the acquisition by Commonwealth Edison of Peco Energy and the purchase by GTCR Golder Rauner of the SecurityLink home security unit from SBC Communications.[47]\n\nFreddie Mac[edit]\nIn 2000, Emanuel was named to the Board of Directors of Freddie Mac by President Clinton. He earned at least $320,000 during his time there, including later stock sales.[49] During Emanuel's time on the board, Freddie Mac was plagued with scandals involving campaign contributions and accounting irregularities.[49][50] The Bush administration rejected a request under the Freedom of Information Act to review Freddie Mac board minutes and correspondence during Emanuel's time as a director.[49] The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight later accused the board of having \"failed in its duty to follow up on matters brought to its attention\". Emanuel resigned from the board in 2001 before his first bid for Congress.[51]\n\nCongressional career[edit]\nRep. John Dingell and Rep. Emanuel celebrate Paczki Day, February 28, 2006\nElections[edit]\nIn 2002, Emanuel pursued the U.S. House seat in the 5th district of Illinois, previously held by Rod Blagojevich, who successfully ran for governor of Illinois. His strongest opponent in the crowded primary of eight was former Illinois state representative Nancy Kaszak. During the primary, Edward Moskal, president of the Polish American Congress, a political action committee endorsing Kaszak, called Emanuel a \"millionaire carpetbagger\".[52] Emanuel won the primary and defeated Republican candidate Mark Augusti in the general election. Emanuel's inaugural election to the House with 67% was the closest he ever had for this seat, as he subsequently won more than 70% in all of his re-election bids.\n\nTenure[edit]\nRep. Emanuel speaking at St. Hyacinth Basilica in Chicago's Polish Village\nEmanuel was elected after the October 2002 joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, and so did not vote on it. However, in the lead up to the resolution, Emanuel spoke out in support of the war.[citation needed]\nIn January 2003, Emanuel was named to the House Financial Services Committee and sat on the subcommittee that oversaw Freddie Mac. A few months later, Freddie Mac Chief Executive Officer Leland Brendsel was forced out and the committee and subcommittee commenced more than a year of hearings into Freddie Mac. Emanuel skipped every hearing allegedly for reasons of avoiding any appearance of favoritism, impropriety, or conflict of interest.[53]\nEmanuel aligned himself with the Democratic Leadership Council.[54]\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman[edit]\nEmanuel assumed the position of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman (DCCC) after the death of the previous chair, Bob Matsui. Emanuel led the Democratic Party's effort to capture the majority in the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections. The documentary HouseQuake, featuring Emanuel, chronicles those elections.[55] Emanuel had disagreements over Democratic election strategy with Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean. Dean favored a \"fifty-state strategy\", building support for the Democratic Party over the long term, while Emanuel advocated a more tactical approach focusing attention on key districts.[56]\n\nEmanuel speaks during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado\nThe Democratic Party gained 30 seats in the House in the 2006 elections, and Emanuel received considerable praise for his stewardship of the DCCC, even from Illinois Republican Rep. Ray LaHood, who said, \"He legitimately can be called the golden boy of the Democratic Party today. He recruited the right candidates, found the money, and funded them, and provided issues for them. Rahm did what no one else could do in seven cycles.\"[57]\nHowever, Emanuel also faced some criticism for his failure to support some progressive candidates, as Howard Dean advocated.[58] Emanuel had \"aggressively recruited right-leaning candidates, frequently military veterans, including former Republicans\". Many of the Representatives that Rahm had recruited, such as Heath Shuler, ended up \"[voting] against important Obama administration priorities, like economic stimulus, banking reform, and health care\". Howie Klein has suggested that Emanuel's congressional campaign strategy was short-sighted, as it \"contributed to the massive G.O.P. majorities we have now, the biggest since the nineteen-twenties\" when the Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 mid-term elections.[3]\nAfter Emanuel's election as chairman of the Democratic Caucus (see below), Chris Van Hollen became committee chair for the 110th Congress.\n\nDemocratic Caucus chairman[edit]\nAfter his role in helping the Democrats win the 2006 elections, Emanuel was believed to be a leading candidate for the position of Majority Whip. Nancy Pelosi, who became the next Speaker of the House of Representatives, persuaded him not to challenge Jim Clyburn, but instead to succeed Clyburn in the role of Democratic Caucus Chairman. In return, Pelosi agreed to assign the caucus chair more responsibilities, including \"aspects of strategy and messaging, incumbent retention, policy development, and rapid-response communications\". Caucus vice-chair John Larson remained in his role instead of running for the chairman position.[59]\nAfter Vice President Dick Cheney asserted that he did not fall within the bounds of orders set for the executive branch, Emanuel called for cutting off the $4.8 million the Executive Branch provides for the Vice President's office.[60]\n\nPositions on political issues[edit]\nEmanuel joins Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich to advocate changes to Medicare legislation, September 24, 2003\nSocial issues\nEmanuel is generally liberal on social issues. He has maintained a 100-percent pro-choice voting record, supports LGBT rights including same-sex marriage, and is a strong supporter of gun control, rated \"F\" by the NRA in December 2003.[61] He has also strongly supported the banning of numerous rifles based upon \"sporting purposes\" criteria.[62]\nDuring his original 2002 campaign, Emanuel spoke in support of the goal of \"to help make health care affordable and available for all Americans\".[30]\nIn his 2006 book, co-authored with Bruce Reed, The Plan: Big Ideas for America,[63] Emanuel advocated a three-month compulsory universal service program for Americans between the ages of 18 and 25. A similar, expanded version of the initiative was later proposed by Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nIraq war\nDuring his original 2002 campaign, Emanuel \"indicated his support of President Bush's position on Iraq, but said he believed the President needed to better articulate his position to the American people\".[30]\nIn the 2006 congressional primaries, Emanuel, then head of the Democratic congressional campaign committee, helped organize a run by Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran with no political experience, against grassroots candidate Christine Cegelis in Illinois' 6th district. Expedited withdrawal from Iraq was a central point of Cegelis' campaign and Duckworth opposed a withdrawal timetable.[64]\n\nMiddle East\nIn June 2007, Emanuel condemned an outbreak of Palestinian violence in the Gaza Strip and criticized Arab countries for not applying the same kind of pressure on the Palestinians as they have on Israel. At a 2003 pro-Israel rally in Chicago, Emanuel told the marchers that Israel was \"ready for peace\" but would not get there until Palestinians \"turn away from the path of terror\".[65]\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff[edit]\nEmanuel declared in April 2006 that he would support Hillary Clinton should she pursue the presidency in 2008. Emanuel remained close to Clinton since leaving the White House, talking strategy with her at least once a month as chairman of the DCCC.[15] However, Emanuel's loyalties came into conflict when his home-state Senator, Barack Obama, expressed interest in the race. Asked in January 2007, about his stance on the Democratic presidential nomination, he said: \"I'm hiding under the desk. I'm very far under the desk, and I'm bringing my paper and my phone.\"[66] Emanuel remained neutral in the race until June 4, 2008, the day after the final primary contests, when he endorsed Obama.[67]\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Emanuel reads a newspaper in the Oval Office, as President Barack Obama talks on the phone on April 4, 2009\nEmanuel with Barack Obama in the Oval Office\nOn November 6, 2008, Emanuel accepted the position of White House Chief of Staff for US President Barack Obama.[68][69] He resigned his congressional seat effective January 2, 2009.[70] A special primary to fill his vacated congressional seat was held on March 3, 2009, and the special general election on April 7.[71] John Fritchey, a candidate for that seat, said at a forum that Emanuel had told him he may be interested in running for the seat again in the future.[72]\nSome Republican leaders criticized Emanuel's appointment because they believed it went against Obama's campaign promises of less divisive politics, given Emanuel's reputation as a partisan Democrat.[69] Republican Senator Lindsey Graham disagreed, saying: \"This is a wise choice by President-elect Obama. He's tough, but fair, honest, direct, and candid.\"[73] Ira Forman, executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, said that the choice indicated that Obama would not listen to the \"wrong people\" regarding the U.S.\u2013Israel relationship.[65] Some commentators opined that Emanuel would be good for the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process because if Israeli leaders made excuses for not dismantling settlements, Emanuel would be tough and pressure the Israelis to comply.[74][75] Some Palestinians expressed dismay at Emanuel's appointment.[76][77]\nWeeks after accepting the appointment, Emanuel participated on a panel of corporate chief executive officers sponsored by the Wall Street Journal, and said, \"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\"[78] Emanuel explained later, \"... what I said was, never allow a good crisis to go to waste when it's an opportunity to do things that you had never considered, or that you didn't think were possible.\"[79]\nIn a 2009 article in The New York Times, Emanuel was characterized as being \"perhaps the most influential chief of staff of a generation\".[80]\nHe has a reputation for his no-holds-barred negotiation style that involves \"his share of shouting and cursing\". Ezekiel Emanuel has written, \"The impatient, pushy Emanuel style is so well known that during a recent job interview I was asked, point-blank, whether I had the level-headed temperament the position required. ... . [A]s obvious as our flaws are to others, it's difficult to recognize them in ourselves.\"[8] At a January 2010 closed-door meeting in the White House with liberal activists, Emanuel called them \"fucking retarded\" for planning to run TV ads attacking conservative Democrats who didn't support Obama's health-care overhaul. After the remarks were quoted in a front-page story of the Wall Street Journal,[81] and after he was criticized by Sarah Palin, Emanuel apologized to organizations for mentally disabled people for using the word \"retarded\".[82][83]\nAccording to Jonathan Alter's book, The Promise, Emanuel opposed Barack Obama's plan for a broad health care reform, but Obama overrode him. Emanuel advocated a smaller plan because it could get bi-partisan support. Emanuel wanted to expand coverage for children, and increase the number of single mothers eligible for Medicaid. For that reason, it was dubbed \"the Titanic plan\", a reference to the priority given to saving women and children during the sinking of the Titanic.[84] Reportedly, House Speaker Pelosi had to convince Obama on the health care initiative after Emanuel dramatically scaled it back. Emanuel has since apologized for his role, saying, \"Thank God for the country, he didn't listen to me\", after the Supreme Court upheld \"ObamaCare\" in 2012.[3]\nAs chief of staff, Emanuel would make his staff laugh. During a staff meeting, when Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra gave uniformly upbeat reports, Emanuel is said to have looked at him and said: \"Whatever you're taking, I want some.\"[85] Emanuel had a hand in war strategy, political maneuvering, communications and economic policy. Bob Woodward wrote in Obama's Wars that Emanuel made a habit of telephoning CIA Director Leon Panetta and asking about the lethal drone strikes aimed at Al Qaeda, asking, \"Who did we get today?\".[86]\nIn 2010, Emanuel was reported to have conflicts with other senior members of the president's team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also the focal point of criticism from left-leaning Democrats for the administration's perceived move to the center. By September 2010, with the Democrats anticipating heavy losses in mid-term elections, this was said to precipitate Emanuel's departure as chief of staff.[87]\n\nMayor of Chicago[edit]\nElections[edit]\n2011[edit]\n\n\n\nWikinews has related news:\n White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel steps down to run for Mayor of Chicago\n\nSee also: 2011 Chicago mayoral election\nOn September 30, 2010, it was announced that Emanuel would leave his post as White House Chief of Staff to run for Mayor of Chicago.[88] He was replaced by Pete Rouse on October 2, 2010.\nEmanuel entered the race with high-name recognition, having not only a sizeable local profile, but also a sizable national profile.[89]\nEmanuel's eligibility for office was challenged on the basis of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election. This was the period when Emanuel was in Washington serving as the White House chief of staff. The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a candidate is different from residency for purposes of being a voter.[90] A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's eligibility.[91][92]\nIn the race, Emanuel had a financial advantage over the other candidates.[89] He was by far the best-financed candidate, with more than three times the campaign funds as the second-best financed candidate (Gery Chico), and more than twenty-times the third-best financed candidate (Carol Moseley Braun).[89] Emanuel's had his financial advantage from the very start of his candidacy, as he began his campaign with approximately $1.2 million from his congressional campaign fund.[89] By December 31, 2010, he had raised more than $10.5 million in additional funds.[89] On January 1, 2011, the Illinois Campaign Disclosure Act took effect, limiting individual personal contributions to candidates to $5,000.[89] Nevertheless, he continued to raise substantial funds, ultimately having procured a total $15 million over the course of his campaign (including those funds transferred from his congressional campaign committee).[89] Emanuel was able to raise so much because he had experience fundraising, had built a Washington connections and a national profile, and his brother Ari had Hollywood connections.[89] He had 75 contributors give more than $50,000, twenty-five of which were from out of state.[89] Among these high-dollar contributors were Steven Spielberg, Donald Trump, and Steve Jobs.[89] Despite having a national fundraising operation, three-quarters of his donations came locally.[89] More than $800,000 of his contributions were from financial exchange and trading executives, with his largest single donation being a $200,000 donation from executives of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.[89]\nEmanuel proposed lowering the city's sales tax and raising the service tax.[89] Emanuel supported negotiating with the Chicago Teachers Union for longer school days and school years.[89] Emanuel opposed instituting an elected school board.[89]  This received criticism from other candidates.[89]\nOther candidates assailed his tenure at Freddie Mac.[89]\nAs the frontrunner, Emanuel had gotten more press coverage than other mayoral candidates. This was furthered by the fact that the challenge to his residency became a dominant headline.[89]\nEmanuel entered the race with solid backing from North and Northwest Side Democratic Ward Committeemen.[89]\nEmanuel's advertisements showed portrayed him as having strong roots in the city, and, in telling his biography, emphasized his upbringing on the North Shore.[89] Contrarily, Emanuel's opponents attempted to characterize him as a carpetbagger, hailing not from the city itself but rather from the North Shore and Washington, D.C.[89] Emanuel's advertisements also sought to emphasize his tenures in working in the White House and his tenure as a congressman.[89] Emanuel would highlight his relations with presidents Clinton and Obama.[89] He also sought to highlight the fact that he had forged connections in Washington during his time in congress, and also had strong business ties.[89]\nEmanuel had overwhelming support from Jewish and LGBT voters.[89] Emanuel held a lead with independent progressives, including strong support from the lakefront liberals voting bloc of wealthy white progressives from the city's northern lakefront.[89] As the only white candidate in the race, Emanuel was seen as likely to receive unified support from a majority of the white electorate.[89] Since the Hispanic vote was largely split between two Hispanic candidates (Gery Chico and Miguel del Valle), once Emanuel was able to secure the support of the majority of the black vote, he had secured himself victory.[89]\nIn attracting African American voters to his candidacy, Emanuel was helped by his associations with Presidents Clinton and Obama, both of whom were extremely popular among the African American community.[89] After Moseley Braun's support began to crater following a character attack on fellow candidate Patricia Van Pelt Watkins which backfired, Emanuel was the beneficiary as the, largely African American, voters that abandoned their support of Moseley Braun's candidacy primarily migrated to support his candidacy.[89] Once this happened, Emanuel had all but secured himself a first-place finish, and the remaining candidates were left to jockey for second-place in hopes of there being a runoff.[89]\nEmanuel carried the endorsements of both the city's major daily newspapers, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times.[89]\nEmanuel's mayoral campaign was the inspiration for a satirical Twitter account called MayorEmanuel, which received more than 43,000 followers, more popular than Emanuel's actual Twitter account. Emanuel announced on February 28 that if the author would reveal himself, he would donate $5,000 to the charity of the author's choice.[93] When Chicago journalist Dan Sinker revealed himself, Emanuel donated the money to Young Chicago Authors, a community organization which helps young people with writing and publishing skills.[94]\n\nEmanuel (left) at the 2012 Hyde Park Obama presidential reelection campaign office\nEmanuel was elected on February 22, 2011, with 55% of the vote,[95] and was sworn in as the 55th Mayor of Chicago on May 16, 2011, at the Pritzker Pavilion. At his inauguration were outgoing Mayor Richard M. Daley, Vice President Joe Biden, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, former Mayor Jane Byrne, and William M. Daley, brother of the outgoing mayor and who would later serve as White House Chief of Staff.[96][97] Emanuel was Chicago's first Jewish mayor.[98]\n\n2015[edit]\nSee also: 2015 Chicago mayoral election\nIn August 2014, Chicago Tribune poll reported Emanuel had a 35% approval rating as mayor of Chicago.[99][100]\nIn 2015, Emanuel won 56 percent of the vote in the run-off election against Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda held on April 7, 2015.[101] He had been hurt by sharp neighborhood criticism of his decision to shut down 50 public schools in black and Latino neighborhoods, and his installation of red light cameras, together with anger at the high level of gun violence on the streets. On the other hand, he was supported by the business community and most elements of the Democratic party.[102]\n\n2016[edit]\nIn February 2016, Chicago Tribune polls reported that Emanuel approval ratings had dropped to 27%, for his role as the Mayor of Chicago.[103]\nThe Chicago Tribune stated that this all-time record low job approval confirms a \"public crisis in confidence\" for Emanuel who had been subjected to weeks of public protests, allegations of him covering up the Laquan McDonald police shooting video, as well as federal civil rights investigation of his police department.[104] For several months, Emanuel claimed that making the video public would jeopardize a federal investigation into the shooting and had refused to allow the video to be shown to the public, despite the Justice Department had not raised any issues with the public release of the footage. It wasn't until a judge forced its release that it was later seen that the contents in the video contradicted the police's narrative of what had really occurred. A public backlash resulted from Emanuel's handling of the video, with a \"steady barrage\" of \"Resign Rahm\" protests since November\".[105]\nAccording to Chicago Tribunal polls, the majority didn't believe Emanuel to be honest nor trustworthy, and 83 percent of polled Chicagoans didn't believe Emanuel's statements on the video, and 68 percent felt that he was not justified in withholding the video from the public.[103][106] In response to the public backlash, Emanuel forced the resignation of Chicago's police chief, Garry McCarthy, as well as generating a plan that promised to reform the city's police department.[107]\n\n2019[edit]\nSee also: 2019 Chicago mayoral election\nEmanuel announced in October 2017 that he was running for reelection in 2019, despite low approval ratings and some potentially serious challengers.[4] In September 2018, Emanuel then announced he would not run for reelection as previously announced. Close friend David Axelrod told USA Today that Emanuel had grown uncertain about his devotion to a third term.[108] Emanuel had been leading in the polls prior to his decision to withdraw. However according to Politico citing data from Public Policy Polling, Rahm Emanuel had a lead over most of his potential challengers but it was \"not enough to win the contest outright\" and that in a head-to-head matchup with Paul Vallas, Vallas actually had a polling lead over Emanuel with 39 percent to 33.[108][109][110][111] In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Emanuel stated that he had been conferring with his wife and children for months before announcing the decision and that he felt it was time to \"write the next chapter.\"[5]\n\nTenure[edit]\nEmanuel assembled a transition team from varied backgrounds.[112][113] On November 16, the city council voted unanimously to adopt the mayor's first budget, which decreased the budget by $34 million and increased spending by $46.2 million, supported by increasing fees and fines. Despite most Aldermen opposing cuts to library workers and the closure of mental health clinics, they ultimately supported it, calling it \"honest\".[114][115] At a news conference in November 2012, Emanuel listed his top three priorities for the state legislature as security and pension reform, adding a casino to Chicago, and equal marriage rights for same-sex couples.[116] At a press conference with then Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, who previously vetoed legislation to put a casino in Chicago, the two were \"very close\" to reaching a deal.[117]\nIn April 2018, Emanuel received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from NUI Galway, a university in Chicago's sister city of Galway, Ireland, with the conferrers citing achievements in education reform while Mayor.[118][119]\nDuring Emanuel's time as mayor of Chicago, two of Emanuel's appointees, Barbara Byrd-Bennett and Amer Ahmad, were convicted of corruption charges.[120] A third appointee, Forrest Claypool, resigned after the inspector general accused him of a cover up. Emanuel received backlash for defending him against the accusations.[120]\n\nRahm Emanuel speaking at the ground-breaking ceremony of the Bloomingdale Trail in August 2013\nAldermanic appointments[edit]\nAs mayor, Emanuel appointed several individuals to fill vacancies on the Chicago City Council. This included appointing Natashia Holmes as 7th Ward alderman in 2013,[121] Deb Mell as 33rd Ward alderman in 2013,[122] Sophia King as 4th ward alderman in 2016, and Silvana Tabares as 23rd Ward alderman in 2018.[123]\nFollowing the resignation of Willie Cochran in March 2019, Emanuel had the opportunity to make a final aldermanic appointment, appointing an interim alderman to hold the seat until his successor (to be elected in an April 2 runoff) would assume office on May 20.[124] However, Emanuel did not make such an appointment, leaving the seat vacant until March 20.\n\nPolice and community relations[edit]\nIn August 2012, a federal lawsuit was filed by eleven Chicago police officers alleging they were removed from the mayoral security detail and replaced with officers who worked on Emanuel's mayoral campaign, in violation of the 1983 Shakman Decree, which bars city officials from making political considerations in the hiring process.[125]\nRahm Emanuel faced a great deal of criticism for his handling of the October 20, 2014, police murder of Laquan McDonald. The dash-cam video of the shooting was initially withheld, and only was released after a judge ordered it on November 24, 2015. After the video release, Emanuel was condemned for covering up the incident and allowing Chicago police to use excessive force against minorities.[126] Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass wrote that the Emanuel administration withheld from the public the police dashboard camera video of the shooting in order to secure the reelection.[127] Emanuel responded to criticism of the shooting and how it was handled by firing police Superintendent Garry McCarthy.[128] In early December, the federal Justice Department announced an investigation into the Chicago Police Department, a move which Emanuel initially called \"misguided\".[129] Illinois state legislator La Shawn Ford also introduced a bill to recall the mayor (an effort most pundits claim was more symbolic than practical).[130]\nProtests erupted soon after the release of the video, and on Black Friday protesters shut down part of the city's Magnificent Mile.[131][132] Public calls for resignation grew steadily over this period, including a well-circulated op-ed published in The New York Times.[133] By early December, Emanuel's approval rating had sunk to 18%, with 67% of Chicagoans disapproving of his job performance, and slightly more than half of those polled calling for his resignation.[134] During the week of December 10, protestors blocked streets and continued to call for Emanuel to resign.[135][136] Additional protests against Emanuel and Chicago's Police Department were held on the city's busy Michigan Avenue shopping area on December 24, 2015.[137]\nOn December 26, 2015, a police officer killed two people in another shooting, including a woman whom the officer had shot by mistake. On December 28, Emanuel announced that he was cutting short his vacation in Cuba to deal with the crisis.[138][139][140] Emanuel announced several changes to the Chicago police department on December 30, including doubling the number of Tasers issued to officers.[141] On New Year's Eve, the Emanuel administration released e-mails revealing they had sought to coordinate with independent agencies such as the Independent Police Review Authority regarding public relations after the shooting.[142][143][144] The same day The New Yorker added to the wave of negative media attention surrounding the mayor by publishing \"The Sudden But Well-Deserved Fall of Rahm Emanuel\", an article critically reevaluating Emanuel's legacy as a political operative since the early 1990s.[3]\n\nPublic education[edit]\nIn 2012, during the contract negotiations between the city and the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), compromise could not be reached over issues like health insurance increases, teacher evaluations, and seniority pay increases.[145] On August 8, 2012, the CTU voted 90% to authorize a strike.[146] On September 10, the CTU began a strike[147] after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding.[148] On September 14, the CTU reached a tentative agreement with the city which included preferences for teachers who have been laid off due to a school closing to be hired in another school and student test scores having less of a role in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned.[149] This tentative agreement did not hold, and the strike continued, after which Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work.[150] On September 17, Emanuel's efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week.[151] Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012,[152][153] and students began their return to the schools the following day.[154]\nOn September 17, 2013, Emanuel's appointed Chicago Board of Education announced the closing of 50 Chicago public schools, 49 elementary schools and a high school \u2014 the largest school closure in Chicago history.[155]\nThe trends in dropout and graduation rates have shown considerable improvement in the last five years, but researchers point out the alternative school performance does not follow the general trend.[156][157]\n\nPublic health[edit]\nOn August 16, 2011, Emanuel unveiled \"Healthy Chicago\", the city's first  public health blueprint with Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Bechara Choucair.[158] Emanuel initiated the consolidation of City Council committees from 19 to 16 in a cost control effort.[159] On October 30, 2012, Emanuel voiced his support for the demolition of the abandoned Prentice Women's Hospital Building, in order for Northwestern University, which owns the property, to build a new facility. Preservationists supported historical landmark status.[160] Days later, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks voted that the building met landmark status criteria then reversed their decision later in the same meeting. On November 15, a judge granted a temporary stay of the decision in order for a lawsuit filed by preservation coalitions against the landmark commission to be heard.[161]\n\nLack of transparency[edit]\nEmanuel rejected requests under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act from The Chicago Tribune for various communication and information logs for himself and his staff, labelling it \"unduly burdensome\". After a second request by the Tribune, they were informed that 90 percent of the e-mails had been deleted by Emanuel and his top aides.[162] As a result, Emanuel came under fire for going against his campaign promise to create \"the most open, accountable, and transparent government that the City of Chicago has ever seen\".[163]\nEmanuel and his office were found guilty of breaking state law by withholding government emails by transferring them onto his personal phone.[120]\nIn March 2017 Chicago Tribune reported Emanuel released 2,696 emails he had previously withheld. In the emails there were found to be 26 possible violations of lobbying laws. On at least 26 occasions lobbyists, corporate executives, donors, and friends of Emanuel got access to Emanuel or other city officials without registering as a lobbyist or reporting their contact to the ethics board.[164]\n\nTax-exempt status of Lollapalooza[edit]\nLollapalooza, an annual summer music festival in Grant Park, was exempt from taxation. Emanuel's brother Ari is the co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor, which co-owns the event. In 2011 Rahm Emanuel asked the City Council to appoint an independent third party negotiator, to avoid having the negotiation seen as biased. Although the deal was reached before Emanuel took office, tax breaks must be negotiated every year.[165] It was later revealed that the festival received its tax exemption for 2011 in the final days of the Daley administration.[166] In 2012, Lollapalooza paid taxes for the first time in seven years and extended its contract to host in Grant Park through 2021.[167]\n\nHyperloop[edit]\nRahm Emanuel announced preliminary plans to award Elon Musk a contract to build a Hyperloop between downtown Chicago and the city's O'Hare International Airport, although it would receive no public subsidies under this plan. However, some criticized the fact that Elon Musk has in the past donated more than $55,000 to Rahm Emanuel's various election campaigns, suggesting a potential conflict of interest between the two.[168]\n\nImmigration[edit]\nChicago became a \"de jure\" sanctuary city in 2012 when Rahm Emanuel and the City Council passed the Welcoming City Ordinance.[169][170]\n\nApproval ratings[edit]\nGraphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Reports were that he intended to model the transition between their administrations upon the U.S. presidential transition between the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Emanuel had been part of that transition as Obama's Chief of Staff designate.[178]\n\nPost-mayoral career[edit]\nEmanuel (left) with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in 2022\nEmanuel with Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in 2022\nEmanuel and his wife with President Joe Biden in May 2022\nEmanuel riding a Tokyo Metro train in January 2023\nHours after Emanuel left office, the magazine  The Atlantic, where he had written a dozen essays in prior months, made him a contributing editor;[179] however, this honorary title was withdrawn after black staff members objected.[180] In May 2019, he was named founding executive chair of the National BAM Advisory Council of the Becoming A Man youth program.[181] In June 2019, Emanuel joined Centerview Partners as a senior counselor.[182] Since July 2019, Emanuel has also served as a political analyst for ABC News.[183][184][185]\n\nPotential Cabinet position in Biden administration[edit]\nProgressive politicians nationally, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Matt Martin, opposed his potential inclusion in Joe Biden's Cabinet, citing his handling of the murder of Laquan McDonald.[186][187][188] Initially, Emanuel was considered for Transportation secretary in the Biden administration.[189][190]\n\nUnited States Ambassador to Japan[edit]\nIt was reported in February 2021 that Emanuel was being considered by the Biden administration as an ambassador to either China or Japan.[191] In April 2021 it was reported that Biden had chosen him as ambassador to Japan;[192] Emanuel was formally nominated to serve as ambassador in August 2021.[193][194] Hearings were held on Emanuel's nomination in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on October 20, 2021. The committee favorably reported Emanuel's nomination to the Senate floor on November 3, 2021. On December 18, 2021, United States Senate confirmed Emanuel's nomination in a 48\u201321 vote; senators Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley and Elizabeth Warren were the only Democrats to vote against his confirmation.[195][196] He presented his credentials to Japanese Emperor Naruhito on March 25, 2022.[197]\nEmanuel gained popularity with the Japanese public, in part by using the local rail transport system to get around Tokyo and across the country, frequently posting photographs of himself using the rail systems on Twitter.[198] However, he drew criticism from some Japanese politicians with his public statements on gay and transgender rights, released while Japanese lawmakers debated an anti-discrimination bill. Masamune Wada, a Liberal Democratic member of the House of Councillors responded, saying Emanuel should keep out of domestic politics or risk expulsion.[199]\n\nAnti-Semitic vandalism[edit]\nEmanuel's Michigan residence was vandalized with the word \"Nazis\" spray-painted on its fence. According to the Chicago Sun Times, Emanuel was not present at the residence during the incident. In the aftermath, Emanuel stated, \"Our family is very proud of how our friends, neighbors, and the community have rallied to our support and in a singular voice in condemning hatred and bigotry.\"[200][201]\nEmanuel also praised local law enforcement for their swift response to the vandalism. This event occurred in the aftermath of the Israel-Hamas war.[200][201]\n\nElectoral history[edit]\nMayor of Chicago\n\nChicago mayoral election, 2015: Run-off[202]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nRahm Emanuel (Incumbent) \n\n319,543 \n\n55.7 \n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nJes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda\n\n253,981\n\n44.3\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n573,524 \n\n100 \n\n\n\nChicago mayoral election, 2015: Primary[203]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nRahm Emanuel (Incumbent) \n\n218,217 \n\n45.63 \n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nJes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda \n\n160,414 \n\n33.55 \n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nWillie Wilson\n\n50,960\n\n10.66\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nRobert Fioretti\n\n35,363\n\n7.39\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nWilliam \"Dock\" Wallis III\n\n13,250\n\n2.77\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n478,204 \n\n100 \n\n\n\nChicago Mayoral Election, 2011[204] (General Election)\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nRahm Emanuel \n\n323,546 \n\n55.25 \n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nGery Chico\n\n140,362\n\n23.97\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nMiguel del Valle\n\n54,342\n\n9.28\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nCarol Moseley Braun\n\n52,483\n\n8.96\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nPatricia Van Pelt Watkins\n\n9,604\n\n1.64\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\nWilliam \"Dock\" Walls III\n\n5,291\n\n0.90\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n585,628 \n\n100 \n\n\nUS House of Representatives\n\n\nU.S. House, 5th District of Illinois (General Election)\n\n\nYear\n\nWinning candidate\n\nParty\n\nPct\n\nOpponent\n\nParty\n\nPct\n\nOpponent\n\nParty\n\nPct\n\n\n2002\n\nRahm Emanuel\n\nDemocratic\n\n67%\n\nMark Augusti\n\nRepublican\n\n29%\n\nFrank Gonzalez\n\nLibertarian\n\n4%\n\n\n2004\n\nRahm Emanuel (inc.)\n\nDemocratic\n\n76%\n\nBruce Best\n\nRepublican\n\n24%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\nRahm Emanuel (inc.)\n\nDemocratic\n\n78%\n\nKevin White\n\nRepublican\n\n22%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\nRahm Emanuel (inc.)\n\nDemocratic\n\n74%\n\nTom Hanson\n\nRepublican\n\n22%\n\nAlan Augustson\n\nGreen\n\n4%\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nEmanuel and his wife, Amy Rule, in 2022\nEmanuel and his wife, Amy Merritt Rule, have a son and two daughters. As of 2011, their family lived in the Ravenswood neighborhood on Chicago's north side.[205] Rule converted to Judaism shortly before their wedding.[206] Emanuel is a close friend of fellow Chicagoan David Axelrod, chief strategist for Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaign, and Axelrod signed the ketuba, the Jewish marriage contract, at Emanuel's wedding.[39] The Emanuels are members of the Chicago synagogue Anshe Sholom B'nai Israel.[30] Rabbi Asher Lopatin of the congregation described Emanuel's family as \"a very involved Jewish family\", adding that \"Amy was one of the teachers for a class for children during the High Holidays two years ago\".[30] Emanuel has said of his Judaism: \"I am proud of my heritage and treasure the values it has taught me.\"[30] Emanuel's children attended the private University of Chicago Laboratory Schools in the Hyde Park neighborhood on Chicago's south side.[207]\nEach year during the winter holidays, Emanuel takes a family trip on which his children can be exposed to other cultures and parts of the world. Prior family trips have been to Vietnam, India, Kenya, Zambia, and South America. His 2015 holiday trip was scheduled for the island of Cuba.[208]\nEmanuel trains for and participates in triathlons.[15] In 2011, he scored 9th out of 80 competitors in his age group.

He is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute since 2012.[1] He is the editor of National Review magazine, a contributing columnist for The Washington Post,[2] and a contributing editor to the domestic policy journal National Affairs.[3]\nPonnuru has written on a wide array of political and policy topics, appeared on numerous public affairs and news interview programs, reflecting his widely respected voice on conservative policy.[4] In 2015, Politico Magazine listed both him and his wife, April Ponnuru, as two of the top \"Politico 50\" influential leaders in American politics. This was the first and only time that a husband and wife appeared on the list at the same time.[4]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nPonnuru was raised in Prairie Village, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri, where he attended Briarwood Elementary School and Mission Valley Middle School. After graduating from Shawnee Mission East High School, at the age of 16, he attended Princeton University, where he earned a B.A. in history and graduated summa cum laude in 1995. He completed a 107-page long senior thesis, titled \"Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America, in Brief\", under the supervision of Robert P. George.[5] Raised by a Hindu father and a Lutheran mother,[6] Ponnuru is of Indian descent. Later in life, Ponnuru, once an agnostic, converted to Catholicism.[7] He is married to April Ponnuru.[8]\n\nCareer[edit]\nJournalism[edit]\nSince 1999, Ponnuru has been either a senior fellow or senior editor, or both at the same time, at National Review, where he has frequently written and commented on such diverse topics as politics, public policy, economics, the law, and even his religious faith.[9] In its pages, he has called for a revival of Republican policy thinking by applying conservative ideals to contemporary problems and emphasizing the concerns of the middle class.\nPonnuru has long been one of the nation's leading conservative voices in making the case for increasing the child tax credit to properly compensate parents for the cost of raising children, and won praise for finding common ground with progressives and Democrats on the issue.[1][10] He has also been a regular co-author and leading voice with economist David Beckworth on the topic of monetary policy and market monetarism.[11][12]\nPonnuru has frequently appeared on a diverse array of television programs about public affairs, among them Meet the Press,[13] Face the Nation, C-Span, the PBS NewsHour, National Public Radio's All Things Considered, ABC News' This Week with George Stephanopoulos, ABC News. The Daily Show, and The Colbert Report.[14]\nHe has also been a regular guest speaker on policy, politics, and constitutionalism at several of the nation's leading college campuses,[15][16] In 2013, he was a fellow at the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics. The Institute's website has described \"the Fellows\" as \"a dynamic and distinguished group of political practitioners and journalists who will lead seminars and interact with UChicago students and faculty.\"[17]\nIn 2006, Ponnuru wrote The Party of Death: The Democrats, the Media, the Courts, and the Disregard for Human Life.[18]\nThe volume is Ponnuru's unique and argumentive exposition on such right-to-life issues as abortion and euthanasia, concentrating on the circumstances of the United States Democratic Party's shift from anti-abortion to abortion rights. Peggy Noonan celebrated the book as \"the most significant statement of the need to protect human life in America since Ronald Reagan's Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation\".[citation needed]\nNational Review Online Editor at Large Jonah Goldberg, wrote of the book: \"Ponnuru scrupulously sticks to nonreligious arguments, accessible to everyone. But that hasn't stopped critics from charging that his motives are unacceptably 'religious,' while others have complained Ponnuru is too coldly rational. Again it seems Ponnuru's real sin isn't how he says things, but that he says them at all.\"[19]\nJohn Derbyshire wrote in The New English Review: \"RTL is made as presentable as possible in Party of Death, with writing that is engaging and lucid.... (Right to Lifers) are welcoming Party of Death very joyfully, though, and they are right to do so, as it is an exceptionally fine piece of polemical writing in support of their... cause.... Party of Death is obviously inspired by religious belief. The philosophical passages strictly follow the Golden Rule of religious apologetics, which is: The conclusion is known in advance, and the task of the intellectual is to erect supporting arguments.\"[20]\nIn a sharp, but measured response to accusations that Ponnuru had an overtly religious viewpoint in approaching the abortion issue, he forcefully addressed the issue himself head-on: \"I have made a show of reasoning, but my conclusions have all rather conveniently lined up with the teachings of my church... For the record, my views on abortion have not changed since I was an agnostic... It is true that I am a Catholic. It is also true that I believe that my church's teaching on abortion is reasonable, sound, and correct. It is because I came to believe that Catholicism is true, after all, that I became a Catholic. If I didn't believe Catholic teachings were true, I wouldn't be a Catholic.\"[21]\nPonnuru has also been the author of a highly influential monograph on Japanese industrial policy, published jointly by the American Enterprise Institute and Center for Policy Studies.[22]\nPonnuru is a past contributor to Time and WashingtonPost.com. He has also written for other such national publications as The New York Times,[23][24][25][26][27] The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal,[28] Financial Times, Newsday, New York Post, The Weekly Standard, Policy Review, The New Republic, and First Things,\nan ecumenical and conservative religious journal.[29][30]\n\nPolicy[edit]\nPonnuru has long been a much sought after speaker on conservative domestic policy and their political implications; he has regularly been a featured guest at retreats for congressional Republicans, including the party's leadership.[31]\nPonnuru has often been identified as a leader of the \"reform conservative\" movement,[32] and was prominently featured in a 2014 New York Times Magazine cover story as one of the foremost conservative intellectuals who comprise it. The Times' Sam Tanenhaus described Ponnuru as one of a small group of young conservative Republicans, who, each one, \"was an intellectual prodigy in his 30s\" who together had \"become the leaders of a small band of reform conservatives, sometimes called reformicons, who believe the health of the G.O.P. hinges on jettisoning its age-old doctrine \u2014 orgiastic tax-cutting, the slashing of government programs, the championing of Wall Street \u2014 and using an altogether different vocabulary, backed by specific proposals, that will reconnect the party to middle-class and low-income voters.\"[33]\nIn 2014, Ponnuru co-edited, with Yuval Levin, Room to Grow: Conservative Reforms for a Limited Government and a Thriving Middle Class,[34] described as a reform conservative manifesto and policy agenda. (Ponnuru also contributed the book's concluding chapter, on constitutionalism.[35]) The book was widely praised; New York Times columnist David Brooks described it as a \"policy-laden manifesto... which is the most coherent and compelling policy agenda the American right has produced this century.\"[36]\nPonnuru's collaboration with Levin also won widespread praise for both men because of Levin's own high standing in the conservative movement and the prescient observations of both: Levin has been called \"probably the most influential conservative intellectual of the Obama era\" by Jonathan Chait of New York Magazine,[37] while the left-leaning The New Republic has described Levin as \"the conservative movement's great intellectual hope\" and has said that \"despite his youth, Levin had been anointed the next great neoconservative.\"[38]\n\nBooks[edit]\nPonnuru, Ramesh (2006).

RAND Corporation engages in research and development (R&D) across multiple fields and industries. Since the 1950s, RAND research has helped inform United States policy decisions on a wide variety of issues, including the space race, the Vietnam War, the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms confrontation, the creation of the Great Society social welfare programs, and national health care.\nThe RAND Corporation originated as \"Project RAND\" (from the phrase \"research and development\") in the postwar period immediately after World War II.[7][8] The United States Army Air Forces established Project RAND with the objective of investigating long-range planning of future weapons.[9] Douglas Aircraft Company was granted a contract to research intercontinental warfare.[9] Project RAND later evolved into the RAND Corporation, and expanded its research into civilian fields such as education and international affairs.[10] It was the first think tank to be regularly referred to as a \"think tank\".[1]\nRAND receives both public and private funding. Its funding sources include the U.S. government, private endowments,[6] corporations,[11] universities,[11] charitable foundations, U.S. state and local governments, international organizations, and to a small extent, by foreign governments.[11][12]\n\n\nOverview[edit]\nRAND has approximately 1,850 employees. Its American locations include: Santa Monica, California (headquarters); Arlington, Virginia; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Boston, Massachusetts.[13] The RAND Gulf States Policy Institute has an office in New Orleans, Louisiana. RAND Europe is located in Cambridge, United Kingdom, and Brussels, Belgium.[14] RAND Australia is located in Canberra, Australia.[15]\nRAND is home to the Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School, one of eight original graduate programs in public policy and the first to offer a PhD. The program aims to provide practical experience for students, who work with RAND analysts on addressing real-world problems. The campus is at RAND's Santa Monica research facility. The Pardee RAND School is the world's largest PhD-granting program in policy analysis.[16]\nUnlike many other programs, all Pardee RAND Graduate School students receive fellowships to cover their education costs. This allows them to dedicate their time to engage in research projects and provides them with on-the-job training.[16] RAND also offers a number of internship and fellowship programs allowing students and others to assist in conducting research for RAND projects. Most of these are short-term independent projects mentored by a RAND staff member.[17]\nRAND publishes the RAND Journal of Economics, a peer-reviewed journal of economics.[18]\nThirty-two recipients of the Nobel Prize, primarily in the fields of economics and physics, have been associated with RAND at some point in their career.[19][20]\n\nHistory[edit]\nProject RAND[edit]\nRAND was created after individuals in the War Department, the Office of Scientific Research and Development, and industry began to discuss the need for a private organization to connect operational research with research and development decisions.[17] The immediate impetus for the creation of RAND was a fateful conversation in September 1945 between General Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold and Douglas executive Franklin R. Collbohm.[21] Both men were deeply worried that ongoing demobilization meant the federal government was about to lose direct control of the vast amount of American scientific brainpower assembled to fight World War II.[21]\nAs soon as Arnold realized Collbohm had been thinking along similar lines, he said, \"I know just what you're going to tell me. It's the most important thing we can do.\"[22] With Arnold's blessing, Collbohm quickly pulled in additional people from Douglas to help, and together with Donald Douglas, they convened with Arnold two days later at Hamilton Army Airfield to sketch out a general outline for Collbohm's proposed project.[22]\nDouglas engineer Arthur Emmons Raymond came up with the name Project RAND, from \"research and development\".[7] Collbohm suggested that he himself should serve as the project's first director, which he thought would be a temporary position while he searched for a permanent replacement for himself.[7] He later became RAND's first president and served in that capacity until his retirement in 1967.[23]\nOn 1 October 1945, Project RAND was set up under special contract to the Douglas Aircraft Company and began operations in December 1945.[17][24] In May 1946, the Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship was released.\n\nRAND Corporation[edit]\nBy late 1947, Douglas Aircraft executives had expressed their concerns that their close relationship with RAND might create conflict of interest problems on future hardware contracts. In February 1948, the chief of staff of the newly created United States Air Force approved the evolution of Project RAND into a nonprofit corporation, independent of Douglas.[17]\nOn 14 May 1948, RAND was incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under the laws of the State of California and on 1 November 1948, the Project RAND contract was formally transferred from the Douglas Aircraft Company to the RAND Corporation.[17] Initial capital for the spin-off was provided by the Ford Foundation.\nSince the 1950s, RAND research has helped inform United States policy decisions on a wide variety of issues, including the space race, the Vietnam War, the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms confrontation, the creation of the Great Society social welfare programs, the digital revolution, and national health care.[25] In the 1970s the Rand Corporation adjusted computer models it was using to recommend closures of fire stations in New York City so that fire stations were closed in the most fire-prone areas, home to Black and Puerto Rican residents, rather than in wealthier, more affluent neighborhoods.[26]\nRAND contributed to the doctrine of nuclear deterrence by mutually assured destruction (MAD), developed under the guidance of then-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and based upon their work with game theory.[27] Chief strategist Herman Kahn also posited the idea of a \"winnable\" nuclear exchange in his 1960 book On Thermonuclear War. This led to Kahn's being one of the models for the titular character of the film Dr.\u00a0Strangelove, in which RAND is spoofed as the \"BLAND Corporation\".[28][29]\nEven in the late 1940s and early 1950s, long before Sputnik, the RAND project was secretly recommending to the US government a major effort to design a human-made satellite that would take photographs from space and the rockets to put such a satellite in orbit.[30]\nRAND was not the first think tank, but during the 1960s, it was the first to be regularly referred to as a \"think tank\".[1]  Accordingly, RAND served as the \"prototype\" for the modern definition of that term.[1]\n\nMission[edit]\nRAND was incorporated as a non-profit organization to \"further promote scientific, educational, and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare and security of the United States of America\". Its self-declared mission is \"to help improve policy and decision making through research and analysis\", using its \"core values of quality and objectivity\".[31]\n\nAchievements[edit]\nRAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nThe achievements of RAND stem from its development of systems analysis. Important contributions are claimed in space systems and the United States' space program,[32] in computing and in artificial intelligence. RAND researchers developed many of the principles that were used to build the Internet.[33] RAND also contributed to the development and use of wargaming.[34][35]\nCurrent areas of expertise include: child policy, law, civil and criminal justice, education, health (public health and health care), international policy/foreign policy, labor markets, national security, defense policy, infrastructure, energy, environment, business and corporate governance, economic development, intelligence policy, long-range planning, crisis management and emergency management-disaster preparation, population studies, regional studies, comparative studies, science and technology, social policy, welfare, terrorism and counterterrorism, cultural policy, arts policy, and transportation.[36][12][10]\nRAND designed and conducted one of the largest and most important studies of health insurance between 1974 and 1982. The RAND Health Insurance Experiment, funded by the then\u2013U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, established an insurance corporation to compare demand for health services with their cost to the patient.[37][38]\nIn 2018, RAND began its Gun Policy in America initiative,[39] which resulted in comprehensive reviews of the evidence of the effects of gun policies in the United States. The second expanded review in 2020[40] analyzed almost 13,000 relevant studies on guns and gun violence since 1995 and selected 123 as having sufficient methodological rigor for inclusion. These were used to determine the level of scientific support for eighteen classes of gun policy.\n\nControversy[edit]\nAlmost since its inception, the RAND Corporation has been involved in controversial issues\u2014and its reports, recommendations and influence have been the subject of extensive public debate and controversy. Among these have been:\n\nCold War and potential nuclear conflict[41][42][43][44]\nCity government[45][46][47][48]\nVietnam War[49][50][51][52]\nTransparency in government[53][50][51]\nNational health insurance[54]\nAlcoholism[55]\nAuto insurance[56]\nIraq War[49][57]\nGun control[58][59][60]\nIn December 2023, the RAND Corporation was designated as \"undesirable\" in Russia.[61]\n\nNotable participants[edit]\nJohn von Neumann, consultant to the RAND Corporation[62]\nHenry H. \"Hap\" Arnold: General of the Air Force, United States Air Force\nKenneth Arrow: economist, won the Nobel Prize in Economics, developed the impossibility theorem in social choice theory\nBruno Augenstein: V.P., physicist, mathematician and space scientist\nRobert Aumann: mathematician, game theorist, won the Nobel Prize in Economics.\nJ.

Paul describes himself as a constitutional conservative and supporter of the Tea Party movement.\nPaul attended Baylor University and is a graduate of the Duke University School of Medicine. Paul was a practicing ophthalmologist in Bowling Green, Kentucky, from 1993 until his election to the Senate in 2010. He was re-elected to a second term in 2016, and won a third term in 2022.[2]\nPaul was a candidate for the Republican nomination in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He ended his campaign in February 2016 after finishing in fifth place during the Iowa caucuses. While he initially opposed Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries, he supported him following his nomination and became one of his top defenders in the U.S. Senate during his first impeachment trial,[3] though on key votes Paul aligned with Trump the third least among Republican senators during Trump's presidency.[4]\n\n\nEarly life\nRandal Howard Paul was born on January 7, 1963, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Carol (n\u00e9e Wells) and Ron Paul, who is also a politician and physician. The middle child of five, his siblings are Ronald \"Ronnie\" Paul Jr., Lori Paul Pyeatt, Robert Paul, and Joy Paul LeBlanc.[5][6]\nPaul was baptized in the Episcopal Church[7] and identified as a practicing Christian as a teenager.[8]\nDespite his father's libertarian views and strong support for individual rights,[8][9] the novelist Ayn Rand was not the inspiration for his first name. Growing up, he went by \"Randy\",[10] but his wife shortened it to \"Rand.\"[11][12]\nThe Paul family moved to Lake Jackson, Texas in 1968,[13] where he was reared[14][15] and where his father began a medical practice and for a period of time was the only obstetrician in Brazoria County.[16][13]\nWhen Rand was 13, his father Ron Paul was elected to the United States House of Representatives.[17] That same year, Paul attended the 1976 Republican National Convention, where his father headed Ronald Reagan's Texas delegation.[18] The younger Paul spent several summer vacations interning in his father's congressional office.[19] In his teenage years, Paul studied the Austrian economists that his father respected, as well as the writings of Objectivist philosopher Ayn Rand.[10] Paul went to Brazoswood High School and was on the swimming team and played defensive back on the football team.[8][14]\nPaul attended Baylor University from fall 1981 to summer 1984 and was enrolled in the honors program. During the time he spent at Baylor, he completed his pre-med requirements in two and a half years,[20] was involved in the swim team and the Young Conservatives of Texas and was a member of a tongue-in-cheek secret organization, the NoZe Brotherhood, known for its irreverent humor.[21] He regularly contributed to The Baylor Lariat student newspaper.[18] Paul left Baylor without completing his baccalaureate degree,[20] when he was accepted into his father's alma mater, the Duke University School of Medicine, which, at the time, did not require an undergraduate degree for admission to its graduate school. He earned an M.D. degree in 1988 and completed his residency in 1993.[22]\n\nMedical career\nAfter completing his residency in ophthalmology, Paul moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where he has been an \"active, licensed physician\" since 1993.[23][24] He worked for Downing McPeak Vision Centers for five years. In 1998, he joined a private medical group practice, the Graves Gilbert Clinic, in Bowling Green, for 10 years. In 2008, Paul formed his own private practice across the street from John Downing, his former employer at Downing McPeak.[25] After his election to the U.S. Senate, he merged his practice with Downing's medical practice.[26]\nPaul has faced two malpractice lawsuits between 1993 and 2010; he was cleared in one case while the other was settled for $50,000.[25] His medical work has been praised by Downing and he has medical privileges at two Bowling Green hospitals.[25] In April 2020, after recovering from COVID-19, Paul began volunteering at a hospital in Bowling Green, assisting them in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kentucky.[27]\nPaul specializes in cataract and glaucoma surgeries, LASIK procedures, and corneal transplants.[11] As a member of the Bowling Green Noon Lions Club, Paul founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic in 2009 to help provide eye surgery and exams for those who cannot afford to pay.[28] Paul won the Melvin Jones Fellow Award for Dedicated Humanitarian Services from the Lions Club International Foundation for his work establishing the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic.[29]\n\nNational Board of Ophthalmology\nIn 1995, Paul was certified to practice by the American Board of Ophthalmology (ABO).[30] Three years earlier, the ABO had changed its certification program, which previously awarded lifetime certifications, and required ophthalmologists to recertify every 10 years, while those who had already been given lifetime certification were not required to recertify. Paul felt this was unfair and campaigned to have all ophthalmologists recertify every ten years.\nIn 1999, he incorporated the National Board of Ophthalmology (NBO) to offer an alternative certification system, at a cost substantially lower than that of the ABO.[31][32][33] Board members were Paul, his wife, and his father-in-law.[34] His father-in-law, the board's secretary, stated \"I never did go to any meetings\u00a0... There was really nothing involved. It was more just a title than anything else, for me\".[31] By Paul's estimate, about 50 or 60 doctors were certified by the NBO.[31] The NBO was not accepted as an accrediting entity by organizations such as the American Board of Medical Specialties, and its certification was considered invalid by many hospitals and insurance companies. Paul did not file the required paperwork with the Kentucky Secretary of State's office for the NBO's renewal to operate in 2000. He recreated the board in 2005, but it was again dissolved in 2011.[35]\nPaul maintained his own ABO certification from 1995 to 2005. Specialty certification does not affect physician licensure, and Paul's medical license has been valid continuously, with no board actions, since June 1993.[36]\n\nPolitical activism\nPaul was head of the local chapter of the Young Conservatives of Texas during his time at Baylor University.[18] In 1984, Paul took a semester off to aid his father's campaign in the 1984 United States Senate election in Texas, which was eventually lost to fellow Representative Phil Gramm.[18]\nWhile attending Duke University School of Medicine, Paul volunteered for his father's 1988 Libertarian presidential campaign.[19]\nIn response to the breaking of President Bush's promise not to raise taxes, Paul founded the North Carolina Taxpayers Union in 1991.[19] In 1994, Paul founded the anti-tax organization Kentucky Taxpayers United (KTU), and was chair of the organization from its inception. He has often cited his involvement with KTU as the foundation of his involvement with state politics.[37] The group[38][39] examined Kentucky legislators' records on taxation and spending and encouraged politicians to publicly pledge to vote uniformly against tax increases.[40][41]\nPaul managed his father's successful 1996 congressional campaign, in which the elder Paul returned to the House after a twelve-year absence. The elder Paul defeated incumbent Democrat-turned-Republican Greg Laughlin in the Republican primary, despite Laughlin's support from the NRCC and Republican leaders such as Newt Gingrich and George W. Bush.[18]\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in 2010 that, although Paul had told a Kentucky television audience as recently as September 2009 that KTU published ratings each year on state legislators' tax positions and that \"we've done that for about 15 years\", the group had stopped issuing its ratings and report cards after 2002 and had been legally dissolved by the state in 2000 after failing to file registration documents.[37]\nPaul spoke on his father's behalf when his father was campaigning for office,[42] including throughout the elder Paul's run in the 2008 presidential election, during which Rand campaigned door-to-door in New Hampshire[43] and spoke in Boston at a fundraising rally for his father on the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party.[44]\nIn February 2014, Paul joined the Tea Party-affiliated conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks in filing a class-action lawsuit charging that the federal government's bulk collection of Americans' phone records metadata is a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.[45][46][47] Commenting on the lawsuit at a press conference, Paul said, \"I'm not against the NSA, I'm not against spying, I'm not against looking at phone records... I just want you to go to a judge, have an individual's name and [get] a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says.\"[45] He also said there was no evidence the surveillance of phone metadata had stopped terrorism.[45] Critics, including Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz[48] and Steven Aftergood, the director of the American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy,[47] called the lawsuit a political \"stunt\". Paul's political campaign organization said that the names of members of the public who went to Paul's websites and signed on as potential class-action participants would be available in the organization's database for future campaign use.[45][49]\nOn the announcement of the filing of the lawsuit, Mattie Fein, the spokeswoman for and former wife of attorney Bruce Fein, complained that Fein's intellectual contribution to the lawsuit had been stolen and that he had not been properly paid for his work.[50] Paul's representatives denied the charge, and Fein issued a statement saying that Mattie Fein had not been authorized to speak for him on the matter and that he had in fact been paid for his work on the lawsuit.[50]\nPaul is co-author of a book entitled The Tea Party Goes to Washington (2011)[51][52] and also the author of Government Bullies: How Everyday Americans Are Being Harassed, Abused, and Imprisoned by the Feds (2012).[53] Paul was included in Time magazine's world's 100 most influential people, for 2013 and 2014.[54][55] He is also a contributor to Time magazine.[56]\n\nElection to U.S. Senate\nMain article: 2010 United States Senate election in Kentucky\nPrimary campaign\nPaul speaking at a Tea Party rally in Hawesville, Kentucky, on November 21, 2009\nAt the beginning of 2009, there was movement by political supporters of his father to draft Paul in a bid to replace beleaguered Republican Kentucky senator Jim Bunning. Paul's potential candidacy was discussed in the Los Angeles Times[57] and locally in the Kentucky press.[58] Paul's father said, \"Should Senator Bunning decide not to run, I think Rand would make a great U.S. Senator.\"[59] On April 15, 2009, Paul gave his first political speech as a potential candidate at a Tea Party rally held in his town of Bowling Green, Kentucky, where more than 700 people had gathered in support of the Tea Party movement.The Tea Party Goes to Washington. Nashville: Center Street. 2011.\nOn May 1, 2009, Paul said that if Bunning, whose fundraising in 2009 matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election,[60] declined to seek a third term, he would almost certainly run in the Republican Party primary to succeed him,[61] and formed an exploratory committee soon after, while still promising to stay out of the race if Bunning ultimately decided to run for reelection. Paul made this announcement on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, though a Kentucky news site first broke the news.[62]\nOn July 28, 2009, Bunning announced that he would not run for reelection in the face of insufficient fundraising. The announcement left only Paul and Secretary of State Trey Grayson as the remaining candidates for the Republican nomination,[63] with Paul announcing on August 5, 2009, that he would officially run for the U.S. Senate as a Republican. The announcement was made through a series of national TV events, radio, and other programs, as well as newspapers in Kentucky.[64][65][66]\nOn August 20, 2009, Paul's supporters planned a moneybomb to kick off his campaign. The official campaign took in $433,509 in 24 hours. His website reported that this set a new record in Kentucky's political fundraising history in a 24-hour period.[67] A second \"moneybomb\" was held on September 23, 2009, to counter a D.C. fundraiser being held for primary opponent Trey Grayson, by 23 Republican United States Senators.[68] The theme was a UFC \"fight\" between \"We the People\" and the \"D.C. Insiders\".[69] Later in the campaign, Paul claimed his pledge to not take money from lobbyists and senators who had voted for the bailout was only a \"primary pledge\";[70] he subsequently held a fundraiser in Washington, D.C., with the same senators who had been the target of the September 23, 2009, \"moneybomb\". Paul ended up raising some $3 million during the primary period. Paul's fundraising was aided by his father's network of supporters.[18]\nAlthough Grayson was considered the frontrunner in July 2009,[71] Paul found success characterizing Grayson as a \"career politician\" and challenging Grayson's conservatism. Paul ran an ad in February that made an issue out of Grayson's September 2008 admission that he voted for Bill Clinton when he was 20 years old.[72] James Dobson, a Christian evangelical figure, endorsed Grayson on April 26 based on the advice of what Dobson described as \"senior members of the GOP\", but on May 3 the Paul campaign announced that Dobson had changed his endorsement to Paul[73] after Paul and some Paul supporters had lobbied Dobson insisting on Paul's social conservative bona fides.[74]\nOn May 18, Paul won the Republican Senatorial primary by a 23% margin,[75][76] meaning he would face the Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway, in the November 2 general election.[77]\n\nGeneral campaign\nPaul greeting supporters at Bowman Field in Louisville, Kentucky, on November 1, 2010\nIn the 2010 general election, Paul faced Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway. The campaign attracted $8.5 million in contributions from outside groups, of which $6 million was spent to help Paul and $2.5 million to help Conway. This money influx was in addition to the money spent by the candidates themselves: $6 million by Paul and $4.7 million by Conway.[78][79]\nOn June 28, 2010, Paul supporters held their first post-primary online fundraising drive, this time promoted as a \"money blast\".[80][81]\nPaul's campaign got off to a rough start after his comments on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stirred controversy.[82] Paul stated that he favored 9 out of 10 titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but that had he been a senator during the 1960s, he would have raised some questions on the constitutionality of Title II of the Act.[83] Paul said that he abhors racism, and that he would have marched with Martin Luther King Jr. to repeal Jim Crow laws. He later released a statement declaring that he would have voted for the Act and stated \"unequivocally\u00a0... that I will not support any efforts to repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964\".[84][85] Later he generated more controversy by characterizing statements made by Obama Administration officials regarding the Deepwater Horizon oil spill cleanup as sounding \"un-American\".[86]\nPaul defeated Conway in the general election with 56% of the vote to 44% for Conway.\n\nU.S. Senate\n112th Congress (2011\u20132013)\nPaul being sworn in as a senator by Vice President Joe Biden, along with his family, in the Old Senate Chamber in the U.S. Capitol, January 2011\nPaul campaigning with his father, Ron Paul, for his 2012 presidential campaign in Waterloo, Iowa, on August 10, 2011\nPaul was sworn in on January 5, 2011, along with his father, who was simultaneously in the House of Representatives.[87]\nPaul was assigned to be on the Energy and Natural Resources, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and Small Business committees.[88] Paul also formed the Senate Tea Party Caucus with Jim DeMint and Mike Lee as its inaugural members.[89] His first legislative proposal was to cut $500\u00a0billion from federal spending in one year. This proposal included cutting the Department of Education by 83\u00a0percent and the United States Department of Homeland Security by 43\u00a0percent, as well as folding the Department of Energy into the Department of Defense and eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seven independent agencies would be eliminated, and food stamps would be cut by 30\u00a0percent. Under Paul's proposal, defense spending would be reduced by 6.5\u00a0percent and international aid would be eliminated.[90][91][92] He later proposed a five-year budget plan intended to balance the budget.[93]\nIn February, Paul was one of two Republicans to vote against extending three key provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act (roving wiretaps, searches of business records, and conducting surveillance of \"lone wolves\"\u00a0\u2014 individuals not linked to terrorist groups).[94][95]\nOn March 2, Paul was one of nine senators to vote against a stopgap bill that cut $4\u00a0billion from the budget and would temporarily prevent a government shutdown, saying that it did not cut enough from the budget.[96] One week later, he voted against the Democratic and Republican budget proposals to keep funding the federal government, saying that both bills did not cut enough spending. Both bills failed to pass the Senate. He later voted against stopgap measures on March 17 and April 8, both of which passed the senate.[97][98]\nOn April 14, he was one of 19 senators to vote against a budget that cut $38.5\u00a0billion from the budget and funded the government for the remainder of the fiscal year.[99]\nPaul voiced opposition to U.S. intervention in the Libyan Civil War and has criticized President Barack Obama for not gaining congressional consent for Operation Odyssey Dawn.[100][101] During the debt ceiling crisis, the Senator stated that he would only support raising the debt ceiling if a balanced budget amendment was enacted.[102] Paul was a supporter of the Cut, Cap and Balance Act, which was tabled by Democratic opposition.[103] On August 3, Paul voted against a bill that would raise the debt ceiling.[104]\nOn September 7, Paul called for a vote of no confidence in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.[105] Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that would strengthen safety rules for oil and gas pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough.[106] In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36\u00a0million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green.[107] Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program.[108]\nIn June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election.[109] However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.[110]\n\n113th Congress (2013\u20132015)\nFor the 113th Congress, Paul was added to the Foreign Relations committee and retained his spot on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and Small Business committees.[111]\nOn March 6\u20137, 2013, Paul engaged in a filibuster to delay voting on the nomination of John O. Brennan as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Paul questioned the Obama administration's use of drones and the stated legal justification for their potential use within the United States. Paul held the floor for 12 hours and 52 minutes.[112] He ceded to several Republican senators and Democratic senator, Ron Wyden, who generally also questioned drone usage.[113][114] Paul said his purpose was to challenge drone policy in general and specifically as it related to noncombatants on U.S. soil. He requested a pledge from the Administration that noncombatants would not be targeted on U.S. soil.[115] Attorney General Eric Holder responded that the President is not authorized to deploy extrajudicial punishment without due process, against non-combatant citizens. Press Secretary Jay Carney read Holder's letter, indicating president Obama's support, \"The president has not and would not use drone strikes against American citizens on American soil\"[116] Press Paul answered that he was \"quite happy\" with the response.[117] The filibuster was ended with a cloture vote of 81 to 16, and Brennan was confirmed by the Senate with a vote of 63 to 34.[118]\n\nPaul speaking during filibuster on the Senate floor on March 6, 2013\nIn March 2013, Paul, with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, threatened another filibuster, this one opposing any legislative proposals to expand federal gun control measures.[119] The filibuster was attempted on April 11, 2013, but was dismissed by cloture, in a 68\u201331 vote.[120] Also in March 2013, Paul endorsed fellow Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell's 2014 re-election campaign.[121] McConnell had previously hired Paul's 2010 campaign manager, Jesse Benton, as his own campaign manager.[122] Paul's endorsement was seen as a major win for McConnell in avoiding a challenge in the Republican primary.[121]\nIn response to Detroit's declaration of bankruptcy, Paul stated he would not allow the government to attempt to bail out Detroit. In a phone interview with Breitbart News on July 19, 2013, Paul said, \"I basically say he is bailing them out over my dead body because we don't have any money in Washington.\" Paul said he thought a federal bailout would send the wrong message to other cities with financial problems.[123]\nIn September, Paul stated that the United States should avoid military intervention in the ongoing Syrian Civil War.[124] In an op-ed, Paul disputed the Obama administration's claims that the threat of military force caused Syria's government to consider turning over its chemical weapons, instead arguing that the opposition to military action in Syria, and the delay that it caused, led to diplomatic progress.[125]\nIn October 2013, Paul was the subject of some controversy when it was discovered that he had plagiarized from Wikipedia part of a speech in support of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli. Referencing the movie Gattaca, Paul quoted almost verbatim from the Wikipedia article about the film without citing the source.[126][127][128] Evidence soon surfaced that Paul had copied sentences in a number of his other speeches nearly verbatim from other authors without giving credit to the original sources,[129][130] including in the speech he had given as the Tea Party rebuttal to the president's 2013 State of the Union Address. In addition, a three-page-long passage of Paul's book Government Bullies was taken directly from an article by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation.[131][132] When it became apparent that Paul's op-ed in The Washington Times on mandatory minimums and related testimony he had given before the Senate Judiciary Committee both contained material that was virtually identical to an article that had been published by another author in The Week a few days earlier,[133] The Washington Times said that the newspaper would no longer publish the weekly column Paul had been contributing to the paper.[134] After a week of almost daily news reports of new allegations of plagiarism, Paul said that he was being held to an \"unfair standard\", but would restructure his office in order to prevent mistakes in the future, if that would be what it would take \"to make people leave me the hell alone.\"[135]\nIn response to political turmoil in Ukraine in early 2014, Paul initially said that the United States should remain mindful of the fact that although the Cold War is over, Russia remains a military power with long-range nuclear missiles. He said that the United States should try to maintain a \"respectful relationship with Russia\" and avoid taking actions that the Russians might view as a provocation, such as seeking to have Ukraine join NATO or otherwise interfering in Russia's relationship with Ukraine.[136]\nTwo weeks later, after the Russian parliament authorized the use of military force in Ukraine[137] and Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military exercises along Russia's border with Ukraine,[138] Paul began taking a different tone.[139] He wrote: \"Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a gross violation of that nation's sovereignty and an affront to the international community\u00a0... Putin must be punished for violating the Budapest Memorandum, and Russia must learn that the U.S. will isolate it if it insists on acting like a rogue nation.\"[140] He said that the United States and European allies could retaliate against Russia's military aggression without any need for military action. He urged that the United States impose economic sanctions on Russia and resume an effort to build defensive anti-missile installations in Poland and the Czech Republic. He also called for the United States to take steps as a counterweight to Russia's strategic influence on Europe's oil and gas supply, such as lifting restrictions on new exploration and drilling for fossil fuels in the United States along with immediate approval of the controversial Keystone Pipeline, which he said would allow the United States to ship more oil and gas to Europe if Russia attempts to cut off its own supply to Europe.[140]\nPaul played a leading role in blocking a treaty with Switzerland that would enable the IRS to conduct tax evasion probes, arguing that the treaty would infringe upon Americans' privacy.[141] Paul received the 2014 Distinguished Service Award from the Center for the National Interest (formally called the Nixon Center) for his public policy work.[142][143]\nIn response to reports that the CIA infiltrated the computers of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Paul called for the firing of CIA Director John O. Brennan.[144] In December 2014, Paul supported the actions taken by the Obama administration to change United States policy towards Cuba and to ease trade restrictions with that country.[145]\n\n114th Congress (2015\u20132017)\nIn the beginning of 2015, Senator Paul re-introduced the Federal Reserve Transparency Act.[146] Paul also introduced the FAIR Act, or Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act, which would restrict civil forfeiture proceedings.[147] Paul spoke for ten and a half hours on May 20, 2015, in opposition to the reauthorization of Section 215 of the Patriot Act.[148][149] Sections of the Patriot Act were prevented from being reauthorized on June 1.[150]\nAfter the death of Antonin Scalia in February 2016, on February 15, Paul indicated that he would oppose any nomination by President Obama to replace the late Supreme Court Justice.[151]\nDuring a press briefing on May 6, 2016, President Obama called on Paul to stop \"blocking the implementation of tax treaties that have been pending for years\", arguing that they assisted law enforcement in off shore investigations into tax evasion.[152] Paul advocated for the abolition of gun-free zones during a speech to the National Rifle Association of America on May 20, citing repeated tragedies occurring in these locations.[153] On June 6, Paul spoke of introducing legislation to cease Selective Service, three days after the death of Muhammad Ali, after whom he intended to name the legislation in tribute.[154]\n\n115th Congress (2017\u20132019)\nIn March 2017, Paul introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists Act that would prohibit the use of United States government funds to provide assistance to Al Qaeda, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and to countries supporting those organizations.[155][156] On March 16, Senator John McCain (Rep) accused Paul of being an agent of Vladimir Putin after Paul objected to adding Montenegro to NATO.[157][158] Paul responded the following day by saying McCain \"makes a really, really strong case for term limits\", suggesting McCain had become \"a little unhinged\" as a result of his seniority.[159] On April 7, McCain said he did not pay attention to any of Paul's rhetoric and that the latter did not have \"any real influence\" in the United States Senate.[160]\nPaul questioned President Trump's April 2017 missile strike to Syria by saying, \"While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked.\" He said that further action should not be taken without congressional authorization.[161][162]\nPaul was one of 22 senators to sign a letter[163] to President Donald Trump urging him to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement in May 2017. According to The Guardian, Paul has received over $250,000 from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012.[164] In July, Rand Paul joined Reps. Justin Amash (R-MI), Thomas Massie (R-KY), John Duncan Jr. (R-TN) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in opposing a bill that would impose new economic sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea. President Trump opposed the bill, pointing out that relations with Russia were already \"at an all-time and dangerous low\". He did, however, sign the bill though likely out of political pressure.[165]\nPaul confirmed in an October 2017 interview he would not vote for the Republican budget in the Senate unless billions in spending were removed from the plan: \"If leadership is unwilling to compromise with somebody who is concerned about the debt, then they deserve to lose.\"[166]\nIn February 2018, Republican senators introduced an immigration framework akin to that proposed by President Trump and with his support that called for $25 billion being provided for border security in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million immigrants brought into the US illegally.[167] Paul was one of fourteen Republican senators to vote against the proposal.[168]\nFiveThirtyEight, which tracks Congressional votes, found that Paul had voted with Donald Trump's positions the least out of all Republicans, only voting with him 74% of the time by August 2018.[169] In December 2018, in the wake of court filings implicating President Trump's involvement in campaign finance violations, including an attempt to buy a woman's silence, Paul played down the alleged violations and said that they should not be \"over-criminalized.\"[170] Paul said that the campaign finance violations were \"an error in filing paperwork or not categorizing\" and that going after such violations would turn the U.S. into a \"banana republic, where every president gets prosecuted and every president gets thrown in jail when they're done with office.\"[170]\n\nAffordable Care Act repeal\nPaul introduced a bill on January 25, 2017, that sought to replace the Affordable Care Act which included each person's having a tax credit of $5,000 and not requiring everyone to have coverage, unlike Obamacare.[171]\nOn March 2, after marching to the House of Representatives side of Capitol Hill, Paul was filmed knocking on a door while demanding to see their copy of the replacing and repealing the Affordable Care Act bill.[172] Paul spoke with President Trump over the phone on March 6, Paul telling him that the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act should be two separate bills. Two days later, Paul said Republicans were united in repealing the Affordable Care Act but divided in their stances on its replacement.[173] On March 12, Paul accused House Speaker Paul Ryan of being misleading in portraying supporters of the American Health Care Act of 2017 as not being negotiable,[174] and three days later, March 15, furthered that Ryan was \"selling\" President Trump \"a bill of goods\" that he had not explained fully to the president.[175]\nAfter the bill was pulled by Republican leaders from a vote, Paul released a statement on March 24 thanking House conservatives for rebelling \"against ObamaCare Lite.\"[176] Later, on April 2, Paul golfed with Trump and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where they discussed a variety of topics, including healthcare.[177][178]\nPaul told reporters on June 15 that he was willing to vote for a partial repeal, but not the implementation of new Republican entitlement programs, which he identified as present in both House and Senate versions of the bill.[179] Paul also told reporters on September 11 that he did not believe the Graham-Cassidy bill would pass.[180] Paul tweeted on September 15 that Graham-Cassidy retained \"90% of Obamacare\" and dubbed it \"more Obamacare Lite\".[181]\nOn September 19, Paul asserted the Graham-Cassidy bill as immortalizing the Affordable Care Act and \"a big government boondoggle of a trillion dollars of spending\" that Republicans should abandon in favor of pursuing measures that would allow for health insurance to be purchased across state lines.[182] On September 22, after President Trump tweeted that \"Rand Paul, or whoever votes against Hcare Bill, will forever (future political campaigns) be known as 'the Republican who saved Obamacare'\", Paul responded that he would not be coerced into supporting Graham-Cassidy with bribes or bullying.[183]\n\n116th Congress (2019\u20132021)\nPaul at the 2019 Turning Point USA Winter Gala at Mar-a-Lago\nIn January 2019, Paul condemned Senator Mitt Romney for writing an editorial criticizing President Trump. Paul said that Romney's criticism of Trump's character was bad for the country and for the Republican Party.[184]\nOn July 17, 2019, Paul blocked Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's motion for unanimous consent on a bill renewing the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund along with Utah Senator Mike Lee. The fund was estimated to run out by the end of the year; the bill would renew it until the year 2090. Paul argued that he was not blocking the bill, but rather seeking a vote on an amendment that would offset the new spending by other spending cuts due to the deficit. In a segment on Fox News, which went viral, comedian Jon Stewart and 9/11 first responder John Feal rebuked Paul, accusing him of hypocritical \"fiscal responsibility virtue signalling\", for delaying passage of the bill, while at the same time he voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which increased the deficit.[185] In response, Paul said he has always insisted on \"pay-go provisions\" for any increase in spending, including for disaster relief funding, and called Stewart uninformed and a part of a \"left-wing mob\".[186]\n\nPaul speaking at a Turning Point USA event in 2020\nOn November 4, 2019, Paul called on the media to reveal the secret identity of Trump's Ukraine quid pro quo whistleblower after threatening to reveal the name himself.[187]\nIn February 2020, Paul criticized YouTube for removing a video of his floor speech about the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. His speech contained a controversial question for impeachment manager Adam Schiff and counsel for the president: \"Are you aware that House Intelligence Committee staffer Shawn Misko had a close relationship with [...] when at the National Security Council together?\"[188][189][190]\nOn February 26, 2020, Paul's wife purchased between $1,000 and $15,000 worth of stock in Gilead Sciences, a pharmaceutical company that produces an antiviral drug used to treat COVID-19, before the threat from the coronavirus was fully understood by the public; his disclosure of this transaction came 16 months after the legal deadline set forth in the Stock Act, a law that combats insider trading.[191] Paul's office stated that the disclosure form was filled up on time, but by mistake was not submitted.[192] This purchase was the only stock in an individual company that Paul or his wife bought in the previous 10 years.[192]\nIn September 2020, Paul was the lone Republican to vote against the COVID-19 aid package introduced by Senator Mitch McConnell, joining the Democrats who unanimously voted against it. Paul's grievance with the bill was the accumulation to the debt it would have triggered.[193][194]\nAfter the 2020 presidential election, Paul refused to accept Democratic candidate Joe Biden's victory against Trump and falsely claimed that the election was \"stolen.\"[195]\n\n117th Congress (2021\u20132023)\nPaul gives a speech during the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.\nInitially, Paul insisted that the 2020 elections were fraudulent,[196][197] and in December 2020, claimed that the election \"in many ways was stolen.\"[198] Later, he accepted the state-certified electors that named Biden.\nIn a press release and during the Electoral College session to count the vote, which followed the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Paul argued that the electoral college is an indispensable friend of democracy in checking the danger of centralized power in deciding elections.[199] He additionally condemned the attack while it occurred, calling it \"violence and mob rule\" and \"un-American.\" He blamed the rioters as setting back election reform discussions and asked them to \"just stop it.\"[200][201] Later that month, Paul continued to make false claims of fraud in the 2020 election and refused to say that the election was not stolen.[197] In the subsequent second impeachment trial of Trump, which sought to convict him on charges of incitement of insurrection, Paul questioned the constitutionality of it due to Trump having left office by the time it reached the Senate, as well as defending him against the charges, \"I want Democrats to raise their hands if they have ever given a speech that says 'take back,' 'fight for your country,' who hasn't used the words fight figuratively?\"[202] Once Trump was impeached in January 2021, Paul introduced a motion to the Senate declaring the impeachment to be unconstitutional. Five Republicans joined all 50 Democrats to defeat the motion 55 to 45. With 45 Republican senators supporting him, Paul stated the impeachment was 'dead on arrival'.[203] Paul formally voted against the charges on February 13, 2021.[204]\nIn January 2022, a video resurfaced of Paul advising medical students at the University of Louisville in 2013, during which he said \"misinformation works, so try to trick your opponents\".[205]\nIn May 2022, Paul blocked a bipartisan bill that would provide $40 billion in aid for Ukraine during the Russian invasion, citing the need to create a special inspector general to oversee how the aid is spent.[206]\n\n118th Congress (2023\u2013present)\nIn March 2023, Paul gained particular media attention after he crossed party lines and blocked fellow Republican Senator Josh Hawley's \"No TikTok on United States Devices Act\", which would ban the app TikTok in the United States.[207][208] In a statement afterwards, Paul said he believes a ban would be a violation of First Amendment rights, adding that it would not necessarily protect the users' information because U.S.-based tech companies have failed to secure data before.[209]\nIn late September 2023, a viral photo of a barefoot Paul wearing a red bathrobe outside the Capitol Building began to circulate on social media.[210] The photo, which was interpreted by many to be a sendup of the attire of Senator John Fetterman following the recent relaxation of the Senate's dress code, was later revealed to be AI-generated.\nCommittee assignments\n\nCommittee on Foreign Relations\nSubcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia and Counterterrorism\nSubcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation\nSubcommittee on Multilateral International Development, Multilateral Institutions, and International Economic, Energy and Environmental Policy\nSubcommittee on State Department and USAID Management, International Operations and Bilateral International Development\nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\nSubcommittee on Children and Families (chairman)\nSubcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations\nSubcommittee on Emergency Management, Intergovernmental Relations, and the District of Columbia (chairman)\nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship (Ranking Member)\nOn February 3, 2021, Paul was named a ranking member of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.[211]\nCaucuses\n\nSenate Republican Conference\n2016 presidential campaign\nMain article: Rand Paul 2016 presidential campaign\nFurther information: 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries\nBackground\nPaul speaking at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, on March 14, 2013\nPaul speaking at a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa, October 2015\nPaul was considered a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency of the United States since at least January 2013.[212] He delivered the Tea Party response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on February 13, 2013,[213] while Marco Rubio gave the official Republican response. This prompted some pundits to call that date the start of the 2016 Republican primaries.[214] That year, he spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C., where he won the 2016 Presidential straw poll. Paul went on to win the straw poll for the next two years as well, leading to some considering Paul to be a front runner for the nomination, although CPAC attendees are typically considered younger and more libertarian-minded than average Republican voters.[215][216][217]\nIn a speech at the GOP Freedom Summit in April 2014, Paul insisted that the GOP has to broaden its appeal in order to grow as a party. To do so, he said it cannot be the party of \"fat cats, rich people and Wall Street\" and that the conservative movement has never been about rich people or privilege, \"we are the middle class\", he said. Paul also said that conservatives must present a message of justice and concern for the unemployed and be against government surveillance to attract new people to the movement, including the young, Hispanics, and black voters.[218]\nDuring the 2014 election, Paul launched a social media campaign titled \"Hillary's Losers\" which was meant to highlight many of the Democratic candidates that lost their bids for the U.S. Senate despite endorsements from Hillary Clinton. Clinton was also a candidate for President and eventually won the Democratic Party's nomination, going on to lose to Donald Trump in the general election.[219]\nPaul began to assemble his campaign team, setting up campaign offices and hiring his campaign manager in the beginning of 2015, fueling speculation that he was preparing to enter the Presidential race.[220] Paul officially announced his presidential candidacy on April 7, 2015. Within a day of his announcement, Paul raised $1 million.[221]\n\nSenate re-election\nSee also: 2016 United States Senate election in Kentucky\nIn April 2011, Paul filed to run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2016.[222] Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running for re-election.[223] In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed a bill that would allow Paul to run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up.[224][225][226]\nPaul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority).[227][228] However, the Democrats retained their 54\u201346 majority in the State House.[229][230][231] Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for president.[232]\n\nExit from presidential campaign\nPaul announced the suspension of his presidential campaign on February 3, 2016, shortly after the Iowa caucus, where he finished in fifth place.[233]\n\n2024 presidential election\nMain article: 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries\nOn January 11, 2024, Rand Paul announced that he a major announcement about the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries planned for the following morning.[234] The next day, Paul delivered an anti-endorsement against Nikki Haley, launching a website called \"Never Nikki.\" In particular, Paul noted his opposition toward Haley's interventionist foreign policy, especially increasing taxpayer funding for Ukraine and aligning with Republicans that might want to \u201cbomb Tehran tomorrow.\u201d[235] He added that he liked Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but he declined to officially endorse any of them.[236]\n\nPolitical positions\nMain article: Political positions of Rand Paul\nThis article is part of a series onConservatismin the United States\nSchools\nCompassionate\nFiscal\nFusion\nLibertarian\nModerate\nMovement\nNeo\nPaleo\nProgressive\nSocial\nTraditionalist\n\n\nPrinciples\nAmerican exceptionalism\nAnti-communism\nChristian nationalism\nClassical liberalism\nConstitutionalism\nFamily values\nJudeo-Christian values\nLimited government\nMilitarism\nMoral absolutism\nNatural law\nPatriotism\nRepublicanism\nRight to bear arms\nRule of law\nTradition\n\n\nHistory\nConservative coalition\nConservative Democrat\nConservative Manifesto\nLoyalists\nMcCarthyism\nModern timeline\nNew Right\nOld Right\nOverview\nReagan Doctrine\nReaganomics\nStalwart Republicans\nSouthern Agrarians\n\n\nIntellectuals\nBabbitt\nBoorstin\nBozell Jr.\nBuchanan\nBuckley\nBurnham\nChambers\nDolan\nEliot\nGeorge\nGoldberg\nGottfried\nHanson\nHazony\nHoppe\nJaffa\nKirk\nKirkpatrick\nKreeft\nKristol (Bill)\nKristol (Irving)\nKuehnelt-Leddihn\nLaffer\nLasch\nLodge\nLovecraft\nLukacs\nMansfield\nMeese\nMeyer\nNisbet\nNock\nPodhoretz\nRansom\nSantayana\nSowell\nStrauss\nViereck\nVoegelin\nWashington\nWeaver\nWill\n\n\nPoliticians\nAbbott\nAdams\nQuincy Adams\nAgnew\nBuchanan\nBush (George H.

He supports term limits, a balanced budget amendment, and the Read the Bills Act, in addition to the widespread reduction of federal spending and taxation. He favors a flat tax rate of 14.5% for individuals and business, while eliminating the FICA payroll taxes, as well as taxes on inheritance, gifts, capital gains, dividends, and interest.[241] Paul has frequently appeared on Infowars with radio show host and right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.[242][243][244][245] Ideologically, the American Conservative Union has given Paul a lifetime conservative rating of 96% and the Conservative Review gave him a 92% score.[246] Since the 2016 Republican primary, when Paul was highly critical of Trump, he has \"become one of the president's closest allies despite occasionally voting against Trump's nominees and legislative proposals.\"[184] As of June 2020, according to FiveThirtyEight, Paul had voted with President Trump's position on congressional issues 70% of the time, the second lowest among all Republican senators.[247]\n\nAbortion\nPaul describes himself as \"100% pro life\", believing that legal personhood begins at fertilization.[248][249][250] In 2009, his position was to ban abortion under all circumstances.[251][252] Since 2010, he has said he would allow for a doctor's discretion in life-threatening cases such as ectopic pregnancies.[253] In 2011, Paul signed onto the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act which was intended to prohibit federal funding for abortion, with the exception of abortions in the case of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother.[254]\n\nImmigration\nOn September 5, 2017, the Trump administration announced the intended rescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In tweets responding to the act, Paul stated the executive order that created DACA was illegal and congressional bipartisanship was needed to solve or fix the program.[255]\nPaul was one of 11 Republicans in 2019 to vote against Trump's demand for \"emergency border funding\".[256]\n\nLGBTQ+\nPaul has said that same-sex marriage \"offends [himself] and a lot of people\" on a personal level, and said there is a \"crisis that allows people to think there would be some other sorts of marriage.\"[257][258] Prior to the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage across the United States, Paul held the view that the decision to ban same-sex marriage should be in the hands of states.[259] Following the Court's decision, Paul said in 2015, \"While I disagree with Supreme Court's redefinition of marriage, I believe that all Americans have the right to contract. The Constitution is silent on the question of marriage because marriage has always been a local issue. Our founding fathers went to the local courthouse to be married, not to Washington, D.C. I've often said I don't want my guns or my marriage registered in Washington.\"[260]\nDuring Rachel Levine's confirmation hearing with the Senate HELP Committee to be Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Biden, Paul compared transgender medicine to \"genital mutilation\" and accused her of supporting \"surgical destruction of a minor's genitalia.\" Paul was rebuked by committee chairman Patty Murray, as well as multiple House and Senate Democrats, who were to vote on the Equality Act that same day.[261][262]\n\nForeign policy\nPaul being interviewed by Jerry Doyle at Liberty Political Action Conference (LPAC) 2011 in Reno, Nevada, September 16, 2011\nUnlike his more stridently \"non-interventionist\" father, Paul concedes a role for American armed forces abroad, including permanent foreign military bases.[263] He has said that he blames supporters of the Iraq War and not President Obama for the growth in violence that occurred in 2014, and that the Iraq War \"emboldened\" Iran.[264] Dick Cheney, John McCain and Rick Perry responded by calling Paul an isolationist,[265][266] but Paul has pointed to opinion polls of likely GOP primary voters as support for his position.[267] In 2011, shortly after being elected, Paul proposed a budget which specified $542 billion in defense spending. In 2015, he called for a defense budget of $697 billion.[268]\nReferring to ISIS, Paul stated: \"I personally believe that this group would not be in Iraq and would not be as powerful had we not been supplying their allies in the war [against Syrian Bashar al-Assad's government].\"[269] Paul then supported airstrikes against ISIS, but questioned the constitutionality of Obama's unilateral actions without a clear congressional mandate.[270][271] Paul has stated concerns about arms sent to Syrian rebels that wind up in unfriendly hands.[272] In December 2018 he supported President Trump's decision to pull the US army out from the Syrian Civil war.[273]\nIn 2016, Paul was one of the first members of Congress to come out in opposition to United States support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.[274] In June 2017, Paul tried to block Trump administration's plan to sell more weapons to Saudi Arabia.[275] In April 2018, he again criticized the U.S.-Saudi Arabia alliance, highlighting that \"Saudi Arabia has funded radical madrassas, teaching hatred of America throughout the world, and that Saudi Arabia also supplied arms to ISIS in the Syrian civil war.\"[276] Paul said that U.S.-backed Saudi blockade of Yemen has further aggravated the humanitarian crisis in the country.[276]\nPaul, like his father, has also been a critic of neoconservatism,[277] and urged Trump not to choose prominent neoconservative Elliott Abrams to serve as Deputy Secretary of State.[278] In April 2018, Paul voted for the confirmation of Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State.[279] Paul had previously insisted that he would not confirm Pompeo, citing Pompeo's hawkish foreign policy beliefs.[280]\nIn June 2019, Paul criticized the Trump administration for escalating tensions with Iran. Said Paul: \"One of the things I like about President Trump is that he said the Iraq War was a mistake. I think an Iran war would be even a bigger mistake than the Iraq War.\"[281][282] In January 2020 he criticized the U.S. airstrike on Baghdad International Airport which killed high-level Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. Paul stated that the attack will increase tensions between the two countries.[283]\nOn June 12, 2017, U.S. senators reached an agreement on legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia and Iran. The bill was opposed only by Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders.[284] In July 2018, shortly after 12 Russian intelligence officers have been charged with hacking and leaking emails of senior Democrats, he described the Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election as a \"witch hunt on the president\".[285] That same month, Paul blocked a Senate resolution that backed the intelligence community's assessment of Russian election interference and that called on President Trump to speak with special counsel Robert Mueller.[286] In August 2018 Paul traveled to Moscow and met with several Russian senators, including Sergey Kislyak. In May 2019, Paul opposed the decision of the Senate Intelligence committee, chaired by Republican Senator Richard Burr, to subpoena Donald Trump Jr., a close friend of Paul's, to testify in front of Congress about his involvement with Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.[287] In July 2018, Paul was among only two senators to vote against a Senate motion supporting NATO.[288]\nOn July 1, 2020, the Senate rejected Paul's amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act which would have required the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Afghanistan within a year and brought an end to the 19-year war.[289]\nOn May 12, 2022, Paul stopped a vote on a $40 billion spending bill for aid to Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion, objecting that it would be the second spending bill for this purpose, and that it was 3 times larger than the first.[290] Paul has also stated that President Biden provoked Russia by advocating for Ukraine's entrance into NATO.[291] In July, the Security Service of Ukraine placed Paul on a list of public figures whom it alleges promote Russian propaganda.[292]\nIn January 2024, Paul voted for a resolution, proposed by Bernie Sanders, to apply the human rights provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act to the Israel military assistance. The proposal was defeated 72 to 11.[293]\n\nCriminal justice issues\nPaul speaking with former U.S. congressman Allen West\nPaul has focused on criminal justice reform as a legislative priority.[294][295] He introduced the Justice Safety Valve Act in 2013 to provide judges with greater sentencing flexibility,[296] the Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act in 2014 to restore voting rights for non-violent felons,[297] the REDEEM Act in 2014 to allow sealing and expungement for non-violent crimes,[298] the FAIR Act in 2014 to rein in police use of civil asset forfeiture,[299] the RESET Act in 2014 to address the crack sentencing disparity and how drugs are weighed,[300] the Police CAMERA Act in 2015 to increase the use of body cameras by police,[301] the Stop Militarizing Our Law Enforcement Act in 2015 to reduce the use of military equipment by police,[302] the MERCY Act in 2015 to restrict the use of solitary confinement on juveniles,[303] the Pretrial Integrity and Safety Act in 2017 to encourage states to reform bail policies,[304] the Pregnant Women in Custody Act in 2018 to protect the health and safety of pregnant women in prison,[305] and the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act in 2020 to end the use of no-knock warrants.[306] Paul says policies such as the war on drugs and mandatory minimum sentencing have particularly harmed minorities.[307][308]\nIn 2020, Paul held up bipartisan legislation that would make lynching a federal crime.[309] Paul said that he thought lynching should be \"universally condemned\", but wanted an amendment to clarify that the causation of non-fatal injuries would not be considered lynching.[310]\nPaul was one of six Republican senators to vote no on expanding the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would allow the U.S. Justice Department to review hate crimes related to COVID-19 and establish an online database.[311][312]\nOn May 28, 2021, Paul voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[313]\nPaul supported the First Step Act.[314]\n\nDrug policy reform\nOn cannabis legalization, Paul says the issue should be left up to the states and that \"you ought to be able to pretty much do what you want to do as long as you don't hurt somebody else\".[315][316] Regarding medical use, Paul has endorsed efforts to legalize in Kentucky[317] and introduced the CARERS Act in 2015 to legalize medical cannabis at the federal level.[318] Paul has also supported states' rights-focused cannabis legislation, introducing the Rohrabacher\u2013Farr amendment in 2014,[319] cosponsoring the STATES Act in 2018,[320] and introducing other amendments.[321][322] Paul introduced the Marijuana Businesses Access to Banking Act in 2015 to allow cannabis businesses increased access to banks.[323]\nRegarding industrial hemp cultivation, Paul has supported efforts to legalize in Kentucky[324][325] and at the federal level as well, introducing the Industrial Hemp Farming Act in 2013.[326] In 2020 he introduced the Hemp Economic Mobilization Plan (HEMP) Act to increase the THC limit of hemp from 0.3% to 1%.[327][328]\nIn 2022, Paul introduced the Right to Try Clarification Act to clarify that the Right to Try Act allows terminally ill patients to use Schedule I drugs for which a Phase I clinical trial has been completed.[329] Also in 2022, he introduced the Breakthrough Therapies Act to allow Schedule I drugs such as psilocybin and MDMA to be rescheduled when they are designated as breakthrough therapies by the Food and Drug Administration.[330]\n\nGovernment surveillance\nPaul in New Hampshire, August 13, 2015\nAs a critic of warrantless surveillance of Americans, Paul says \"the Fourth Amendment is equally as important as the Second Amendment\" and has called for conservatives to more strongly defend Fourth Amendment rights.[331][332] In 2015 Paul spoke for ten and a half hours on the Senate floor against renewing provisions of the PATRIOT Act that he said were unconstitutional.[333][334] Paul has called Edward Snowden a \"whistleblower\" and called for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to resign for \"lying\" about the phone metadata program that Snowden exposed.[335][336] He also filed a class action lawsuit against the Obama administration seeking to end the program.[337] Paul gave a speech at the University of California, Berkeley in 2014 titled \"The N.S.A. vs. Your Privacy\".[338][339]\n\nClimate change\nPaul has not definitively accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, which has found that global warming is real, progressing, and primarily caused by humans. Paul has said pollution emissions are subject to \"onerous regulation.\"[340][341] In 2018, Paul called for an investigation of a National Science Foundation grant that went towards educating meteorologists about the science of climate change. Paul said the grant was \"not science\" but \"propagandizing\".[342] In a January 2020 tweet, Paul wrote, \"Despite climate alarmist predictions, humans will likely survive for hundreds of millions of years into the future. In the meantime, we should begin creating atmospheres on suitable moons or planets.\"[343]\n\nDisease control\nPaul has spread false claims about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.[344][345] In 2009, Paul was interviewed by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and suggested mandatory vaccination would be akin to martial law.[346] On February 2, 2015, he told conservative radio host Laura Ingraham regarding vaccinations, that \"most of them ought be voluntary\".[347] His remarks generated controversy by suggesting that states should not require parents to vaccinate their children, because parents should have the freedom to make that decision for their children. Later that day, in an interview with CNBC, Paul clarified this statement, saying, \"I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children, and it is an issue of freedom.\"[348] Afterward, he added about vaccines, \"I've heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.\"[349] On February 3, he posted a photograph to Twitter of himself being vaccinated.[350]\nIn 2014, Paul argued that the Obama administration and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were downplaying the threat posed by Ebola virus in the United States. Ultimately, nine people infected with Ebola returned to the United States, two nurses contracted the disease within the US, and two of the returning travelers died.[351]\nIn May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Paul said that stay-at-home orders amounted to \"dictatorship\" by Kentucky's Democratic governor Andy Beshear.[352]\nAt a Senate committee hearing on September 23, 2020, Paul clashed with Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.[353][354] Paul asked Fauci if he had \"second thoughts\" about the CDC's mitigation recommendations, including mask-wearing and maintaining a six-foot space of social distancing.[355] Paul said New York's high fatality rate showed that mitigation efforts were insufficient.[356] Fauci replied, \"You've misconstrued that Senator, and you've done that repetitively in the past\", saying that New York had succeeded in getting the virus under control by adhering to the CDC's clinical guidelines.[357]\nIn May 2021, during President Biden's push to convince more Americans to be vaccinated, Paul said he personally was choosing not to get the COVID vaccine, justifying his decision by saying that \"I've already had the disease and I have natural immunity\" and that \"in a free country\u00a0... each individual would get to make the medical decision.\"[358] Paul later challenged Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on the Biden administration's vaccine mandates by arguing that they are not needed for people who have been previously infected.[359]\nAt Senate hearings in May and July 2021, Paul debated Anthony Fauci on the origin of COVID-19, gaining media attention for his concerns about the risks of lab work.[360] In July 2021, Fauci responded to Paul's allegations and called him a liar.[361] In August 2021, Paul was suspended from YouTube for a week under the company's misinformation policy after he published a video with false claims that masks are not effective.[362][363][364] Paul also released a video of himself calling on people to \"resist\" public health measures to halt the spread of COVID-19.[365]\nOn August 11, 2021, Rand Paul disclosed that his wife Kelley Paul had purchased a stake in Gilead Sciences, which manufactures an antiviral drug used to treat COVID-19, on February 26, 2020.[366]\nOn October 10, 2023, Paul published Deception: The Great Covid Cover-Up with publisher Regnery Publishing.[367]\n\nHealth care\nPaul supports repealing the Affordable Care Act[368] and opposes universal health care, having once equated it to slavery.[369] Paul says he instead favors expanding health savings accounts and providing a $5000 tax credit, allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines, and allowing individuals and small businesses to pool together to purchase insurance. His plan would provide a two-year window during which people with pre-existing conditions could not be denied coverage.[370][371][372]\n\nTerm limits\nIn November 2019, Paul signed a pledge to support a constitutional amendment to limit senators to two terms.[373] In 2022, he was elected for his third term in the U.S. Senate;[374] in announcing his run for reelection he said: \"I am a fan of term limits. It would take a constitutional amendment, and the term limits would then be for everyone. But I'm not in favor of term limits for some and not others, so I'm not in favor of people self-imposing term limits. I'm a co-sponsor of the constitutional amendment, but I will run again in 2022.\"[375]\n\nEconomic issues\nPaul supports a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. constitution which would require Congress to balance the budget annually.[376] He has introduced legislation called the Penny Plan which would reduce federal spending by 1% each year, seeking to balance the budget in 5 years.[377] Paul has opposed efforts to raise the debt ceiling without significant spending cuts.[378]\nWhile running for president in 2016, Paul proposed the \"Fair and Flat Tax\" plan which he said would \"repeal the entire IRS tax code ... and replace it with a low, broad-based tax of 14.5 [percent] on individuals and businesses\".[379]\nPaul has introduced legislation to audit the Federal Reserve, saying that \"We must take a critical look at the Fed's monetary policy decisions, discount window operations, and a host of other things, with a real audit\u2014and not just pay lip-service to the idea of an audit.\"[380]\n\nPersonal life\nPaul with his family on the Capitol steps\nPaul and his father Ron Paul at an event hosted in their honor at CPAC 2011 in Washington, D.C.\nPaul is married to Kelley Paul (n\u00e9e Ashby), a freelance writer. They were married on October 20, 1990, and have three sons, William (born 1992), Duncan, and Robert. William and Duncan attended the University of Kentucky, while Robert attended a private school in the Washington, D.C. area.[381] They reside in Bowling Green, Kentucky.[382] They were previously active members of the Presbyterian church,[383] although more recently have attended a United Methodist church.[384]\n\n2017 assault\nOn November 3, 2017, Paul was assaulted by a neighbor, Rene Boucher (then aged 59), a retired anesthesiologist. Paul, who is deaf in one ear,[385] was wearing noise-canceling headphones while mowing his lawn, reportedly enabling Boucher to tackle Paul without his own approach being noticed.[386]\nBoucher was arrested and charged with one count of fourth-degree assault and released on a $7,500 bond. Paul sustained five broken ribs, of which three were displaced fractures.[387][388] In August 2019, part of Paul's lung required removal as a result of the injuries he suffered during the attack.[389]\nBoucher's attorney, Matthew Baker, described it as \"a very regrettable dispute between two neighbors over a matter that most people would regard as trivial\".[388][390] According to a memorandum filed by Baker the dispute was over Paul repeatedly leaving tree yard debris near his property line with his neighbor.[391] Rand Paul and his wife deny this; they claim that the \"media\" have \"misrepresented\" this \"from the beginning\" and that the attack was \"politically motivated.\" They claim that Boucher had threatened Donald Trump earlier and that he was \"a vocal hater\" of Trump and the GOP.[392]\nBoucher was originally charged in Kentucky state court,[393] but was later charged in federal court, where he ultimately pleaded guilty to assaulting a member of Congress.[394] The state-court charge was dismissed after Boucher pleaded guilty to the federal charge.[394] Boucher was initially sentenced to 30 days in prison, one year of probation, 100 hours of community service, and a $10,000 fine. The federal prosecutors had sought a 21-month term and appealed the lenient sentence.[394]\nIn September 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated Boucher's sentence of 30 days, ruling it was unreasonably short, indicating \"closer review\" was in order, and the case was sent back to the lower court for resentencing.[395] An appeal to the Supreme Court was denied.[396] At his resentencing, Boucher received a prison term of eight months, plus another six months of home confinement, and was given credit for the 30 days he had previously served. Prosecutors felt the downward departure from their request for a 21-month sentence was too great, but the judge said Boucher's eight years in the military, being forced to sell his home to pay a $580,000 judgment assessed by the state court against him in the civil case brought by Paul, and his completed community service mitigated against any additional prison time. Boucher expressed his regrets and contrition for his attack.[397]\n\n2020 COVID-19 diagnosis\nPaul announced on March 22, 2020, that he had tested positive for COVID-19 amid the ongoing pandemic of the disease. He was the first member of the United States Senate to test positive.[398][399] Paul received bipartisan criticism from his Senate colleagues after it was discovered that he attended Senate lunches and used the Senate gym while awaiting his test results; he defended his actions because he had no symptoms of the illness and believed it was \"highly unlikely\" he was sick.[400] On April 7, 2020, Paul announced his recovery.[401]\n\n2020 RNC confrontation\nIn August 2020, immediately following his attendance at the keynote speech delivered by President Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican National Convention held at the White House, Paul was confronted by protestors on his way to a hotel with his wife. A police perimeter was formed that escorted the Pauls away from the crowd, with one of the escorting officers being pushed in the process. The protestors' main contention point with Paul was the shooting of Breonna Taylor and their demands for Paul to \"say her name\". However, as was pointed out by several media organizations in the aftermath of the incident, Paul had previously authored a bill named after Taylor aiming to make no-knock warrants illegal.[402][403][404]\n\nElectoral history\n\n2010 United States Senate election in Kentucky\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\u00b1%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nRand Paul \n\n755,411 \n\n55.69% \n\n+5.03% \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nJack Conway\n\n599,617\n\n44.26%\n\n-5.12%\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n1,354,833 \n\n100.0% \n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nRepublican hold\n\n\n\n2016 United States Senate election in Kentucky[405]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\u00b1%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nRand Paul (incumbent) \n\n1,090,177 \n\n57.27% \n\n+1.58% \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nJim Gray\n\n813,246\n\n42.73%\n\n-1.53%\n\n\n\n\nWrite-in\n\n42\n\n0.00%\n\nN/A\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n1,903,465 \n\n100.0% \n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nRepublican hold\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Kentucky\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\u00b1%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nRand Paul (incumbent) \n\n913,257 \n\n61.81% \n\n+4.54% \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nCharles Booker\n\n564,231\n\n38.18%\n\n-4.55%\n\n\n\n\nIndependent\n\nCharles Lee Thomason\n\n110\n\n0.01%\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nIndependent\n\nBilly Ray Wilson\n\n24\n\n0.00%\n\nN/A\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n1,477,622 \n\n100.0% \n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nRepublican hold\n\n\nPrimary elections\n\n2010 United States Senate Republican primary in Kentucky[406]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nRand Paul \n\n206,986 \n\n58.8% \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nTrey Grayson\n\n124,864\n\n35.4%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nBill Johnson\n\n7,861\n\n2.2%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nJohn Stephenson\n\n6,885\n\n2.0%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nGurley L.
