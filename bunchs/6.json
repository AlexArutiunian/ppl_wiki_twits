Before entering politics, Donalds worked in the finance, insurance, and banking industries.[2]  Donalds represented the 80th district in the Florida House of Representatives from 2016 to 2020.[5][6][7]\nDonalds was elected to Congress in 2020, defeating Democratic nominee Cindy Banyai. In the January 2023 Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives election, Donalds received enough Republican votes to deny Kevin McCarthy the speakership in the fourth through 11th rounds of voting.[8] Donalds was a candidate in the third nomination for the October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election.[9]\nIdeologically positioned on the hard right flank of the Republican Party, he was a member of the Tea Party movement and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012. In January 2021, Donalds voted to object to the certification of electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania in the 2020 presidential election.[10] Donalds has repeatedly claimed that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president of the United States.[11]\n\n\nEarly life and education\nDonalds was born and raised in the Crown Heights neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[12][13] One of three children, he was raised by his single mother.[12] In 1996, Donalds graduated from Nazareth Regional High School in East Flatbush.[14] He attended Florida A&M University and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance and marketing from Florida State University in 2002.[12][15]\nIn 1997, Donalds was arrested for marijuana distribution; the charges were dropped as part of a pre-trial diversion program. In 2000, he pleaded no contest to a felony bribery charge as part of a scheme to defraud a bank. His record was later sealed and expunged.[16][17][18]\n\nCareer\nDonalds and President Donald Trump in 2019 with a former inmate freed by the First Step Act\nDonalds began his professional career in 2003 as a credit analyst at TIB Bank. He was promoted to senior credit analyst in 2004, and later promoted to commercial credit manager, assistant vice president, and credit manager. Donalds left TIB Bank in 2007 and took a position as a portfolio manager at CMG Surety LLC. In 2015, he joined Wells Fargo Advisors as a Financial Advisor.[19]\nAfter Donalds became involved in the Tea Party movement, he was encouraged to run for office.[12]\nIn 2012, Donalds was a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in Florida's 19th congressional district. He finished fifth of six candidates.[20] In 2014, he was reported as a likely candidate for the U.S. House in Florida's 19th congressional district after Trey Radel resigned, but did not run.[20]\nDonalds was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2016. During his Florida House tenure, he chaired the Insurance and Banking Subcommittee.[21]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nElections\n2020\nMain article: 2020 United States House of Representatives elections in Florida \u00a7\u00a0District 19\nDonalds being sworn in by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\nDonalds was the Republican nominee for Florida's 19th congressional district in the 2020 election, running to succeed retiring incumbent Francis Rooney. He won a crowded nine-way Republican primary by 770 votes over State Representative Dane Eagle, finishing just over the threshold to avoid a recount.[22][23] Republicans have a 550,000-voter advantage over Democrats in registration, and Florida Gulf Coast University professor Peter Bergerson noted that the Republican primary is almost always the real contest for most races in the area.[22][24] In August 2020, anonymous text messages were sent out to constituents in the 19th district claiming that Donalds was dropping out of the race. Donalds later clarified via tweet that he was not dropping out and called the messages \"illegal\".[25][26]\nDuring his campaign, Donalds described himself as a \"Trump supporting, gun owning, liberty loving, pro-life, politically incorrect Black man.\"[27] He stated his support for economic freedom, clean water, nuclear power and decreased government involvement in health care. He opposed the Green New Deal.[12]\nIn the November general election, Donalds defeated Democratic nominee Cindy Banyai. Donalds said he would focus on policy related to water quality in Southwest Florida.[28] Upon his swearing-in on January 3, 2021, Donalds became the sixth person to represent this district since its creation in 1983 (it had been the 13th District from 1983 to 1993, the 14th from 1993 to 2013, and has been the 19th since 2013).\n\nTenure in Congress\nIn late 2020, Donalds was identified as a participant in the \"Freedom Force\", a group of incoming House Republicans who \"say they\u2019re fighting against socialism in America\".[29][30][31] The following year Donalds was blocked from joining the Congressional Black Caucus.[32][33]\n\n2020 Election\nIn January 2021, Donalds voted to object to the certification of electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania in the 2020 presidential election.[34] Donalds has since claimed that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president of the United States, a claim he repeated in a Vanity Fair interview in July 2023.[11]\n\nIraq\nIn June 2021, Donalds was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.[35][36]\n\nSyria\nIn 2023, Donalds was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.[37][38]\n\nJanuary 2023 Speaker of the House election\nMain article: January 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election\nOn January 3, 2023, Donalds received one vote in the 118th Congress's first election for Speaker of the House, from Chip Roy.[39] Donalds voted for Kevin McCarthy on the first two ballots, then for Jim Jordan on the third.[40] On January 4, on the fourth ballot, Roy nominated Donalds for Speaker, and he received 20 votes.[39] This marked the first time two Black lawmakers were nominated for Speaker.[41] He was nominated by Lauren Boebert on the fifth ballot, and again received 20 votes.[42] He was sequentially nominated by Scott Perry,[43] Dan Bishop, Andy Biggs, Matt Rosendale, and Anna Paulina Luna on the sixth to tenth ballots. He was not nominated on the 11th ballot, but still received 12 votes. Donalds switched[44] his vote back to McCarthy after House Republican leadership made many concessions to House Freedom Caucus members.\n\nOctober 2023 candidacy for Speaker\nMain article: October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election\nDonalds was a candidate for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in the October 2023 election.[45]\n\nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023\nDonalds was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.[46]\n\nIsrael\nDonalds voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.[47][48]\n\nCommittee assignments\nFor the 118th Congress:[49]\n\nCommittee on Financial Services\nSubcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion\nSubcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy\nCommittee on Oversight and Accountability\nSubcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs\nSubcommittee on Government Operations and the Federal Workforce\nCaucus memberships\nFreedom Caucus[50]\nRepublican Study Committee[51]\nElectoral history\n2016\n\n2016 Florida's 80th State House district Republican primary[52]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nByron Donalds \n\n9,115 \n\n64.4% \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nJoe Davidow\n\n5,041\n\n35.6%\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n14,156 \n\n100.0 \n\n\n\n2016 Florida's 80th State House district general election[10]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nByron Donalds \n\n51,031 \n\n100.0% \n\n\n\n\nIndependent\n\nAnthony Joseph Cetrangelo (write-in)\n\n7\n\n0.0%\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n51,038 \n\n100.0 \n\n\n2018\n\n2018 Florida's 80th State House district general election[10]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nByron Donalds \n\n37,881 \n\n62.1% \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nJennifer Boddicker\n\n22,207\n\n36.4%\n\n\n\n\nIndependent\n\nDustin Alexander Lapolla\n\n931\n\n1.5%\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n61,019 \n\n100.0 \n\n\n2020\n\n2020 Florida's 19th congressional district Republican primary results[53]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nByron Donalds \n\n23,492 \n\n22.6% \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDane Eagle\n\n22,715\n\n21.9%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nCasey Askar\n\n20,774\n\n20.0%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nWilliam Figlesthaler\n\n19,075\n\n18.3%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nRandy Henderson\n\n7,858\n\n7.6%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nChristy McLaughlin\n\n4,245\n\n4.1%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDan Severson\n\n3,197\n\n3.1%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDarren Aquino\n\n1,466\n\n1.4%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nDaniel Kowal\n\n1,135\n\n1.1%\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n103,957 \n\n100.0% \n\n\n\n2020 Florida's 19th congressional district general election[54]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nByron Donalds \n\n272,440 \n\n61.27% \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nCindy Banyai\n\n172,146\n\n38.72%\n\n\n\n\nIndependent\n\nPatrick Post (write-in)\n\n3\n\n0.01%\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n444,589 \n\n100.0 \n\n\n2022\n\n2022 Florida's 19th congressional district Republican primary results\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nByron Donalds \n\n76,192 \n\n83.7 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nJim Huff\n\n14,795\n\n16.3\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n90,987 \n\n100.0 \n\n\n\n2022 Florida's 19th congressional district general election\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nByron Donalds \n\n213,035 \n\n68.01% \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nCindy Banyai\n\n100,226\n\n31.99%\n\n\n\n\nIndependent\n\nPatrick Post (write-in)\n\n13\n\n0%\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n313,274 \n\n100.0% \n\n\nPersonal life\nDonalds and his wife, Erika, have three sons.

He was previously a White House correspondent for National Review. He is also a syndicated columnist. Before working for National Review, York was a news producer at CNN Headline News and an investigative reporter for The American Spectator.\nHe has also written for The Atlantic, The Hill, The Wall Street Journal, The Weekly Standard, and the New York Post. He has appeared on such programs as Meet the Press, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, The O'Reilly Factor, Meet the Press, Special Report, The Laura Ingraham Show, and Hardball with Chris Matthews, and has contributed occasional commentaries to National Public Radio. For a brief period in 2005 he was a contributing blogger at The Huffington Post. He has taken part in discussions with other media personalities at BloggingHeads.tv.\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nIn 2001, York criticized President Bill Clinton's pardon of Susan McDougal, who had served three months in prison for Contempt of court related to her involvement in the Whitewater scandal.[2]\nIn 2005, York posited a plot by the Democratic Party to \"take down\" President George W. Bush in his book The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy.\nIn 2007, York called on President Bush to give a full pardon to Scooter Libby, who was sentenced to prison for obstruction of justice, perjury and making false statements in the Plame affair.[3]\nIn 2010, York wrote an op-ed titled \"Obama has himself to blame for Muslim problem\", which argued that President Obama was to blame for the widespread misconception that he was Muslim. York wrote that Obama had written about his Muslim grandfather and noted that members of his extended family were Muslim. York said that the Obama campaign had \"shouted down even a measured discussion of the topic\", and \"to the outside observer, Obama sometimes doesn\u2019t appear to practice any faith at all. Put it all together, and is it any wonder the public is confused?\"[4][5][6][7]\nAccording to the Toronto Star, York has \"[led] the inquiries into the alleged deep-state conspiracy against Trump\".[8] According to Slate, York has \"[spread] conspiracy theories about the FBI.\"[9] York suggested that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election could be compromised because of an alleged friendship to former FBI Director James Comey, whom President Trump fired.[10][11] York supported Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham's recommendation of criminal charges against Christopher Steele, one of the people who sought to expose Russian interference in the 2016 election. They alleged that Steele had lied to federal authorities. However, federal authorities have not filed charges against him for lying.[12] In July 2018, when Maria Butina, an accused Russian spy who had sought to involve herself in the NRA and the Republican Party, was arrested, York downplayed the charges.[13]\nIn February 2019, York argued that the attempt by the new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives to compel the release of President Trump's tax returns amounted to the \"ultimate fishing expedition\".[14]\nIn 2020, during the George Floyd protests against racism and police brutality, York criticized a statement by former President George W. Bush which said it was \"time for America to examine our tragic failures.\" York said it was \"remarkable\" that Bush \"almost completely ignored riots, violence.\"[15]\nShortly before the 2020 presidential election, York wrote a piece in the Washington Examiner analyzing a findings simulation that claimed Joe Biden wouldn't concede the election if he lost, and  claiming that Biden would pressure Democratic governors to reject Trump's victory in their states and that House Democrats would refuse to acknowledge Trump's victory. He also asserted that Trump would concede if he lost.[16] However, in reality, the opposite occurred. Trump lost the election, refused to concede, and pressured Republican governors to reject the results, all while numerous Republican officials, including in the House of Representatives, refused to acknowledge Biden's victory and voted to reject the electors.\n\nFamily and personal life[edit]\nHe is the son of Tom York, a longtime television personality from Birmingham, Alabama, and Helen Hamilton (born 1929). His nephew is Washington Examiner's Life and Arts editor, Park MacDougald. He is married, and plays the guitar and the mandolin.[17]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nThe Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: The Untold Story of How Democratic Operatives, Eccentric Billionaires, Liberal Activists, and Assorted Celebrities Tried to Bring Down a President\u2014and Why They'll Try Even Harder Next Time (NY, Crown Forum, 2005) ISBN\u00a01-4000-8238-2[18]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Zeleny, Jeff; Parker, Ashley (August 11, 2011). \"8 Republican Candidates Trade Attacks in Iowa Debate\".

He attended the American University for his undergraduate education.\n\nCareer[edit]\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s he worked as a reporter at NBC News. During a hiatus in his undergraduate education, he joined the U.S. Army, and served at the Armed Forces Radio in New York.[3] His program on CNBC was nominated for a CableACE Award in 1995.[4] His column, which began in 1984, is syndicated by Tribune Content Agency.[5] Thomas joined Fox News as a political contributor in 1997.

He also gives a daily radio commentary, syndicated by Salem Radio Network.\nFrom 2005 until the end of 2015, Thomas had been a columnist for USA Today, where he wrote articles with friend and political opposite, Bob Beckel, in the style of \"point\u2013counterpoint\".[6]\nThomas has written extensively about political issues and he supports, among other things, many American positions related to Israel.\nHe has written 10 books, including Blinded By Might, that discussed, among other things, the role of the Moral Majority in American politics of the 1980s. Thomas was vice president of the Moral Majority from 1980 to 1985. Thomas is an evangelical Christian,[7][8] and a member of Fourth Presbyterian Church in Bethesda, Maryland, affiliated with the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.[9]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nIranian nuclear negotiations[edit]\nIn a 2014 Washington Times article, Thomas claims, \"Iranian nuclear negotiators joined with Holocaust deniers, 9/11 truthers and anti-Semites from across the globe.\"[10]\n\nBarack Obama[edit]\nIn 2014, Thomas criticized the U.S. President Barack Obama for \"treating Israel as an enemy\".[10]\n\nIslam[edit]\nIn his article \"Mumbai Explained\", syndicated in December 2008, Thomas wrote that \"no new [mosques] should be built\" in Western countries following the Mumbai terrorist attacks. He further claimed that Muslim immigration posed a danger to the UK and United States.[11]\nFollowing the June 2016 massacre at the Pulse gay nightclub by ISIS sympathizer Omar Mateen, Thomas called for a moratorium on construction of mosques in the United States until \"radical Islamist ideology\" could be \"defeated\".[12]\n\nIsrael[edit]\nIn a 2023 column, Thomas affirmed his support for Israel and the Zionist movement.[13]\n\nLGBT rights[edit]\nAfter Bill Clinton became the first sitting United States president to address a gay rights organization, the Human Rights Campaign,[14] Thomas published a column[15] in November 1997 opposing homosexuality, in which he said:\n\nGod designed norms for behavior that are in our best interests. When we act outside those norms\u2014such as for premarital sex, adultery, or homosexual sex\u2014we cause physical, emotional, and spiritual damage to ourselves and to our wider culture. The unpleasant consequences of divorce and sexually transmitted diseases are not the result of intolerant bigots seeking to denigrate others. They are the result of violating God's standards, which were made for our benefit.\u2014\u200aCal Thomas, \"Immutable Morals\"\nThomas published a similar column[16] on October 16, 2009, after Barack Obama became the second sitting United States president to address the Human Rights Campaign.[14] Thomas said:\n\nWe will get more of what we tolerate. Sexual behavior is an important cultural and moral issue. Mr. Obama won the election with just 52 percent of the popular vote and a margin of 7 percent over Sen. John McCain. This should not be seen as a mandate for him and his administration to make over America in a secular and liberal image. Neither should it be seen as an invitation to give blanket approval to homosexuality, considered by some to be against the best interests of the people who practice it as well as the nations that accept it.\u2014\u200aCal Thomas, \"Don't Ask, Tell or Legitimize\"\nPersonal life[edit]\nThomas was married to Charlotte Ray Thomas for 51 years until her death in 2017.[17] Thomas married CJ Berwick, a classmate from Walter Johnson High School, in 2018.[18] The couple reside in Key Largo, Florida as of 2020[update].[19]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Thomas on The Things That Matter Most, July 10, 1994, C-SPAN\n2020, America's Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires and Superpowers\u2026 and the Future of the United States (ISBN\u00a00-310-35753-5)\nThomas, Cal (2014).

In 2020 he was charged by federal prosecutors with cyberstalking and harassment, for which he was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2021. In February 2022, Kurson pleaded guilty to state misdemeanor criminal charges of attempted eavesdropping and computer trespass related to his divorce.[3]\n\n\nEducation and family[edit]\nKurson was the son of a traveling salesman of motorcycle parts, and once recounted that \"some years were good; others we had to sell our piano and all our furniture.\"[2] He graduated from Glenbrook North High School in Northbrook, Illinois, in 1986,[4] and is the younger brother of bestselling author Robert Kurson.[4] While he began studies at the University of Chicago, he left college, finding the experience to be \"soul-deadening.\"[2]\n\nCareer[edit]\nEarly career[edit]\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Kurson played bass for the Chicago punk rock band Green.[2][5] After leaving Green in 1990, Kurson founded The Lilacs with David Levinsky.[5]\nA debut EP, The Lilacs Love You, was produced by Material Issue frontman Jim Ellison, who is also credited with naming the band The Lilacs.[6] A follow-up EP, The Lilacs Hate You, was the band's next release.[7] A full-length CD, The Lilacs Rise Above the Filth, was produced by Brad Wood and released in 1992.[8]\nIn 1993, he headed to New York to break into journalism, and landed internships and jobs at Rolling Stone, Harper's and Worth. In 1995, he began an irreverent eight-page publication on financial topics, The Kenny Quarterly, while working as an editor at United Media. It was to friends desiring financial advice. Later that year, he and a friend, John Packel, turned The Kenny Quarterly into Green.[2] It was acquired by Bankrate in 1999.[9] Kurson was a contributing editor at Esquire from 1997 to 2001, covering investing.[10] Kurson first became interested in finance when he played bass for Green. He took charge of the band's books and contracts.[2]\nA New York Times profile in 2000 said that Kurson \"has made personal finance palatable for people who might otherwise believe that it belongs on the shelf with Geritol and Dentu-Creme.\"[2]\nDoubleday published Kurson's first book, The Green Magazine Guide to Personal Finance in April 1998.[11] He was co-author of a book with journalist David Faber published by Little, Brown in 2002.\n\nPolitical consulting[edit]\nFrom 2002 through the end of 2006, Kurson was Deputy Director of Communications for Giuliani Partners, the consulting company founded by Rudy Giuliani, with whom he had co-authored the book, Leadership. Kurson served as chief operating officer (COO) during Rudy Giuliani's unsuccessful 2008 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.[12]\nKurson hired by the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee and put in charge of the Mid-Atlantic Region \u2013 New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland.[citation needed] In May 2007, he was promoted to chief operating officer, reporting to Michael DuHaime,[citation needed] and served in this role until Giuliani withdrew from the race on January 30, 2008.[citation needed]\nAfter the campaign, Kurson worked at Jamestown Associates, a Republican political consulting firm based in New Jersey.[13]\nKurson ran in the 2003 New Jersey General Assembly election for the 34th Legislative District as a Republican. He received 17.6% of the vote and ran a distant third behind Democratic incumbent Peter C. Eagler (with 33.2%) and his running mate Sheila Oliver (31.0%).[14][15]\nIn 2010 he was the co-author of the personal memoir of biotechnology executive John Crowley entitled Chasing Miracles: The Crowley Family Journey of Strength, Hope and Joy.[16]\n\nNew York Observer[edit]\nIn January 2013, Kurson was named the editor of The New York Observer by the newspaper's publisher, Jared Kushner.[17] His tenure as editor marked by questions about his ties to Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and to the Trump campaign, especially after he acknowledged that he had worked on a Trump speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. After criticism, Kurson said that he would no longer advise the Trump campaign. As editor, Kurson oversaw the publication's decision in 2016 to end its print edition and drop \"New York\" from its title, in a break with its past under former editor Peter W. Kaplan.[18][19]\n\nLater career[edit]\nIn May 2017, Kurson stepped down from the Observer to work as a senior managing director at Teneo Strategies, a firm run by allies of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton.[18]\nHe was a board member of the payments company Ripple Labs from February 2017[20] until October 2020, when federal prosecutors charged him in federal court with interstate cyberstalking and related offenses.[21]\nIn 2018 he founded Sea of Reeds Media, a media company based in Washington, D.C. and is the CEO.[22] Sea of Reeds Media publishes Modern Consensus, California Globe, New Jersey Globe, Rock and Roll Globe, Wine and Whiskey Globe, Book and Film Globe, and Fine Art Globe.[23]\n\nCriminal indictments[edit]\nFederal harassment indictment[edit]\nIn March 2018, journalist Deborah Copaken wrote an article in The Atlantic in which she claimed that Kurson withdrew a job offer that had been made to her to write for the New York Observer after not responding favorably to sexual advances from him.[24][25] Kurson said he \"categorically denied any claim of inappropriate behavior.\"[19]\nIn May 2018, Kurson revealed he was under consideration for an unpaid position in the Trump Administration.[26][19][27] It later became known that he was considered for the board of the National Endowment for the Humanities.[27] In an FBI background check, agents interviewed Copaken in June 2018. She told the agents that she had been contacted by a female Mount Sinai Hospital physician who alleged in 2015 that Kurson had harassed her. The FBI contacted Mount Sinai and interviewed the doctor and other employees about Kurson.[27][28][25] When the list of appointees to the endowment was released in July 2018, Kurson was not on the list. He said at the time that he had withdrawn from consideration the previous month due to too much paperwork in the vetting process.[27]\nIn October 2020, federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint charging him with interstate cyberstalking and harassment of the doctor.[1] According to the federal prosecutors, Kurson used aliases to post a flood of negative Yelp reviews about the physician, sent her threatening emails, harassed her with anonymous calls, and delivered messages to other Mount Sinai employees claiming the physician was having an affair with her boss.[21] Mount Sinai Hospital was so concerned about the harassment at the time that it hired someone to protect the doctor for a few days.[27]\n\nPresidential pardon[edit]\nKurson was granted a full pardon by President Trump on January 19, 2021, the last full day of the Trump presidency. The White House said in a statement that Kurson's ex-wife wrote a \"powerful letter to the prosecutors\" on his behalf, saying that \"she never wanted this investigation or arrest,\" that the investigation only took place because of the vetting process, and that \"Kurson is an upstanding citizen and father to five beautiful children.\"[29]\nElizabeth Spiers, Kurson's predecessor at the Observer, noted in The Daily Beast that the White House statement did not mention the other alleged victims, and that the pardon stood out from the other persons pardoned \"because of the ongoing threat that some of the people he allegedly stalked and harassed fear that he may pose to them now.\" Copaken said she was \"terrified\" by the pardon.[30]\n\nNew York charges[edit]\nIn August 2021, Kurson was charged in a New York state court with hacking into his wife's computer between September 2015 and March 2016 as their marriage fell apart and they divorced. He was accused of using the spyware program WebWatcher to obtain access to her Facebook and Gmail accounts. [31] Kurson was also alleged to have anonymously distributed his wife's Facebook postings.[32]\nIn announcing the charges, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney from Manhattan, said, \"We will not accept presidential pardons as get-out-of-jail-free cards for the well-connected in New York.\"[33]\nIn February 2022, Kurson struck a plea deal with prosecutors, pleading guilty to two misdemeanors with the opportunity to have the charges further reduced. Under the terms of the deal, he must complete 100 hours of community service, and if not arrested for another crime, in one year he will withdraw those pleas, and plead to the lesser offense of second degree harassment.[3][31]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nKurson lives in Maplewood, New Jersey,[1] and is married to Melody Kurson.[34]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Individual Charged with Cyberstalking Three Victims\". www.justice.gov.

During the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war, she criticized the Church of Saint Porphyrius airstrike and accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinian people.[13][14] She has attracted criticism for disseminating conspiracy theories.[15]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBorn in White Plains, New York, Owens was raised with her siblings by her grandparents from around the age of 11 or 12, after her parents divorced. She is the third of four children.[16][17] She said her paternal grandfather Robert Owens, a black American, was born in North Carolina.[17] Owens is also of Caribbean American heritage through her grandmother who is originally from Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.[18] She is a graduate of Stamford High School.[19]\nIn 2007, while a 17-year-old senior in high school, Owens received three racist death threat voicemail messages, totaling two minutes, from a group of white male classmates.[20][21][22][23] Joshua Starr, the city's superintendent of schools, listened to the voicemail messages and said that they were \"horrendous\".[23] Owens's family sued the Stamford Board of Education in federal court, alleging that the city did not protect her rights, resulting in a $37,500 settlement in January 2008.[19][24]\nOwens pursued an undergraduate degree in journalism at the University of Rhode Island.[17] She dropped out after her junior year because of an issue with her student loan.[17] Afterwards, she worked as an intern for Vogue magazine in New York.[19][25] In 2012, Owens took a job as an administrative assistant for a private equity firm in Manhattan, later moving up to become its vice president of administration.[19]\n\nEarly career[edit]\nDegree180 and anti-conservative blog[edit]\nIn 2015, Owens was CEO of Degree180, a marketing agency that offered consultation, production, and planning services which included a blog on a variety of topics[17][5] written by Owens and other commentators.[26] In a 2015 column that Owens wrote for the site, she criticized conservative Republicans, writing about the \"bat-shit-crazy antics of the Republican Tea Party\"; she also added that \"The good news is, they will eventually die off (peacefully in their sleep, we hope), and then we can get right on with the OBVIOUS social change that needs to happen, IMMEDIATELY.\"[17][27][28][29] In 2016, the blog featured an article mocking Donald Trump's penis size.[5][30][31]\n\nPrivacy violation, Gamergate, and political transformation[edit]\nOwens launched SocialAutopsy.com in 2016, a website she said would expose bullies on the Internet by tracking their digital footprint.[17][27][19] The site would have solicited users to take screenshots of offensive posts and send them to the website, where they would be categorized by the user's name.[19] She used crowdfunding on Kickstarter for the website. The proposal was immediately controversial, drawing criticism that Owens was de-anonymizing (doxing) Internet users and violating their privacy.[17][32] According to The Daily Dot, \"People from all sides of the anti-harassment debate were quick to criticize the database, calling it a public shaming list that would encourage doxing and retaliatory harassment.\"[33] Both conservatives and progressives condemned the website.[17]\nIn response, people began posting Owens's private details online.[17] With scant evidence, Owens blamed the doxing on progressives.[17][32] Following that, she earned the support of conservatives involved in the Gamergate harassment campaign, including right-wing political commentators, such as Milo Yiannopoulos and Mike Cernovich.[17] Subsequently, Owens became a conservative, saying in 2017, \"I became a conservative overnight\u00a0... I realized that liberals were actually the racists. Liberals were actually the trolls\u00a0... Social Autopsy is why I'm conservative.\"[17] Kickstarter suspended funding for Social Autopsy, and the website was never created.[32]\n\nConservative activism[edit]\nThis article is part of a series onConservatismin the United States\nSchools\nCompassionate\nFiscal\nFusion\nLibertarian\nModerate\nMovement\nNeo\nPaleo\nProgressive\nSocial\nTraditionalist\n\n\nPrinciples\nAmerican exceptionalism\nAnti-communism\nChristian nationalism\nClassical liberalism\nConstitutionalism\nFamily values\nJudeo-Christian values\nLimited government\nMilitarism\nMoral absolutism\nNatural law\nPatriotism\nRepublicanism\nRight to bear arms\nRule of law\nTradition\n\n\nHistory\nConservative coalition\nConservative Democrat\nConservative Manifesto\nLoyalists\nMcCarthyism\nModern timeline\nNew Right\nOld Right\nOverview\nReagan Doctrine\nReaganomics\nStalwart Republicans\nSouthern Agrarians\n\n\nIntellectuals\nBabbitt\nBoorstin\nBozell Jr.\nBuchanan\nBuckley\nBurnham\nChambers\nDolan\nEliot\nGeorge\nGoldberg\nGottfried\nHanson\nHazony\nHoppe\nJaffa\nKirk\nKirkpatrick\nKreeft\nKristol (Bill)\nKristol (Irving)\nKuehnelt-Leddihn\nLaffer\nLasch\nLodge\nLovecraft\nLukacs\nMansfield\nMeese\nMeyer\nNisbet\nNock\nPodhoretz\nRansom\nSantayana\nSowell\nStrauss\nViereck\nVoegelin\nWashington\nWeaver\nWill\n\n\nPoliticians\nAbbott\nAdams\nQuincy Adams\nAgnew\nBuchanan\nBush (George H.

I'm moving to Nashville and joining the Daily Wire!! This was a tough secret to keep. I couldn't be more excited!!\"[42] Her podcast Candace premiered on the platform on March 19, 2021.[43] Its episodes are filmed in front of a live studio audience and air weekly. Notable guests include former United States president Donald Trump, UFC president Dana White, and U.S. Representative Jim Jordan. In February 2021, Owens tweeted that she was considering a run for president in 2024.[44]\n\nBLEXIT Foundation[edit]\n\"Blexit\", a term originally coined by Me'Lea Connelly, is a portmanteau of \"black\" and \"exit\" that mimics Brexit, the word used to describe the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. The original Blexit movement was started in 2016 by Connelly with the goal of achieving black economic independence by encouraging black Americans to leave the traditional financial systems that have historically disadvantaged the black community.[45][46][47]\nIn late 2018, Owens launched a different BLEXIT[a] foundation,[48][49] which featured a social media campaign to encourage ethnic minorities, including African Americans and Latinos, to leave the Democratic Party and register as Republicans. At the time, 8% of black Americans identified as Republicans.[16] In 2023, Blexit foundation merged with Turning Point USA, the former non-profit organization for which Owens had worked.[50]\nAt the launch in October 2018, Owens said that her \"dear friend and fellow superhero Kanye West\" designed merchandise for the movement; the following day, West denied being the designer and disavowed the effort, saying: \"I never wanted any association with Blexit ... I've been used to spread messages I don't believe in.\"[51][52][53] After an apology, West continued to support Owens as of September\u00a02020[update].[54]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nOwens speaking at the White House in 2019\nOwens said she had no interest in politics whatsoever before 2015 but previously identified as liberal.[55][56] In October 2018, she said that she had never voted and had only recently become a registered Republican.[56] In January 2019, Owens stated: \"The left hates America, and Trump loves it.\"[57] She added that the left is \"destroying everything through this cultural Marxist ideology.\"[57]\nThe Guardian has described Owens as \"ultra-conservative\",[58] and New York magazine and the Columbia Journalism Review have described her as \"right-wing\".[59][60] The Daily Beast has called her views \"far-right\", and the Pacific Standard called her a member of the \"alt-right\"; she has rejected both terms.[27][61][62][63] She was influenced by the works of Ann Coulter, Milo Yiannopoulos, Ben Carson, and Thomas Sowell.[64]\n\nForeign policy[edit]\nOwens is a critic of Israel and expressed her negative views of the country during the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war.[13]\nSpecifically, she criticized the Church of Saint Porphyrius airstrike, stating, \"If you think it's antisemitism to notice that innocent Christians were killed in an IDF bombing, then you need to log off.\" Which came after Palestinian officials claimed that 18 people were killed in the strike, with 17 of them identified as Christians.[65][66] In a subsequent tweet, Owens stated, \"No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever.\"[67][65] On November 14, 2023, a 32-second video clip of Ben Shapiro, co-founder of The Daily Wire\u2014 the organization for which Candace Owens works\u2014surfaced online. In the video, Shapiro responded to a question from a crowd regarding Owens' stance on the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war, stating, \"Candace Owens...I think her behavior during this has been disgraceful, without a doubt.\"[68]\nOwens has promoted a quote by Russian President Vladimir Putin,[69] which included the assertion that the USSR created the modern country of Ukraine. Her views have received support and amplification from the Embassy of Russia, Washington, D.C., particularly following her tweet stating \"Russian lives matter\" after the start of Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.[70][71] In March 2022, Owens faced criticism from historian Anne Applebaum for claiming that Ukraine \"wasn't a thing until 1989\" and dismissing the notion of a Russian-led genocide in the country, prompting Applebaum to label Owens as ignorant of history.[72] In December 2022, Owens faced backlash and fact-checking on social media after making unfounded claims about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's wife, with Twitter users debunking her allegations and highlighting the lack of evidence.[73]\n\nRace relations[edit]\nOwens is known for her criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement,[7][74][75][76] and has described Black Lives Matter protesters as \"a bunch of whiny toddlers, pretending to be oppressed for attention\".[77] Owens has argued that African Americans have a victim mentality, often referring to the Democratic Party as a \"plantation\",[74][58] stating in 2020: \"Black lives only matter to white liberals every four years\u2014ahead of an election.\"[78] She has also argued that the American Left likes \"black people to be government-dependent\",[79] and that black people have been brainwashed to vote for Democrats.[6] Furthermore, Owens has argued that police brutality in the United States and instances of police killing black people are not sourced in racism, but typically occur when the officer feels his life is under threat,[74][77] adding a police officer is eighteen-and-a-half times more likely to die at the hands of a black person than vice versa.[27][58][57] She has also characterized abortion as a tool for the extermination of black babies.[17]\nShe has said that \"black Americans are doing worse off economically today than we were doing in the 1950s under Jim Crow\", adding that this is because \"we've only been voting for one party since then.\"[57] She has attributed economic improvements for African Americans, such as a low unemployment rate, to Trump's presidency.[57] On several occasions, Owens has claimed that the effects of white supremacy and white nationalism are exaggerated and would not reach her own personal top 100 list of modern issues facing black America,[80] especially when compared to other issues facing black Americans, such as black-on-black crime and illiteracy rates.[81]\nWhen asked if it was problematic that white supremacist groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), support Trump, Owens answered that antifa was more prevalent than the KKK.[57] Owens has said that the media cover the KKK during Trump's presidency to hurt him.[82] In a 2019 hearing on hate crimes, Owens referred to the KKK as a \"Democrat terrorist organization\".[83] After the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Owens said that concern over rising white nationalism was \"stupid\".[17] She has also called it \"just election rhetoric\" and \"based on the hierarchy of what's impacting minority Americans, if I had to make a list of 100 things, white nationalism would not make the list.\"[84] In 2018, Owens dismissed reports of a resurgence in hate crimes, saying \"All of the violence this year primarily happened because of people on the left.\"\n\nOwens in 2019\nDuring her April 2019 testimony before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on the rise of hate crimes and white supremacists in the United States, Owens made the claim that the Southern strategy employed by the Republican Party to increase political support among white voters in the South by appealing to racism against African Americans was a \"myth\" that \"never happened\". This was disputed by several historians who said that the existence of the Southern strategy was well documented in contemporaneous sources dating back to the Civil Rights era, with historian Kevin M. Kruse, who writes critically about modern conservatism, calling Owens's statement \"utter nonsense\".[85]\nIn June 2019, Owens said that African Americans had it better in the first 100 years after the abolition of slavery in the United States than they have since,[86][87][88] and that socialism was at fault.[86] In June 2020, Owens claimed that George Soros paid people to protest the murder of George Floyd.[89] Shortly afterwards, she argued that George Floyd \"was not a good person. I don't care who wants to spin that.\"[90] She said: \"The fact that he has been held up as a martyr sickens me.\"[90] Then-President Trump retweeted Owens's remarks about Floyd.[90][91] In a Facebook video that garnered nearly 100 million views, Owens called Floyd a \"horrible human being\", citing his criminal record, and called racial biases among police a \"fake narrative.\"[92] On April 20, 2021, Owens claimed that the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who was convicted of murdering Floyd was \"mob justice\". She added: \"This was not a fair trial. No person can say this was a fair trial.\"[93]\nOn October 3, 2022, during Adidas Yeezy SZN 9 fashion show in Paris, Owens posed for a photo with Kanye West wearing a matching shirt with the \"WHITE LIVES MATTER\" slogan.[94] During Paris Fashion Week, West entered negotiations with Owens' husband, the CEO of social networking service Parler, to purchase the website.[95] After West posted tweets declaring he would \"go Death Con 3 on Jewish people\"; Owens defended West, stating that \"if you are an honest person, you did not find this tweet antisemitic\".[96] Owens further accused the Anti-Defamation League of instigating antisemitism following the organization's criticism of West and Kyrie Irving.[97] Owens's comments were made before West praised Adolf Hitler in an InfoWars interview. After the interview, Parler announced that West has canceled his plans to buy the website.[98] The Zionist Organization of America condemned Owens's defense of West, calling on her to \"retract her offensive, dangerous statements\".[99]\n\nWomen's rights[edit]\nOwens is critical of feminism[100] and embraces the \"trad wife\" phenomenon of traditional gender roles.[101] She has described the #MeToo movement, an international movement against sexual harassment and assault, as \"stupid\".[4][102] Owens wrote that the movement was premised on the idea that \"women are stupid, weak & inconsequential\".[4][102] She opposes abortion,[64] which she has called a tool for the \"extermination of black babies\".[17]\nIn May 2018, Owens suggested that \"something bio-chemically happens\" to women who do not marry or have children, and she linked to the Twitter handles of Sarah Silverman, Chelsea Handler, and Kathy Griffin, saying that they were \"evidentiary support\" of this theory.[103][104] Silverman responded: \"It seems to me that by tweeting this, you would like to maybe make us feel badly. I'd say this is evidenced by ur [sic] effort to use our twitter handles so we would see. My heart breaks for you, Candy. I hope you find happiness in whatever form that takes.\"[103] Owens responded, accusing Silverman of supporting terrorists and crime gangs.[103]\n\nLGBT rights[edit]\nOn July 28, 2017, Owens stated she was in favor of banning transgender individuals who are undergoing sex reassignment surgery from serving in the United States military but said that she did not oppose fully transitioned transgender individuals serving in the U.S. military.[105] In April 2022, she called The Walt Disney Company \"child groomers and pedophiles\" and called for the boycott of the company, after Disney announced its opposition to Florida House Bill 1557, officially known as the \"Parental Rights in Education Act\" but commonly referenced as the \"Don't Say Gay\" legislation.[106][107][108][109]\nIn May 2022, Owens falsely claimed on Twitter that the gunman involved in the Robb Elementary School shooting could be transgender and said that he was \"cross-dressing\".[110] According to Owens, this was evidence that \"there were plenty of signs that he was mentally disturbed\".[111] In June 2022, she described Drag Queen Story Hour as \"child abuse\", arguing that parents who take their children to a drag queen story hour \"are underqualified to have children\" and \"should have their children taken away from them.\"[112]\n\nWelfare[edit]\nOwens has expressed a critical stance on welfare programs, arguing that they can create dependency and discourage self-reliance among recipients. She believes that welfare reform is necessary to promote individual responsibility and empower individuals to break free from government assistance. Owens has said that welfare is a Democratic Party tool to keep black Americans dependent upon the government.[64]\n\nImmigration[edit]\nOwens is a proponent of the Mexico\u2013United States barrier, and believes undocumented immigrants to the United States should be immediately deported.[17] In 2018, Owens warned that \"Europe will fall and become a Muslim-majority continent by 2050. There has never been a Muslim-majority country where sharia law was not implemented.\" She suggested that the United States would then be \"forced to save\" the British.[113][114]\n\nDonald Trump[edit]\nOwens initially posted and allowed anti-Trump and anti-conservative articles on her blog.[5][30] In 2017, she began describing herself as a conservative Donald Trump supporter.[17][115][116] Owens has since characterized Trump as the \"savior\" of Western civilization.[7] She has argued that Trump has neither engaged in rhetoric that is harmful to African Americans, nor proposed policies that would harm African Americans.[27][58]\nIn May 2018, Trump said that Owens \"is having a big impact on politics in our country. She represents an ever-expanding group of very smart 'thinkers', and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on... so good for our Country!\"[117] She registered as a Republican in 2018, after the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination. She objected to what she termed the \"social lynching\" of Kavanaugh, on the grounds that to \"believe women\" was the reason \"our ancestors got lynched\", as she told a journalist from Philadelphia magazine. She added: \"No evidence, but believe all women.\"[118] After Joe Biden won the 2020 U.S. presidential election and Trump refused to concede, Owens promoted Trump's claims of mass fraud, saying that \"the American election was clearly rigged.\"[119] She endorsed Trump's opponent Vivek Ramaswamy in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries.[120]\n\nClimate change[edit]\nIn July 2018, Owens claimed that global warming is not real, calling it a lie used to \"extract dollars from Americans\".[121][122][123] In 2021, she promoted paid ads on Facebook, calling the U.S. government \"modern doomsayers\" who have been wrongly predicting climate crises for decades.[124][125]\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and vaccination[edit]\nIn April 2020, Owens said that COVID-19 deaths were overcounted; health experts said that it was more likely that COVID-19 deaths were undercounted.[126] Regarding a COVID-19 vaccine, she said in June 2020 that \"under no circumstances will I be getting any #coronavirus vaccine that becomes available. Ever. No matter what.\"[127] She also referred to Bill Gates as a \"vaccine-criminal\", and said that he and the World Health Organization (WHO) used \"African & Indian tribal children to experiment w/ non-FDA approved drug vaccines.\"[15][128] On August 8, 2021, Owens said in a Facebook post: \"I still have not received the COVID-19 vaccine and have not demanded that any of my employees get it either. I am proud that I committed myself to standing firm against the bribery, media propaganda, coercion, celebrity-peer pressure campaign, plus censorship... It is isn't easy to swim against such a polluted current but here I am. I trust my gut much more than trust Dr. Fauci.\"[129] Also in August, Owens claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proposed \"putting high risk people into camps to 'shield' low risk people from them\".[130]\nIn 2021, Owens attracted media attention when she stated that the United States should \"invade Australia\",[131][132][133][134] saying that Australia had turned into a tyrannical Nazi-style police state due to its public health precautions against COVID-19.[131][135] Owens said that the comments were made \"in jest\" and that they had been misinterpreted by the media.[136] Owens has promoted misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.[143] In a December 2021 interview, she asked Donald Trump about vaccine mandates, and he explained that he shared her views on mandates but said that \"the vaccine is one of the greatest achievements of mankind\". He added: \"The ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don't take the vaccine. But it's still their choice. And if you take the vaccine, you're protected. Look, the results of the vaccine are very good, and if you do get it, it's a very minor form. People aren't dying when they take the vaccine.\"[144][145][146] In December 2022, Owens promoted the anti-vaccine film Died Suddenly.[147]\n\nLegal issues[edit]\nDuring an Instagram livestream on June 22, 2021, Owens made accusations about former Republican congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik, accusing her of money laundering, tax fraud, illegal drug use, and misusing campaign funds. Owens also said that Klacik is a \"madame\" who recruits strippers for a strip club owned by her husband.[148][149][150][151] Owens said she found out about this after talking with a woman who claimed to have worked as a stripper at Klacik's strip club.[152]\nKlacik denied the allegations and repeatedly asked for Owens to take down the video, which she refused to do.[149][150] In July, Klacik filed a lawsuit against Owens seeking $20 million for defamation and claiming that the allegations have resulted in Klacik losing political support from donors, being removed from public events, a book deal cancellation, and harassment of Klacik and her family.[148][150][152] In a statement, Jacob S. Frenkel, Klacik's attorney, said: \"The defendant chose to use her huge social media platform to attack a respected Baltimore political figure\" and that \"We are using the proper forum \u2014 the power of the courts \u2014 to respond.\"[150][152] The suit was dismissed with prejudice in December 2022.[153]\nIn April 2022, a class-action lawsuit was filed in Florida against LGBcoin, a cryptocurrency company, Owens, stock car racing driver Brandon Brown, and NASCAR alleging that the defendants made false statements about the LGBcoin and that the founders of the company had engaged in a pump and dump scheme.[154]\n\nControversies[edit]\nDispute with family of Mollie Tibbetts[edit]\nIn August 2018, Owens had a dispute with Sam Lucas, cousin of Mollie Tibbetts, who had been murdered by Cristhian Bahena Rivera, a 24-year-old Mexican undocumented immigrant.[155] Tibbetts's cousin said that Owens had exploited Tibbetts's death for \"political propaganda\".[156][157] Owens responded by describing Lucas's criticism as a \"strange\" attack on Trump supporters. Later that month, the University of Iowa's chapter of Turning Point USA criticized Owens for \"public harassment\" towards a member of Tibbetts's family, and the executive board members of the chapter all resigned in protest.[158]\n\nPromotion of conspiracy theories[edit]\nOwens has been criticized for promoting conspiracy theories, including claims that the Moon landings were faked, mostly through her social media profiles and television and media appearances.[159] Owens has appeared on fringe conspiracy websites, such as InfoWars.[27][6] In 2018, she was a guest host on Fox News, and began to distance herself from the far-right conspiracy websites, although she refused to criticize InfoWars or its hosts.[17]\nDuring the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts targeting prominent Democrats, Owens took to Twitter to promote the conspiracy theory that the mailings were sent by leftists.[160] After authorities arrested a 56-year-old suspect who was a registered Republican and Trump supporter, Owens deleted her tweet without explanation.[161]\n\nComments about Adolf Hitler[edit]\nRepresentative Ted Lieu playing a recording of Owens's statements on Hitler and Owens responding to it\nAt the launch of the British offshoot Turning Point UK in December 2018, Owens made comments about Adolf Hitler.[162] She was responding to an audience member who asked for a \"long-term prognosis\" about the terms \"globalism\" and \"nationalism\". Owens said:[162][163]\n\nI actually don't have any problems at all with the word \"nationalism\". I think that the definition gets poisoned by elitists that actually want globalism. Globalism is what I don't want. Whenever we say \"nationalism\" the first thing people think about, at least in America, is Hitler. You know, [Hitler] was a national socialist, but if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, okay, fine. The problem is that he wanted\u2014he had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalize. He wanted everybody to be German, everybody to be speaking German. Everybody to look a different way. That's not, to me, that's not nationalism\nFollowing heavy criticism for her comments, Owens clarified them on Twitter and in a Judiciary Committee hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives in February 2019.[164] Owens said that \"[Hitler] was a homicidal, psychopathic, maniac that killed his own people\" and \"[Hitler] was not a nationalist, [he] murdered his own people; a nationalist would not kill their own people\". She said that the point of her comments was to say that there is \"no excuse or defense ever for\u00a0... everything that [Hitler] did\".[162][165] She also said that her comments were about Hitler's crimes against Jews.[164]\nOwens's comments about Hitler were played in April 2019 by Representative Ted Lieu during testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee about the issue of increasing hate crimes and white supremacy in America. Lieu said that he did not know Owens and was just going to let her own words characterize her, before playing the audio clip. Owens responded that Lieu had deliberately omitted an interviewer's question that provided critical context to her words, with the intent of misrepresenting them as an endorsement of Hitler, to smear her reputation.[166] She concluded this testimony by stating her opinion Lieu was \"assuming that black people will not pursue the full two hour clip\" and that the full clip had been \"purposefully extracted\" in order to \"create a different narrative.\"[167] Donald Trump Jr. praised Owens on Twitter for \"[calling] out the Dems on their purposeful manipulation of facts for their narrative\".[168]\n\nMention in Christchurch shooter's manifesto[edit]\nBrenton Harrison Tarrant, the terrorist who committed the Christchurch mosque shootings, produced a manifesto prior to committing the shootings in which he wrote that Owens had \"influenced [him] above all\".[169][170] According to journalist Robert Evans, it was \"possible, even likely\", that Tarrant was a fan of Owens, considering her rhetoric against Muslim immigrants but that, in context, his references to her may have been an example of \"shitposting\" intended to provoke political conflict.[171][172] For instance, the line \"Though I will have to disavow some of [Owens's] beliefs, the extreme actions she calls for are too much, even for my tastes\" was assessed by The Root as trolling.[173]\nHours after the shootings, Owens posted a tweet in reaction to allegations that she inspired the mass murder, saying that she never created any content espousing her views on the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution or Islam.[174] Her tweet was criticized as \"glib\" when it was reported that she actually had posted tweets about the Second Amendment and Islam.[175][176][177][113] She later made formal statements rejecting any connection to the terrorist.[113]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nOwens met her British husband, George Farmer, in 2018 at the launch event for Turning Point UK, a conservative student organization. George Farmer, the son of Lord Farmer, was the chairman of Turning Point UK at the time. The two developed a connection through their shared conservative values and eventually started dating before George's proposal to her just weeks after their first meeting. The two became engaged in 2019 and were married in August that year at the Trump Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia.[25][178][179][180][181] Numerous guests were present at the ceremony, including Larry Elder and Kanye West.[182]\nSince her marriage, Owens is now also (officially) known as The Hon. Mrs. George Farmer.[183][184]\nOwens gave birth to a boy in January 2021,[185] a daughter in July 2022[186] and another boy in late November of 2023.[citation needed]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nOwens, Candace (2020).

She is the head of the Judicial Crisis Network (JCN), where she supported the Supreme Court nominations of Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh. She is the coauthor (with Mollie Hemingway) of Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.\n\n\nBackground and early career[edit]\nSeverino, born Carrie Campbell, grew up in Michigan. Her father is an oncologist, and her mother is a nurse.[2]\nSeverino attended Duke University, graduating in 1999 with a B.A. in biology. In 2001 she received a master's degree in Linguistics from Michigan State University.[3]\nWhile attending Harvard Law School, she met her future husband Roger Severino, two years ahead of her there. Both were active with the law school's Society for Law, Life and Religion, a conservative anti-abortion group.[4]\nIn 2004, after receiving her JD from Harvard Law School, Severino worked as a law clerk for Judge David B. Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.[2][3]\nShe was a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for a year (2007\u20132008).[5] She later spent time at Georgetown University Law Center with an Olin/Searle Fellowship,[6] an award funded by the Federalist Society that \"offers top young lawyers with a scholarly bent the opportunity to spend 1-2 years to write and develop their scholarship with the goal of entering the legal academy.\"[7]\n\nJudicial Crisis Network[edit]\nMain article: Judicial Crisis Network\nOn March 22, 2010, the Judicial Crisis Network hired Severino as their policy director and chief spokesperson.[8]\nThe Judicial Crisis Network (JCN) is an American conservative advocacy organization, described in 2020 by OpenSecrets as having \"unmatched influence in recent years in shaping the federal judiciary.\"[9] JCN has worked closely on judicial appointments with conservative Catholic activist Leonard Leo and with the Federalist Society, which is in the same hallway of a DC office building.[10][11][12] In 2022, JCN's \"About\" page describes her role as \"chief counsel and policy director.\"[13]\nSeverino and the JCN have played a prominent role in several political battles related to the United States Supreme Court.  In 2016, Mother Jones described Severino as \"a leader of the current conservative campaign to block any Obama Supreme Court nominee.\"[14] Under her leadership, the Judicial Crisis Network spent more than $5 million on the campaign to oppose Obama's 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.[15]\nDuring the 2016 Presidential election Severino and the Judicial Crisis Network made filling the seat to which Garland had been nominated a central issue. Asserting that Trump's victory reflected voters' wish for conservatives on the Supreme Court, Severino announced JCN's plan to spend $10 million campaigning for Neil Gorsuch's appointment.[16] Severino attended the White House swearing-in ceremony for Gorsuch.[17]\nSeverino also played a prominent role in the Judicial Crisis Network campaign to  support the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, on which JCN spent $4.5 million in ad buys. In an appearance on CNN, Severino defended Kavanaugh from allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford, saying that the allegation \"covered a whole range of conduct, from boorishness to rough horseplay to actual attempted rape.\"[18] Jia Tolentino, writing in The New Yorker, criticized the \"horseplay\" comment as minimizing  what Tolentino described as \"sexual assault.\"[19]\nIn September 2020, after the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Severino and Judicial Crisis Network enlisted support from what Severino called a \"war room\" of pro-Catholic and pro-business advocacy groups including the Susan B. Anthony List, Catholic Vote, America First Policies, the Club for Growth and Heritage Action.[20][21] The Judicial Crisis Network launched a $2.2 million campaign to support President Trump's right to appoint a judge prior to the November 2020 presidential election.[22]\nIn a widely reported presentation to the Judiciary Committee during confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse singled out Severino by name as a major player in what he called \"a $250 million dark money operation\" to influence the selection of judges.[23][24] Severino defended the practice of groups such as the JCN receiving funding from anonymous donors, saying that the goal of anonymity was not secrecy, but rather to protect  her donors from \"harassment\" if their names were made public.[20][25]\n\nJustice on Trial[edit]\nSeverino is the coauthor (with Mollie Hemingway) of Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court (2019). According to The Washingtonian, the book \"hit bestseller lists\" in the summer of 2019.[26] The book attracted both positive and negative comments. \nJames R. Copeland in the Washington Post called the book \"a must-read for those who follow the politics of the federal judiciary\", saying that \"Hemingway and Severino frame the Kavanaugh story in the broader judicial confirmation context\" beginning with 1987's fight over Robert Bork  and covering what he calls \"the campaign against Severino\u2019s mentor [Justice Clarence] Thomas four years later.\"[27]\nJohn Kass in the Chicago Tribune called it a \"highly readable bestseller\" that \"starts out like a thriller \u2014 with the fate of the republic in the balance.\"[28]\nLara Bazelon in Politico criticized the book as \"so one-sided that it read more like a legal brief written by two very competent and fiercely committed advocates\" but added that \"Hemingway and Severino do make important points\" concerning the presumption of innocence.[29]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nSeverino is married to Roger Severino, the former head of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s Office for Civil Rights.[20] They have six children. Both Severinos are conservative Catholics.[20]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Williamson, Elizabeth (October 15, 2020). \"With Barrett Nomination, a D.C. Conservative Power Couple Nears Its Dream\".
