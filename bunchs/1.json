    "wiki": "American journalist\n\n\nAlex PareenePareene in New York, May 2012Born1984/1985Alma\u00a0materNew York UniversityOccupation(s)Journalist, writer, editorEmployerThe New Republic\nAlex Pareene (born 1984 or 1985) is an American journalist, writer, and editor. He was the editor-in-chief of the online news magazine Gawker.[1] Pareene later served as a senior editor at Deadspin and editor-in-chief of Splinter News, before becoming a staff writer at The New Republic.  As of 2022, he published a newsletter on Substack called \"The AP (Alex Pareene) Newsletter\".\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nPareene grew up in south Minneapolis, Minnesota, and graduated from Minneapolis South High School, where he wrote for the school's newspaper and took part in the extracurricular theater program.[2] He attended New York University to study playwriting, but later dropped out.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\nPareene began his career writing a blog entitled \"Buck Hill.\"[4]\nIn January 2006 he started writing for the Washington, D.C. political gossip blog Wonkette, then a part of Gawker Media, before he moved to their main web property Gawker in October 2007. In April 2010 he left Gawker to write about politics for the online news magazine Salon.[5][6]  In their farewell post, the Gawker staff wrote of Pareene, \"His writing is hysterical, his voice is unique, and his political mind is finely tuned into the idiocies and hypocrisies of our crumbling democracy.\"[5] He later joined First Look Media to launch the blog Racket with Matt Taibbi. In January 2015, he rejoined Gawker Media.[1] He was Gawker's editor-in-chief from October 2015 to August 2016, when the site ended operations.[7][8]\nPareene later served as a senior editor at Deadspin and editor-in-chief of Splinter News, before becoming a staff writer at The New Republic in 2019.[9][10][11] As of 2022, he published a newsletter on Substack called \"The AP (Alex Pareene) Newsletter\".[12]\n\nHack List[edit]\nAt Salon, the rise of personalities who dominate the 24-hour news cycle continued to be one of Pareene's mainstay concerns.[13] Salon published a yearly list composed by Pareene called the Hack 30: The Worst Pundits in America, a list of people described as \"the most predictable, banal, intellectually dishonest and all-around hacky newspaper columnists, cable news shouting heads and political opinion-mongers working today.\"[14][15] The Columbia Journalism Review described the list as a \"fun-to-read, blunt, stick-it-in-deep-and-twist-it list of mostly old-world print-y pundits.\"[16]  The list became so popular in media circles that Pareene began composing essay-length posts throughout the year about each person featured in the list to expound upon what he considered to be their hackery.[17]\n\nDonald Trump[edit]\nPareene has been a frequent critic of Donald Trump, both before and after his election as President. At varying times Pareene has referred to Trump as a \"fictional television clown tycoon\", \"a living freak show\" and \"a weird attention-hungry idiot.\"[18][19][20]\nOn August 15, 2012, Trump criticized Pareene on Twitter as a \"lightweight reporter\" who is a \"total joke in political circles\".[21][22]  Over the previous week Trump had been alluding to a \"very, very major\" surprise for the 2012 Republican National Convention that would be \"unique and interesting\".[23][24]  Pareene had written that Trump's surprise \"is almost definitely just going to be some idiotic video where Trump 'fires' [a Barack Obama] impersonator.\"[25]  One day later, Obama impersonator Kevin Michel posted on his Twitter feed a picture of himself with Trump and advised his followers to \"watch the Republican National Convention\", prompting some news outlets to conjecture that Trump was upset that Pareene had accurately predicted his surprise.[26][27][28]  When interviewed by Politico about Trump's criticism, Pareene responded, \"I was hoping the first universally loathed NBC personality to publicly call me out would be the monkey from Animal Practice, but I'll settle for Trump.\"[29]\n\nBooks[edit]\nA Tea People's History, October 2, 2011, 49 pages, Salon Media Group, ASIN\u00a0B005S4GS54\nThe Rude Guide To Mitt, April 17, 2012, 51 pages, Salon Media Group, ASIN\u00a0B007UPDEG0\nSee also[edit]\nAna Marie Cox\nNick Denton\nMaureen O'Connor\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Alex Pareene returns to Gawker Media\", Jeremy Barr, Capital New York, January 7, 2015\n\n^ Gihring, Tim (February 7, 2017). \"Sex, lies, and Hulk Hogan: How a South High grad is riding the storm of Trump-era journalism\".

She has played Samantha Micelli in Who's the Boss?, Jennifer Mancini in Melrose Place, Phoebe Halliwell in Charmed, Billie Cunningham in My Name Is Earl, Savannah \"Savi\" Davis in Mistresses, Renata Murphy in Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later, and Coralee Armstrong in Insatiable.\nAs an activist, Milano is known for her role in the MeToo movement in October 2017.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nAlyssa Jayne Milano was born in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of New York City's Brooklyn borough on December 19, 1972,[1] the daughter of fashion designer and talent manager Lin Milano and film music editor Thomas M. Milano.[citation needed] She is of Italian descent[2] and has a brother named Cory,[3] who is a decade younger.[4] She was raised Catholic.[5]\n\nCareer[edit]\n1980\u20131996[edit]\nMilano began her career at age seven, when her babysitter, without notifying her parents, took her to an audition for the national touring company of Annie. She was one of four selected from more than 1,500 girls. During the course of her work in the play, Milano and her mother were on the road for 18 months. After returning to New York, Milano appeared in television commercials,[6] and performed several roles in off-Broadway productions, including the first American musical adaptation of Jane Eyre. When accompanying a friend from the Annie production to the office of a New York agent, Milano was introduced to the agent, who began representing her.[7] She does not feel that growing up in front of the camera harmed her childhood[4] and has said: \"I love my family very much \u2013 they've really backed my career. I consider myself to be normal: I've got to clean my room, and help in the kitchen.\"[8]\nIn August 1984, Milano made her film debut in the coming-of-age drama Old Enough, which she recalled as a \"great\" way for \"starting out\".[1] The film was screened at the Sundance Film Festival,[9] where it won First Prize.[10]\nMilano auditioned as the daughter of Tony Danza's character on the sitcom Who's the Boss? After winning the part, she and her family moved to Los Angeles, where the show was produced. It premiered on ABC on September 20, 1984.[7] Throughout Who's the Boss?, Milano developed a close relationship with co-star Danza.[11] Commenting on their early years together, Danza observed: \"She was just the sweetest little girl of all time ... She became much like my daughter.\"[7] The series established Milano as a teen idol,[7][12][13] and provided her opportunities for other roles.[12] Her education was split between school and an on-set tutor with whom Milano would work for three hours a day.[14]\n\nMilano with Nancy Reagan in 1987\nAt age 12, Milano co-starred in Commando as Jenny Matrix, the daughter of John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger).[12] Subsequently, she starred in the children's film The Canterville Ghost, which did not achieve much praise or attention and Variety magazine noted in its review: \"Milano as the catalyzing daughter Jennifer adapts to the ghostly Sir Simon without a qualm; that, of course, is the true charm of the story, but Milano doesn't exhibit enough presence to match the droll, charming Gielgud\".[15]\nA few years later this film was shown in Japan, prompting a producer to offer Milano a five-album record deal. Milano's albums, which she described as \"bubblegum pop\", scored platinum in the country, though she later criticised their musical quality.[1] She has noted her love of English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) during her teenage years.[16]\nOn stage, Milano starred in Tender Offer, a one-act play written by Wendy Wasserstein, All Night Long by American playwright John O'Keefe,[17][18] and the first American musical adaptation of Jane Eyre. She returned to the theater in 1991, producing and starring in a Los Angeles production of Butterflies Are Free from December 26, 1991, to January 19, 1992.[7]\nMilano starred in two 1988 television films, Crash Course and Dance 'til Dawn. Both projects allowed her to work alongside close personal friend Brian Bloom, who worked with his brother Scott with her in episodes of Who's the Boss; this working camaraderie would later expand in 1993 when Milano made a cameo appearance in Bloom's film The Webbers. She produced a teen workout video, Teen Steam, and achieved some fame outside the US with her music career, which lasted until the early 1990s. Even though she scored platinum in Japan, Milano had no interest to pursue a music career in the United States: \"I'm not interested in crossing over. I'd much rather have it released where it's appreciated than laughed at.\"[7] Simultaneously, she wrote a weekly column called \"From Alyssa, with love\" for the teen magazine Teen Machine.[19]\nMilano played a teenage prostitute in the 1992 independent film Where the Day Takes You. The film, which focuses on a group of young runaway and homeless teenagers,[20] was shot on and around Hollywood Boulevard.[21] and was met with positive critical reception.[22] It was nominated for the Critics Award at the Deauville Film Festival, and won the Golden Space Needle Award at the Seattle International Film Festival.[23]\nAlthough Milano feared that viewers would only recognize her as \"the girl from Who's the Boss?\",[7] she was noticed by the media, which helped her land the role of Amy Fisher in the high-profile TV movie Casualties of Love: The \"Long Island Lolita\" Story, one of three TV films based on Fisher's shooting of Mary Jo Buttafuoco.[24][25] Milano said that her portrayal of Fisher in the film, which was based on the Buttafuoco's point of view,[24] \"was the least 'Alyssa' of anything [she had] done.\"[11] The film was shot from November\u2013December 1992.[26] She welcomed the cancellation of the series, as she was ready to move on to other roles and enthusiastic to \"showcase\" what she was able to do. Looking back on eight years of playing the same role, Milano commented, \"Creatively, it's been very frustrating. I gave her more of a personality. I changed her wardrobe, cut her hair, anything to give her new life.\"[7]\nIn the early 1990s, Milano auditioned for nearly every film role in her age bracket, including B movies,[7] and finally tried to shed her \"nice girl\" image by appearing nude in several erotic films targeted at adults, such as Embrace of the Vampire, Deadly Sins and Poison Ivy II: Lily. She said the nude appearances taught her to begin requiring a nudity clause in her contracts giving her \"full control\" over all her nude scenes.[11] In a 1995 interview, she explained her motivation for some explicit scenes in Embrace of the Vampire: \"I'm not going to say that I was manipulated into doing things that I didn't want to do. I did it because it was a woman director and I felt protected. And I learned a lot as far as knowing where the camera is and what coverage they need so that it's not all explicit.\"[19]\nShe starred in other roles, such as Candles in the Dark, Confessions of a Sorority Girl, The Surrogate, To Brave Alaska and Fear, which did not receive very positive reviews, although Jack Matthews of the Los Angeles Times called Milano's performance in Fear \"very good\".[27]\n\n1997\u20132010[edit]\nMilano in 2003\nMilano starred in the lead role in Hugo Pool (1997).\nIn late 1996, Milano was offered a role of Jennifer Mancini on the drama Melrose Place by producer Aaron Spelling:[28] \"We were looking for someone with sparkle. Alyssa was the perfect choice.\"[29] She left early in season seven. In 1998, she was cast as Phoebe Halliwell, one of the three lead characters on Spelling's show Charmed. She and Holly Marie Combs became producers for the show during season four. The series ran for eight seasons, concluding in 2006.[30]\nAlso in 1998, she played Mark Hoppus's love interest in the music video for Blink-182's \"Josie\".[31]\nIn the early 2000s, Milano played Eva Savelot in MCI Inc. commercials for that company's 1-800-COLLECT campaign.[32][33]\nIn 2007, Milano's commercial work included two 2007 television ads for Veet and Sheer Cover. That year, she filmed a pilot for ABC called Reinventing the Wheelers, which was not picked up for the 2007\u201308 season. That season she appeared in ten episodes of My Name Is Earl.[34]\nMilano was part of TBS's special coverage installment Hot Corner for the 2007 Major League Baseball playoffs.[35] A fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, in April 2007, Milano began writing a baseball blog on the Major League Baseball's website.[36] That year she reported at Fenway Park during the ALDS between the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[37]\nThe same year, she launched her signature \"Touch\" line of team apparel for female baseball fans, selling it through her blog on Major League Baseball's website.[38] It also became available in 2009 through a boutique store located in Citi Field, the home of the New York Mets.[39] She has an interest in the Los Angeles Kings,[40] a National Hockey League team, and is involved with a related clothing line. In 2008, she expanded that to NFL football, as a New York Giants fan. Since Milano is from the same hometown as NFL Network's Rich Eisen, she revealed some of her family's connections with the Giants.[41] In 2013, Milano expanded \"Touch\" into NASCAR.[42]\nOn March 20, 2009, it was announced that Milano voiced Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn in Ghostbusters: The Video Game.[43] In a 2010 interview she told the press that she had 'a blast' working on the game, although she recalled it being 'odd' having to grunt in a room alone.[44] On March 24, 2009, her book on her baseball fandom, Safe At Home: Confessions of a Baseball Fanatic, was released. Milano has signed on to star in and produce My Girlfriend's Boyfriend, a romantic comedy in which she plays a woman with a relationship dilemma.[45] Milano starred in the sitcom Romantically Challenged as Rebecca Thomas, a recently divorced single mother attorney in Pittsburgh who has not dated \"since Bill Clinton was president\". The series premiered on ABC on April 19, 2010.[46] The series was cancelled after airing four episodes.[47][48] Milano produced and led the cast of Lifetime's TV film Sundays at Tiffany's.[49] which was her second collaboration with Lifetime, after Wisegal (2008).[49]\n\n2011\u2013present[edit]\nMilano promoting her graphic novel Hacktivist in 2015\nIn 2011, Milano appeared in two comedy films, Hall Pass and New Year's Eve.[50]\nIn 2013, Milano created the comic book series Hacktivist, which was written by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly, drawn by Marcus To, and published by Archaia Entertainment. The book, which explores the modern world of hacking and global activism, is described as \"a fast-paced cyber-thriller about friendship and freedom in a time of war\". The publication was released digitally in late 2013, while the first print edition issue of the four-issue miniseries was published in January 2014. A hardcover edition collecting all four issues was released in July 2014.[51] The series received positive reviews, as it holds a score of 8.1 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup.[52]\nIn June 2013, she played Savannah Davis in ABC drama series Mistresses, which is about the scandalous lives of four girlfriends,[53] but she left the show after season two, due to conflict between filming location and family issue.[54][55] She signed on as host and judge Project Runway: All Stars beginning with season three.[56] On March 2, 2015, Milano was a guest host on The Talk.[57] In September 2015, Milano began to make appearances as a brand ambassador for the preschool television channel Sprout, being billed as the network's \"mom-bassador\".[58]\nIn 2017 and 2018, Milano joined the cast of two Netflix comedy series: Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later[59] and Insatiable.[60] In 2018 she was cast in the lead role in Tempting Fate, based on the best-selling book by Jane Green.[61]\nIn 2019, she released a children's book Hope: Project Middle School Book which is part of her 'Hope' book series which she co-authors with Debbie Rigaud.[62]\nAlso in 2019, Milano began hosting the podcast Alyssa Milano: Sorry Not Sorry. The podcast deals with social and political commentary and frequently features actors, activists, and political luminaries.[63]\nIn 2020, Milano was a recurring star on the Quibi comedy The Now.[64] In 2021, Milano was cast to star in the Netflix film adaptation of Nora Roberts' novel Brazen Virtue.[65]\nIn October 2021, Milano's book Sorry Not Sorry was released. It contains 32 essays describing her activism and thoughts on current political and social issues.[66] On October 29, 2021, she signed a first-look production deal with A&E Studios.[67] She also signed a deal with the United Talent Agency (UTA) more recently, on December 13, 2021.[68]\n\nOther ventures[edit]\nShe has appeared on the cover of numerous magazines, including Cosmopolitan, Stuff, Seventeen, Cleo, Woman's World, Veronica, Maxim and FHM.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] She has appeared in television commercials for Wen, Candies, Veet,  Hi-C and Atkins diet. She was a spokesmodel for Sheer Cover cosmetics.[citation needed]\n\nActivism[edit]\nIn the late 1980s, Milano contacted Ryan White, a preteen boy ostracized for having AIDS, and a fan of hers.[14][69] She attended a party for him where she sat with him for six hours making friendship bracelets.[70] They appeared together on The Phil Donahue Show, where Milano kissed White on the cheek to emphasize that people do not catch the disease through casual contact.[71]\nIn October 2004, Milano participated in UNICEF's \"Trick or Treat\" campaign as the national spokesperson.[72] She raised approximately US$50,000 for South African women and children with AIDS by selling her own and schools' photo work.[73]\nIn support of PETA, she appeared in a 2007 advertisement for them, advocating vegetarianism, in a dress made entirely of vegetables.[74][75]\nIn June 2007, The Sabin Vaccine Institute, named Milano a Founding Ambassador for the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases, an alliance formed to advocate and mobilize resources in the fight to control neglected tropical diseases, to which Milano donated US$250,000. She is also a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for the United States of America,[76][77] Her field work for the organization has included a 2004 trip to Angola to speak with HIV-positive women and people disfigured by land mines during the country's civil war; a trip to India to meet displaced mothers living in squalor following the 2004 tsunami; and a 2010 trip to the settlement of Kolonia in western Kosovo to witness impoverished living conditions. Milano wrote on her blog that the latter trip was \"the hardest experience I've had on a field visit\", and described a waste dump close to the settlement where children spent time looking for metal to sell or scavenging for food.[78]\n\nMilano in 2011\nFor her 37th birthday, December 19, 2009, Milano ran an online fundraising campaign for Charity: Water. Her original goal was to raise US$25,000, but a donation from her husband led to a total of over US$75,000 on December 18. The fundraiser ran until December 26.[79] In September 2013, Milano released a parody of a celebrity sex tape on Funny or Die that drew attention to the Syrian civil war.[80][81]\nIn 2014, Milano, with the South Korean rescue group, CARE, and The Fuzzy Pet Foundation in Santa Monica, helped rescue a South Korean Jindo mix dog, found covered in mange, chained, and raised for dog-meat.[82][83][84]\nOn October 15, 2017, Milano posted the message that re-launched what is known as the #MeToo movement, which was started in 2006 by Tarana Burke. According to Milano, a friend suggested that she post a message on her Twitter account encouraging survivors of sexual harassment and assault to post #metoo as a status update. This was to gauge the widespread problem of sexual misconduct. She was inspired to bring awareness to the commonality of sexual abuse of women in the wake of Harvey Weinstein's expulsion from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for sex crimes against women in the film industry.[85] Milano emphasized that the basis of her hashtag was to create a platform where women had an \"opportunity without having to go into detail about their stories if they did not want to\".[86]\nSince 2004, Milano has canvassed for national, state, and local candidates.[87]\nIn 2018, she was announced as a co-chair of the Health Care Voter campaign.[88] She wrote an op-ed in Time on why health care would decide her vote in 2018.[89] In July 2018, and again in December 2020, Milano encouraged Twitter users to seek out VoteRiders to help eliminate confusion about voter ID laws.[90][91]\nMilano, who spoke at the 2018 Women's March, refused to participate in 2019, citing the failure of 2019 Women's March leaders Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour to condemn the homophobia, antisemitism, and transphobia of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.[92][93] In 2018, she was selected as one of the \"Silence Breakers\", who were picked as Time Person of the Year.[94]\nIn May 2019, Milano advocated celibacy in the form of a sex strike in retaliation of a recently passed abortion law in the U.S. state of Georgia.[95]\nIn October 2021, Milano was arrested during a voting rights demonstration outside the White House.[96]\nIn November 2022, Milano announced via Twitter that she had exchanged her Tesla for a Volkswagen electric vehicle.  She declared, \"I gave back my Tesla, I bought the VW ev. I love it. I'm not sure how advertisers can buy space on Twitter. Publicly traded company's products being pushed in alignment with hate and white supremacy doesn't seem to be a winning business model.\"  Critics were quick to point out Volkswagen's past relationship with the Nazi Party which founded the then state owned company in 1937.[97][98]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMilano was involved with actor Corey Haim from 1987 to 1990. Milano and her parents, together with his manager at the time, unsuccessfully tried to get Haim help for his addiction.[99] In 1993, she became engaged to actor Scott Wolf, but they broke off their engagement the following year. She later revealed in August 2019 that she had undergone two abortions while in the relationship with Wolf.[100]\nIn 1998, Milano sued adult websites for publishing faked nude photographs of her.[101]\nOn January 1, 1999, Milano married singer Cinjun Tate. They separated on November 20, 1999, and were divorced on December 1, 1999.[102][103][104]\nIn a 2004 interview, Milano explained how she deals with her dyslexia: \"I've stumbled over words while reading from teleprompters. Sir John Gielgud, whom I worked with on The Canterville Ghost years ago, gave me great advice. When I asked how he memorized his monologues, he said, 'I write them down.' I use that method to this day. It not only familiarizes me with the words, it makes them my own.\"[105]\nAfter a year of dating, Milano became engaged to CAA agent David Bugliari in December 2008.[106] They were married at Bugliari's family home in New Jersey on August 15, 2009.[107] They had a son on August 31, 2011,[108][109] and a daughter on September 4, 2014.[110][111]\nIn 2015, Milano sold her condominium in West Hollywood and moved to Bell Canyon, California, where she owns land and her then nine horses, eight chickens, two rabbits, and five dogs.[112][113]\nIn 2017, Milano's $10 million lawsuit against her business manager resulted in a cross-complaint.[114][115]\nIn 2021 she was a passenger in a car crash. The car she was in was being driven by her uncle who had a medical condition. The car veered into another lane and crashed.[116]\nOn December 21, 2022, Milano wrote a tweet about her concern for Britney Spears's well-being, which read \"Someone please go check on Britney Spears\". Spears herself responded to the tweet on Instagram stories on January 31, 2023, and accused Milano of 'bullying' her following a police welfare check when fans of Spears were worried after she deleted her Instagram for a seventh time. Milano has since apologized for the tweet.[117]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nFollowing the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Milano co-Founded #NoRA, a coalition of artists, activist, and survivors of gun violence in an effort to reduce the influence of the National Rifle Association of America in American government.[118] In September 2019, Milano met with Ted Cruz and Fred Guttenberg to discuss gun violence. Guttenberg said this was \"a really important day.\"[119]\nMilano helped raise money for Richard Dien Winfield,[120][121] a Democrat in Georgia's 2018 10th congressional district race.[122] Milano phone banked, a political campaign strategy to collect voter data and get out the vote, with Piper Perabo and drove people to the polls for the United States Senate special election in Alabama on December 12, 2017, to vote for Democratic candidate Doug Jones.[123] Milano, with actor Christopher Gorham, drove voters to the polls during early voting[124] and on March 27, 2017, for Georgia's 6th congressional district 2017 special election for Jon Ossoff,[125] and she later posted photos of herself with the voters on Instagram.[126][127] Milano and Gorham had been in the area for the pilot of Insatiable.[128]\nIn 2015, Milano endorsed Bernie Sanders for President of the United States.[129] In 2016, after the Democratic Party presidential primaries, she expressed support for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.[130] She was also involved in get-out-the-vote efforts for Rob Quist.[131]\nIn March 2020, Milano endorsed former US vice president Joe Biden for president of the United States.[132] She declined to withdraw her endorsement of Biden despite a sexual assault allegation against him.[133] On April 27, Milano tweeted that she was \"aware of the new developments in Tara Reade's accusation against Joe Biden. I want Tara, like every other survivor, to have the space to be heard and seen without being used as fodder. I hear and see you, Tara.\"[134] This was after criticism of Milano's support for Biden where she appeared to backtrack on her previous stance for believing women.[135] On April 28, in an op-ed for Deadline Hollywood, Milano reiterated her support for Biden and considered \"Believing women was never about 'Believe all women no matter what they say,' it was about changing the culture of NOT believing women by default.\"[136]\nIn October 2023, Milano signed an open letter to Joe Biden, President of the United States, of artists calling for a ceasefire of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.[137]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1984\n\nOld Enough\n\nDiane\n\n\n\n\n1985\n\nCommando\n\nJenny Matrix\n\n\n\n\n1988\n\nTeen Steam\n\nAlyssa Milano\n\n\n\n\n1989\n\nSpeed Zone\n\nLurleen\n\nalternate title: Cannonball Fever\n\n\n1992\n\nWhere the Day Takes You\n\nKimmy\n\n\n\n\nLittle Sister\n\nDiana\n\n\n\n\n1993\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nEve\n\n\n\n\n1994\n\nDouble Dragon\n\nMarian Delario\n\n\n\n\n1995\n\nEmbrace of the Vampire\n\nCharlotte Wells\n\n\n\n\nGlory Daze\n\nChelsea\n\n\n\n\nDeadly Sins\n\nCristina Herrera\n\n\n\n\n1996\n\nPoison Ivy II: Lily\n\nLily Leonetti\n\nDirect to video\n\n\nFear\n\nMargo Masse\n\n\n\n\nPublic Enemies\n\nAmaryllis\n\nDirect to video\n\n\nJimmy Zip\n\nFrancesca\n\nShort film\n\n\n1997\n\nBelow Utopia\n\nSusanne\n\nAlso producer\n\n\nHugo Pool\n\nHugo Dugay\n\n\n\n\n2001\n\nLady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure\n\nAngel (voice)\n\nDirect to video\n\n\n2002\n\nBuying the Cow\n\nAmy\n\n\n\n\nKiss the Bride\n\nAmy Kayne\n\n\n\n\n2003\n\nDickie Roberts: Former Child Star\n\nCyndi\n\n\n\n\n2005\n\nDinotopia: Quest for the Ruby Sunstone\n\n26 (voice)\n\nDirect to video\n\n\n2007\n\nThe Blue Hour\n\nAllegra\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\nPathology\n\nGwen Williamson\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\nDC Showcase: The Spectre\n\nAimee Brenner (voice)\n\nShort film\n\n\nMy Girlfriend's Boyfriend\n\nJesse Young\n\nAlso producer\n\n\n2011\n\nBeverly Hills Chihuahua 2\n\nBiminy (voice)\n\nDirect to video\n\n\nHall Pass\n\nMandy Bohac\n\n\n\n\nNew Year's Eve\n\nNurse Mindy\n\nSegment: \"Hospital Story\"\n\n\n2018\n\nLittle Italy\n\nDora\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\nBrazen\n\nGrace\n\n\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1984\u20131992\n\nWho's the Boss?\n\nSamantha Micelli\n\nMain role, 196 episodes\n\n\n1986\n\nThe Canterville Ghost\n\nJennifer Canterville\n\nTV movie\n\n\n1988\n\nCrash Course\n\nVanessa Crawford\n\nTV movie alternative title: Driving Academy\n\n\nDance 'til Dawn\n\nShelley Sheridan\n\nTV movie\n\n\n1989\n\nLiving Dolls\n\nSamantha Micelli\n\n2 episodes\n\n\nThe Making of The Little Mermaid\n\nHerself (Host)\n\nTV special\n\n\n1993\n\nCasualties of Love: The Long Island Lolita Story\n\nAmy Fisher\n\nTV movie\n\n\nAt Home with the Webbers\n\nFan\n\n\nCandles in the Dark\n\nSylvia Velliste\n\n\n1994\n\nConfessions of a Sorority Girl\n\nRita Summers\n\n\n1995\n\nThe Surrogate\n\nAmy Winslow\n\n\nThe Outer Limits\n\nHannah Valesic\n\nEpisode: \"Caught in the Act\"\n\n\n1996\n\nMr. Show with Bob and David\n\nAudience member\n\n2 episodes\n\n\nTo Brave Alaska\n\nDenise Harris\n\nTV movie\n\n\n1997 & 2001\n\nSpin City\n\nMeg Winston\n\n2 episodes\n\n\n1997\u20131998\n\nMelrose Place\n\nJennifer Mancini\n\n40 episodes in seasons 5\u20137\n\n\n1998\n\nGoldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure\n\nFrances Ella 'Fizzy' Fitz\n\nTV movie\n\n\nFantasy Island\n\nGina Williams\n\nEpisode: \"Superfriends\"\n\n\n1998\u20132006\n\nCharmed\n\nPhoebe Halliwell\n\nLead role; 178 episodes; also producer (seasons 5\u20138)\n\n\n2001\n\nThe Diamond Hunters\n\nTracy Van der Byl\n\nMiniseries\n\n\nFamily Guy\n\nHerself (live-action)\n\nEpisode: \"Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington\"\n\n\n2004\n\nThe Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius\n\nApril the Gorlock (voice)\n\nEpisode: \"Win, Lose and Kaboom\"\n\n\n2007\u20132008\n\nMy Name Is Earl\n\nBillie Cunningham\n\n10 episodes (season 3)\n\n\n2008\n\nWisegal\n\nPatty Montanari\n\nTV movie; also producer\n\n\n2010\n\nCastle\n\nKyra Blaine\n\nEpisode: \"A Rose for Everafter\"\n\n\nKick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil\n\nScarlett Rosetti (voice)\n\nEpisode: \"Frame Story/And...

He is a former columnist for The New York Times. He is the author of four books: India Calling: An Intimate Portrait of a Nation's Remaking (2011), The True American: Murder and Mercy in Texas (2014), Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World (2018), and The Persuaders: At the Front Lines of the Fight for Hearts, Minds, and Democracy (2022).\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nGiridharadas was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio; Maryland; and Paris, France.[2][3][4] His childhood visits to extended family members in India sparked an interest in that country that influenced his later writing.[5] He attended Sidwell Friends School.[6] He studied politics and history at the University of Michigan.[7]\nAs of 2010, Giridharadas was a doctoral candidate at Harvard University.[8]\n\nCareer[edit]\nGiridharadas speaking with Elizabeth Warren at SXSW 2019.\nAfter graduating from college, Giridharadas moved to Mumbai in 2003 as a consultant for the global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, where he followed the path of his father, who was a director at McKinsey. In 2005, he became a journalist, covering India for the International Herald Tribune and The New York Times.[9] In 2009, after returning to the United States, he began to write the \"Currents\" column for those newspapers.[10] He also writes longer magazine pieces.[11][12][13] In a 2020 New York Times Opinion piece,[14] he wrote about Biden's power to make transformational progress and endorsed The American Prospect's Day One Agenda.[15] He is a Henry Crown Fellow of the Aspen Institute,[16] an MSNBC commentator, and a visiting scholar at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at New York University.[17]\n\nSeat at the Table[edit]\nGiridharadas hosted the talk show Seat at the Table with Anand Giridharadas on Vice on TV. The show premiered in April 2020, and was canceled in July 2020.[18][19]\n\nThe.Ink[edit]\nIn June 2020, Giridharadas started the Substack newsletter The.Ink devoted to politics, culture, money and power. Most posts are free, while paid subscribers gain exclusive access to live events and the occasional special post.[20]\n\nBooks[edit]\nIndia Calling (2011)[edit]\nIn 2011, Giridharadas published his first book, India Calling: An Intimate Portrait of a Nation's Remaking.[4] In it he discusses the increasing opportunities the Indian economy provides. He also delves into class issues, and has said, \"in India, you're eternally a master and eternally a servant.\"[21]\nIn The Plain Dealer, Jo Gibson called the book \"readable\" and \"intriguing\" and Giridharadas \"a marvelous journalist\u2014intrepid, easy to like, curious.\"[4] In a review for The New York Times, Gaiutra Bahadur wrote, \"'India Calling' has what Hanif Kureishi once described as 'the sex of a syllogism.' Full-figured ideas animate every turn. So, simultaneously, does Giridharadas\u2019s eye for contradiction. The combination both pleases us and makes us wary\u2014distrustful of shapely ideas, including the author\u2019s own.\"[22]\n\nThe True American (2014)[edit]\nIn 2014, W. W. Norton and Company published Giridharadas's second book, The True American: Murder and Mercy in Texas. It centers on executed murderer Mark Stroman and a survivor of one of his shootings, Rais Bhuiyan. It explores Bhuiyan's forgiveness of Stroman and his campaign to save Stroman from capital punishment. At the time of the shootings, Stroman thought he was exacting revenge for the September 11, 2001 attacks, but his victims were immigrants from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.[23]\nIn his review for The Washington Post, Eboo Patel wrote that the book \"zooms out and illuminates the broader social context of the lives at the center\"[24] but that \"while plumbing the depths of Bhuiyan\u2019s Muslim heart, [Giridharadas] misses a wide-open opportunity to get to the heart of Islam.\"[24] In The Wall Street Journal, Stephen Harrigan wrote that Giridharadas is \"an enterprising and clear-eyed reporter and a generally smooth writer, though every 20 pages or so there appears a glistening chunk of linguistic gristle... But occasional maladroit phrases do no serious harm to his commanding narrative.\"[25]\n\nWinners Take All (2018)[edit]\nMain article: Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World\nIn 2018, Giridharadas published Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World in which he argues that members of the global elite, though sometimes engaged in philanthropy, use their wealth and influence to preserve systems that concentrate wealth at the top at the expense of societal progress. Writing for The New York Times, economist Joseph Stiglitz praised the book, writing that Giridharadas \"writes on two levels \u2014 seemingly tactful and subtle \u2014 but ultimately he presents a devastating portrait of a whole class, one easier to satirize than to reform.\"[26]\n\nThe Persuaders (2022)[edit]\nIn 2022, Giridharadas published The Persuaders: At the Front Lines of the Fight for Hearts, Minds, and Democracy. Amazon described the book as \"An insider account of activists, politicians, educators, and everyday citizens working to change minds, bridge divisions, and fight for democracy\u2014from disinformation fighters to a leader of Black Lives Matter to Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and more\".[27]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nGiridharadas lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his wife, author Priya B. Parker, and their two children.[28]\n\nWorks[edit]\nGiridharadas, Anand (2011). India Calling: An Intimate Portrait of a Nation's Remaking. New York: Times Books/Henry Holt and Company.

Cooper was hired by ABC News as a correspondent in 1995, but he soon took more jobs throughout the network, working for a short time as a co-anchor, reality game show host, and fill-in morning talk show host.\nIn 2001, Cooper joined CNN, where he was given his own show, Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0, in 2003; he has remained the show's host since. He developed a reputation for his on-the-ground reporting of breaking news events, with his coverage of Hurricane Katrina causing his popularity to sharply increase. For his coverage of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Cooper received a National Order of Honour and Merit, the highest honor granted by the Haitian government. From September 2011 to May 2013, he also served as the host of his own syndicated daytime talk show, Anderson Live.\nCooper has won 18 Emmy Awards and two Peabody Awards, as well as an Edward Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club in 2011. A member of the Vanderbilt family, he came out as gay in 2012, becoming \"the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television\".[2] In 2016, Cooper became the first openly LGBT person to moderate a presidential debate, and he has received several GLAAD Media Awards.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nCooper was born in Manhattan, New York City, the younger son of writer Wyatt Emory Cooper and artist Gloria Vanderbilt. His maternal grandparents were millionaire equestrian Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt of the Vanderbilt family and socialite Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and Reginald's patrilineal great-grandfather was business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who founded the prominent Vanderbilt shipping and railroad fortune.[3] He has two older half-brothers, Leopold Stanislaus \"Stan\" Stokowski (b. 1950) and Christopher Stokowski (b. 1952), from Gloria's ten-year marriage to conductor Leopold Stokowski.[4] In 2014, Cooper appeared in Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s Finding Your Roots, where he learned of an ancestor, Burwell Boykin, who was a slave owner from the southern United States.[5][6]\nCooper's media experience began early. As a baby, he was photographed by Diane Arbus for Harper's Bazaar.[7][8] At the age of three, Cooper was a guest on The Tonight Show on September 17, 1970, appearing with his mother.[citation needed] At the age of nine, he appeared on To Tell the Truth as an impostor. From age 10 to 13, Cooper modeled with Ford Models for Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Macy's.[9]\nWyatt experienced a series of heart attacks while undergoing open-heart surgery, and died January 5, 1978, at the age of 50. Cooper considers his father's book Families to be \"sort of a guide on... how he would have wanted me to live my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make. And so I feel very connected to him.\"[9]\nWhen Cooper was 21, his older brother, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, committed suicide on July 22, 1988, at age 23, by jumping from the 14th-floor terrace of Vanderbilt's New York City penthouse apartment. Gloria Vanderbilt later wrote about her son's death in the book A Mother's Story, in which she expressed her belief that the suicide was caused by a psychotic episode induced by an allergy to the anti-asthma prescription drug salbutamol. Carter's suicide sparked Anderson's interest in journalism:[9]\n\nLoss is a theme that I think a lot about, and it's something in my work that I dwell on. I think when you experience any kind of loss, especially the kind I did, you have questions about survival: Why do some people thrive in situations that others can't tolerate? Would I be able to survive and get on in the world on my own?\nCooper attended the Dalton School, a private co-educational day school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. At age 17, after graduating from Dalton a semester early, Cooper traveled around Africa for several months on a \"survival trip\". He contracted malaria on the trip and was hospitalized in Kenya. Describing the experience, Cooper wrote \"Africa was a place to forget and be forgotten in.\"[9][10][11] Cooper attended Yale University, where he resided in Trumbull College and was a coxswain on the lightweight rowing team. He was inducted into the Manuscript Society and majored in political science, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1989.[12]\n\nCareer\nEarly career\nDuring college, Cooper spent two summers as an intern at the Central Intelligence Agency while studying political science.[13] He pursued journalism with no formal journalistic education.[14][13] He is a self-proclaimed \"news junkie since [he] was in utero\".[15] After his first correspondence work in the early 1990s, he took a break from reporting and lived in Vietnam for a year, during which time he studied the Vietnamese language at Vietnam National University, Hanoi.[16]\n\nChannel One\nAfter Cooper graduated from Yale, he tried to gain entry-level employment with ABC answering telephones, but was unsuccessful. Finding it hard to get his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Cooper was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States.[17] Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government.[15]\nAfter reporting from Myanmar, Cooper lived in Vietnam for a year to study the Vietnamese language at the University of Hanoi. Persuading Channel One to allow him to bring a Hi8 camera with him, Cooper began filming and assembling reports of Vietnamese life and culture that aired on Channel One. In 1992, he filmed stories from Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda.[citation needed]\nAfter having been on such assignments for a couple of years, Cooper realized in 1994 that he had slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan genocide became trivial: \"I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad.\"[10] One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it:[10]\n\nOn the side of the road [Cooper] came across five bodies that had been in the sun for several days. The skin of a woman's hand was peeling off like a glove. Revealing macabre fascination, Cooper whipped out his disposable camera and took a closeup photograph for his personal album. As he did, someone took a photo of him. Later that person showed Cooper the photo, saying, \"You need to take a look at what you were doing.\" \"And that's when I realized I've got to stop, [...] I've got to report on some state fairs or a beauty pageant or something, to just, like, remind myself of some perspective.\"\nABC\nIn 1995, Cooper became a correspondent for ABC News, eventually rising to the position of co-anchor on its overnight World News Now program on September 21, 1999. In 2000, he switched career paths, taking a job as the host of ABC's reality show The Mole:[15]\n\nMy last year at ABC, I was working overnights anchoring this newscast, then during the day at 20/20. So I was sleeping in two- or four-hour shifts, and I was really tired and wanted a change. I wanted to clear my head and get out of news a little bit, and I was interested in reality TV\u2014and it was interesting.\nCooper was also a fill-in co-host for Regis Philbin on Live with Regis and Kelly in 2007 when Philbin underwent triple-bypass heart surgery.[18] As of 2019, he still periodically serves as guest co-host on Live when one of the two hosts cannot go in to work.[citation needed]\n\nCNN\nAnderson Cooper covering the Trump/Kim Summit in Singapore, 2018\nCooper left The Mole after its second season to return to broadcast news. In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, \"Two seasons was enough, and 9/11 happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news.\"[15] His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside Paula Zahn on American Morning. In 2002, he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square.[citation needed]\n\nAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0\nOn September 8, 2003, Cooper became the anchor of Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 on CNN. Describing his philosophy as an anchor, he has said:[15]\n\nI think the notion of traditional anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high. I don't think the audience really buys that anymore. As a viewer, I know I don't buy it. I think you have to be yourself, and you have to be real and you have to admit what you don't know, and talk about what you do know, and talk about what you don't know as long as you say you don't know it. I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona. The anchorman on The Simpsons is a reasonable facsimile of some anchors who have that problem.\nIn 2005, Cooper covered the tsunami damage in Sri Lanka; the Cedar Revolution in Beirut, Lebanon; the death of Pope John Paul II; and the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In August 2005, he covered the Niger famine from Maradi.[citation needed]\n\nCooper covering a 2007 protest of the government response to Hurricane Katrina\nIn 2005, during CNN coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about their perception of the government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with New York magazine, \"Yeah, I would prefer not to be emotional and I would prefer not to get upset, but it's hard not to when you're surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.\"[9] A contributor to Broadcasting & Cable magazine wrote: \"In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned coverage of the storm.\"[19]\nIn September 2005, the format of CNN's NewsNight was changed from 60 to 120 minutes to cover the unusually violent hurricane season. To help distribute some of the increased workload, Cooper was temporarily added as co-anchor to Aaron Brown. This arrangement was reported to have been made permanent the same month by the president of CNN's U.S. operations, Jonathan Klein, who has called Cooper \"the anchorperson of the future\".[20] Following the addition of Cooper, the ratings for NewsNight increased significantly; Klein remarked that \"[Cooper's] name has been on the tip of everyone's tongue.\"[21] To further capitalize on this, Klein announced a major programming shakeup on November 2, 2005. Cooper's 360\u00b0 program would be expanded to two hours and shifted into the 10:00pm ET slot formerly held by NewsNight, with the third hour of Wolf Blitzer's The Situation Room filling in Cooper's former 7:00pm ET slot. With \"no options\" left for him to host shows, Aaron Brown left CNN, ostensibly having \"mutually agreed\" with Jonathan Klein on the matter.[22]\n\nCooper at the inauguration of President Obama in Washington, D.C., 2009\nIn early 2007, Cooper signed a multi-year deal with CNN that would allow him to continue as a contributor to 60 Minutes, as well as doubling his salary from $2 million annually to a reported $4 million.[23]\n\nThe Whole Story with Anderson Cooper\nOn April 16, 2023, CNN launched a new Sunday primetime series, The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper.[24]\n\nCNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute\nIn 2007, he began hosting CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute, a show about extraordinary deeds by ordinary people.[citation needed]\n\nPlanet in Peril documentary\nIn October 2007, Cooper began hosting the documentary Planet in Peril with Sanjay Gupta and Jeff Corwin on CNN. In 2008, Cooper, Gupta, and Lisa Ling from National Geographic Explorer teamed up for a sequel, Planet in Peril: Battle Lines, which premiered in December 2008.[25][26]\n\nSyndicated talk show: Anderson Live\nIn September 2010, Warner Bros. and Telepictures (both corporate siblings of CNN) announced that Cooper had signed an agreement to host a nationally syndicated talk show. The journalist Brian Stelter (at the time employed by The New York Times, and now by CNN), reported on Twitter that the new Warner Bros. daytime talk show would be named Anderson (now titled Anderson Live).[27] The show premiered on September 12, 2011,[28] and as part of negotiations over the talk show deal, Cooper signed a new multi-year contract with CNN to continue as the host of Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0.[29][30] On October 29, 2012, it was announced that Anderson Live would end at the conclusion of its second season. The show, slightly renamed after season one and revamped with a variety of co-hosts, failed to achieve the ratings distributor Warner Brothers hoped for. The final Anderson Live aired on May 30, 2013.[citation needed]\n\n2016 presidential debates\nAlong with Martha Raddatz, Cooper moderated the second presidential election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.[31] This made him the first openly LGBT person to moderate a presidential debate in the general election.[32]\n\nNew Years Eve\nIn 2017, Cooper's close friend, Andy Cohen, joined Cooper in succeeding Kathy Griffin as co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage.[33][34] They again co-hosted CNN's New Year's Eve for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 .[35]\n\n60 Minutes\nCooper at the 71st Annual Peabody Awards (Astoria Hotel, May 21, 2012)\nCooper has been a correspondent for the CBS News program 60 Minutes since 2007, while concurrently serving as a CNN anchor and correspondent.[citation needed]\n\nOther work\nAC2\nAndy Cohen and Cooper announced that they would be going on a national tour to perform their conversational stage show AC2 beginning in March 2015.[36][37] The tour opened in Boston, followed by Miami Beach, Chicago and Atlanta.[37] The idea for the show came about after Cooper interviewed Cohen about his then-latest book, The Andy Cohen Diaries, at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City.[38][39] Since then, the two-man show has continued to tour, reaching more than fifty cities as of October 2018.[40]\n\nBroadway\nCooper was the narrator for the 2011 Broadway revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, directed by Rob Ashford and starring Daniel Radcliffe.[41]\n\nWritings\nA freelance writer, Cooper has authored a variety of articles that have appeared in many other outlets, including Details magazine.[42]\nIn May 2006, Cooper published a memoir for HarperCollins, Dispatches from the Edge, detailing his life and work in Sri Lanka, Africa, Iraq and Louisiana over the previous year. Some of the book's proceeds are donated to charity.[43] The book topped The New York Times Best Seller list on June 18, 2006.[44]\nIn 2017, Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, co-authored The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss. Compiled from a series of emails, the memoir recounts their shared past, and Vanderbilt's tumultuous childhood. Cooper said his goal in writing the book and correspondence was to leave \"nothing left unsaid\" between the pair.[45] It landed on multiple best-seller lists the year of its publication.[46]\n\nJeopardy!\nFrom April 19 to 30, 2021 Cooper served as a guest host on Jeopardy! following the death of Alex Trebek.[47]\n\nPodcast: All There Is\nIn 2022, Cooper launched a deeply personal podcast exploring grief and loss. On the show, he interviews other notable people on their experiences with grief. Guests have included TV host Stephen Colbert, musician Laurie Anderson and comedian Molly Shannon.[48] The inspiration for the podcast came from his own life. Reflecting on the loss of his father when he was 10, the loss of his brother to suicide at 21, and the more recent loss of his mother Gloria Vanderbilt, he said \u201cWhat has struck me is the degree to which I had not dealt with this stuff at all.\" He shared that he wanted to explore this universal human experience. \"I just felt like, \u2018Why am I so alone in this? This is something we all go through.' And this idea gave me great strength, that I\u2019m on a road that has been traveled by everybody, in one form or another. Why every time somebody is going down this road should it feel like the first time?\u201d [49]\n\nPersonal life\nCooper in 2018\nAs of 2016, Cooper was not registered to any political party.[50]\nWhile promoting his book, Cooper told Oprah Winfrey he had dyslexia as a child.[51]\nCooper is openly gay; as of 2012, he was (according to The New York Times) \"the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television\".[52] For years, Cooper avoided discussing his private life in interviews. On July 2, 2012, however, he gave Andrew Sullivan permission to publish an email that stated, in part:[53]\n\nI've begun to consider whether the unintended outcomes of maintaining my privacy outweigh personal and professional principle. It's become clear to me that by remaining silent on certain aspects of my personal life for so long, I have given some the mistaken impression that I am trying to hide something\u2014something that makes me uncomfortable, ashamed or even afraid. This is distressing because it is simply not true. ... The fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud.\nIn 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook, before making the decision to publicly come out as gay, sought Cooper's advice.[54]\nIn 2014, Cooper and his long-term partner at the time, Benjamin Maisani, purchased Rye House, a historic estate in Connecticut.[55] In March 2018, Cooper confirmed that he and  Maisani had split up.[56]\nCooper was friends with Anthony Bourdain, celebrity chef and host of the CNN series Parts Unknown. After Bourdain died by suicide on June 8, 2018, Cooper paid tribute to him in a CNN special program, Remembering Anthony Bourdain.[57][58] Cooper also paid tribute to Bourdain on the Thanksgiving 2020 episode of Anderson Cooper Full Circle, saying that he was \"proud to call Anthony Bourdain a friend\", and adding: \"He is so, so missed by so many.\"[59][60]\nIn 2021, Cooper and co-author Katherine Howe published Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of an American Dynasty, a history of the Vanderbilt family going back to his Vanderbilt ancestors who came to New Amsterdam in the 17th century.[61]\n\nChildren\nOn April 30, 2020, Cooper announced the birth of his son Wyatt Morgan Cooper by a surrogate on April 27. \"On Monday I became a father. I've never said that out loud and it astonishes me. I have a son,\" he said at the end of a CNN Town Hall on his show, Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0. He also went on to make an announcement on Instagram, stating that \"Wyatt Morgan Cooper was born on Monday weighing 7 pounds 2 ounces.\"[62][63]\nThough Cooper and Benjamin Maisani are no longer romantically involved, the pair co-parent the child and Maisani was present in the delivery room for Wyatt's birth. Wyatt is named after Cooper's late father, Wyatt Cooper, and his middle name is derived from the Morgan side of his family, being the maiden name of his maternal grandmother Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt.[64]\nOn February 10, 2022, Cooper announced at the beginning of his show on CNN that he had just become a father for a second time to a son named Sebastian Luke Maisani-Cooper. Maisani is in the process of adopting Cooper's son Wyatt, after which Wyatt's surname will become Maisani-Cooper.[65]\n\nAwards\nCooper accepting a Peabody Award in 2012 for CNN's coverage of the Arab Spring\nCooper helped lead CNN's Peabody Award-winning coverage of Hurricane Katrina, and the network's Alfred I. duPont\u2013Columbia University Award-winning coverage of the 2004 tsunami.

I know my mom and dad liked the name morgan because I recently found a list they made 52 years ago when they were trying to think of names for me. Wyatt Morgan Cooper. My son. He was 7.2 lbs at birth, and he is sweet, and soft, and healthy and I am beyond happy. As a gay kid, I never thought it would be possible to have a child, and I'm grateful for all those who have paved the way, and for the doctors and nurses and everyone involved in my son's birth. Most of all, I am grateful to a remarkable surrogate who carried Wyatt, and watched over him lovingly, and tenderly, and gave birth to him. It is an extraordinary blessing - what she, and all surrogates give to families who cant have children. My surrogate has a beautiful family of her own, a wonderfully supportive husband, and kids, and I am incredibly thankful for all the support they have given Wyatt and me. My family is blessed to have this family in our lives I do wish my mom and dad and my brother, Carter, were alive to meet Wyatt, but I like to believe they can see him. I imagine them all together, arms around each other, smiling and laughing, happy to know that their love is alive in me and in Wyatt, and that our family continues\".

He was a special assistant to the President and associate director of the Office of Public Liaison, during the Trump administration.[2] He is the son of former mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani was a contributor for the conservative media channel Newsmax TV.\nIn May 2021, Giuliani announced that he would be running for governor of New York in 2022. He did not field a candidate for lieutenant governor. He went on to lose the 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary to Lee Zeldin by a significant margin.[3]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nGiuliani was born to Rudy Giuliani and Donna Hanover in 1986. He has one sister, Caroline.\nHis father was elected mayor of New York City in 1993. When his father took the oath of office, Andrew repeated parts of the oath along with his father.[4][5] Andrew was exuberant on the podium beside his father, blowing the cameras kisses, mimicking each of his father's hand gestures, and shouting: \"It should be so and it will be so!\"[6] The moment was lampooned by comedian Chris Farley on Saturday Night Live.[4][7]\nIn October 2000, his father filed for divorce, which was finalized in July 2002. His mother was awarded custody.[8][9]\nGiuliani attended Saint Joseph Regional High School in Montvale, New Jersey, graduating in 2005.[10] Giuliani studied marketing, management, and sociology at Duke University graduating in May 2009 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.[11][12] After college, Giuliani worked as a sales intern at CapRok Capital in Rye, New York.[11]\n\nGolf[edit]\nGiuliani played golf in high school, and lettered all four years. In June 2001, at 15 years of age, he played in the pro-am at the Buick Classic at the Westchester Country Club, partnered with world #1 Tiger Woods.[13] His father, Rudy Giuliani, was originally scheduled to play with Woods, but could not because of a sore left foot. Despite his inability to play, Rudy Giuliani ensured that he was present for the entire round, by either walking together with his son and Woods, or riding in a golf cart a few meters away from them to protect his left foot.[14]\nGiuliani was recruited to Duke by golf coach Rod Myers, although Myers died shortly after, and a new coach, O.D. Vincent, was appointed.[15] In February 2008, while Giuliani was a junior, he was cut from the team for breaches of discipline, which he said were minor or fabricated infractions: gunning the engine of his car as he left a parking lot, breaking a club, and throwing an apple at a teammate.[16][17][15][18][19]\nAlthough Giuliani was already cut from the team, Vincent agreed to reinstate him if the rest of the team voted for it. On April 9, 2008, five of Giuliani's teammates sent him a jointly signed email stating, \"[a]fter careful consideration we have come to the unanimous decision that we wish that your involvement with the Duke Golf Team is terminated. We have appreciated your time with us but feel that this is the best decision for all parties involved.\"[20]\nIn July 2008, Giuliani sued the university, alleging that his golf coach \"manufactured accusations against him to justify kicking him off the team to whittle the squad.\" He further claimed that the university, by way of the late Rod Myers, had already verbally promised him a spot on the Blue Devils and \u201clife-time access\u201d to Duke golf facilities.[21][22] The lawsuit was dismissed in 2010.[4][23]\nGiuliani turned pro at the beginning of 2009.[24] In August of that year he won the Metropolitan Open, earning $27,500, his first and only victory as a professional golfer.[25][26] Between 2009 and 2016, he pursued a golf career by playing on minor league tours and participating in a Golf Channel reality show.[6] In 2016, he started the process to regain his amateur status.[27][28]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nIn 2017, Giuliani was hired to work in the Trump Administration, in the Office of Public Liaison, as an Associate Director.[29] In 2019, he was promoted to Special Assistant to the President.[30][2] In his position, he helped arrange sports teams\u2019 visits to the White House, and interfaced between the White House and business, nonprofit, and other groups, meeting with President Donald Trump up to four times a week.[31][4][32] He also represented his office in White House meetings on the opioid crisis.[31] He originally had an annual salary of $77,000, which by mid-2018 had increased to $90,700, and by mid-2019 was $95,000.[30][33][31]\nGiuliani's unescorted access to the West Wing was rescinded by White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly around the beginning of June 2018.[34][35] After Kelly's departure in January 2019, Mick Mulvaney restored Giuliani's access.[30][31][33]\nGiuliani has played golf with Trump since Giuliani was a teenager.[30] Since starting work at the White House, he was a regular golf partner of Trump, and traveled with him for the sole purpose of playing a round or two of golf.[36][31] In January 2020, the Irish Times called him \"Trump's most regular playing partner\".[19]\nFrom March to May 2021, Giuliani was a contributor to Newsmax TV, hired to comment on news and politics.[37] He left that position to run for governor.[38]\nOn May 18, 2021, Giuliani formally announced his candidacy for governor of New York in the 2022 gubernatorial election.[39]\nGiuliani serves on the board of trustees of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.[40]\nOn September 24, 2021, Politico Playbook reported that Fox News had banned Giuliani and his father from appearing on air. The report was disputed by Fox News, which said Giuliani had made multiple appearances on the network since announcing his gubernatorial run.[41]\nGiuliani faced three other candidates in the 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary.[42] He was defeated by Lee Zeldin, who held a 20-point lead over Giuliani.[3]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nGiuliani was raised in the Catholic faith and was baptized by Monsignor Alan Placa in May 1986.\nIn 2010 and 2011, Giuliani dated Sarah Hughes, a competitive figure skater and Olympic gold medal winner.[43]\nIn August 2016, he announced his engagement to \u017divil\u0117 Rezgyt\u0117, a Lithuanian-born real estate account executive whom he met at Yankee Stadium.[44] They married in a Catholic ceremony at the Church of St. Joseph in Greenwich Village in Manhattan on July 14, 2017.[45]\n\nElectoral history[edit]\n\n2022 Republican gubernatorial primary results\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nLee Zeldin\n\n193,184\n\n44.1\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nAndrew Giuliani\n\n100,372\n\n22.9\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nRob Astorino\n\n80,223\n\n18.3\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nHarry Wilson\n\n64,594\n\n14.7\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n438,373 \n\n100 \n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Andrew Giuliani\".

Napolitano served as a New Jersey Superior Court judge from 1987 to 1995. He also served as a visiting professor at Widener University Delaware Law School, Seton Hall University School of Law, and Brooklyn Law School. He is a libertarian and has gained prominence in part due to his criticism the Administrations of President Trump and President Obama.[2] Beginning in 1997, he became an analyst for Fox News, commenting on legal news and trials. He has written nine books on legal and political subjects.\n\n\nEarly life and judicial and academic career[edit]\nNapolitano was born in Newark, New Jersey. He graduated with an A.B. in history from Princeton University in 1972 after completing a senior thesis titled \"An Essay on the Origin and Evolution of Representative Government in the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay, 1630-1644.\"[3] He received his J.D. from Notre Dame Law School[4] and was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1975.[citation needed] After law school, he entered private practice as a litigator. He first taught law for a brief period in 1980\u20131981 at Delaware Law School (now Widener). He sat on the New Jersey bench from 1987 to 1995, becoming the state's youngest then-sitting Superior Court judge.[5]\nNapolitano resigned his judgeship in 1995 to return to private practice. He served as an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law for 11 years, from 1989 to 2000. He served as a visiting professor at Brooklyn Law School from 2013 to 2017.[citation needed]\nNapolitano told friends in 2017 that President Donald Trump told him he was considering him for a United States Supreme Court appointment should there be a second vacancy.[6] Ultimately, Judge Brett Kavanaugh was chosen instead.\n\nMedia career[edit]\nNapolitano in 2010\nBefore joining Fox as a news analyst, Napolitano was the presiding judge for the first season of Twentieth Television's syndicated court show Power of Attorney (2000\u201302), in which people brought small-claims disputes to a televised courtroom. Differing from similar formats, the plaintiffs and defendants were represented pro bono by famous attorneys. He departed the series after its first season.\nFrom 2006 to 2010, Napolitano co-hosted a talk radio show on Fox News Radio with Brian Kilmeade titled Brian and the Judge. He hosted a daily libertarian talk show called Freedom Watch that aired on Fox Business Channel. Frequent guests on Freedom Watch were Congressman Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell and Peter Schiff. He promoted the works of Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises in his program. The show originally aired every Wednesday at 2:00\u00a0p.m. on Fox News' Strategy Room and from September 14, 2009, aired three to four times a week. On June 12, 2010, it debuted as a weekly show on Fox Business. It was one of several programs dropped in February 2012 when FBN revamped its primetime lineup.[7]\nNapolitano regularly substituted for television host Glenn Beck when Beck was absent from his program. After Beck announced that he would be leaving Fox News, he asked Napolitano to replace him.[8] He regularly provided legal analysis on top rated shows on both Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network, such as The Kelly File, The O'Reilly Factor, Varney & Co., The Fox Report with Shepard Smith, Fox & Friends and Special Report with Bret Baier until an appearance on March 16, 2017, related to a then-postulated conspiracy theory involving President Trump's accusation that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped him. On March 20, 2017, the Los Angeles Times reported that Napolitano was pulled off the air indefinitely because of the wiretapping claims;[9] however, it was unclear whether Napolitano would return to the air or whether it was just a temporary move to remove him from the news cycle.[10] He returned to the air on March 29 and stood by his claims concerning British intelligence.[11] A new book by CNN reporter Brian Stelter asserts that Attorney General William Barr met with Fox News boss Rupert Murdoch in October 2019 to request that Murdoch \"muzzle\" Napolitano and that Napolitano's Fox appearances have been limited since that meeting.[12][13]\nNapolitano was let go from his position as a contributor to Fox News in August 2021 after allegations of sexual harassment filed by a Fox Business production assistant.[14][15]  During his 24-year tenure as Fox News' Senior Judicial Analyst, Napolitano appeared on air more than 14,500 times,[16][17] a record for any on-air personality at the network.[citation needed]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nThis article is part of a series onLibertarianismin the United States\nSchools\nAgorism\nAnarcho-capitalism\nAustro\nAutarchism\nBleeding-heart\nChristian\nConsequentialist\nFeminist\nFusionism\nGeo\nGreen\nLeft-wing market anarchism\nMinarchism\nNatural-rights\nNeo\nPaleo\nPanarchism\nPaternalist\nPropertarianism\nTechno\nTranshumanist\nVoluntaryism\n\nPrinciples\nAnti-imperialism\nCivil libertarianism\nConstitutionalism\nCounter-economics\nDecentralization\nDeparturism\nEconomic freedom\nEvictionism\nFree banking\nFree market\nFree-market environmentalism\nFree migration\nFree trade\nFree will\nFreedom of association\nFreedom of contract\nFreedom of speech\nHomestead principle\nIndividuality\nIndividualism\nLiberty\nLimited government\nLocalism\nMarriage privatization\nNatural rights and legal rights\nNon-aggression principle\nNon-interventionism\nNon-politics\nNon-voting\nOpen border\nPolycentric law\nPrivate defense agency\nPrivate property\nPublic choice theory\nRestorative justice\nRight to bear arms\nRugged Individualism\nSelf-ownership\nSingle tax\nSmall government\nSpontaneous order\nStateless society\nTax resistance\nTitle-transfer theory of contract\nVoluntary association\nVoluntary society\n\nHistory\nAge of Enlightenment\nAbolitionism in the United States\nClassical liberalism\nAnti-Federalism\nTranscendentalism\nIndividualist anarchism in the United States\nOld Right\nNew Left\nFreedom School\n\nEconomics\nAustrian School\nEconomic liberalism\nFiscal conservatism\nGeorgism\nLaissez-faire\nNeoliberalism\nSupply-side economics\n\nPeople\nAmash\nAndrews\nBarnett\nBlock\nBrennan\nBurt\nChamberlain\nCaplan\nCarson\nChartier\nChodorov\nChomsky\nCleveland\nCoolidge\nEpstein\nD.

He believes the Supreme Court's ruling on interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia (1967) set a precedent that would also require state recognition of same-sex marriage.[19] He opposes capital punishment, saying, \"I don't believe that the state has the moral authority to execute.\"[20] He is a believer in the separation of Church and State.\nWith respect to both presidents Bush and Obama and their handling of civil liberties in the War on Terror, Napolitano is a strong critic. In both his scholarly work, appearing in the New York University School of Law Journal of Law and Liberty, and in his book Suicide Pact, he criticized the actions of both presidents and their parties concerning torture, domestic spying, unilateral executive action and encroachments on political power.\nIn February 2014, Napolitano expressed disdain for Abraham Lincoln on Fox News, saying, \"I am a contrarian on Abraham Lincoln.\" Slavery in the U.S., according to Napolitano, while one of the most deplorable institutions in human history, could have been done away with peacefully, sparing the bloodiest conflict in American history. At the same time, he also argued that states, where slavery was legal, did not secede out of fear of abolitionism, asserting that \"largely the impetus for secession was tariffs,\" which most Civil War historians dispute.[21] In his book Suicide Pact, he focused his criticism of Lincoln on the precedent set by his specific constitutional violations, such as his unilateral suspension of the right to habeas corpus and his institutionalization of military commission systems for civilian crimes.\nAfter the release of the Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, Napolitano said the report showed that Trump engaged in numerous instances of obstruction of justice. However, the report deliberately refused to make a firm conclusion about obstruction of justice accusations.[22]\nAccording to The New York Times, Napolitano \"has a taste for conspiracy theories\".[23] The Washington Post has described him as a \"purveyor of conspiracy theories.\"[24]\nNapolitano has promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories. In 2010, he said, \"It's hard for me to believe that it  (7 World Trade Center) came down by itself... I am gratified to see that people across the board are interested. I think twenty years from now, people will look at 9/11 the way we look at the assassination of JFK today. It couldn't possibly have been done the way the government told us.\"[25][26]\n\nJudicial philosophy[edit]\nNapolitano subscribes to a natural law jurisprudence that is influenced by a respect for originalist ideas and methods. He has expressed strong sympathies with the Randy Barnett new originalist vein of originalism, as it incorporates the natural law through an original understanding of the Ninth Amendment. He has published a favorable column on Barnett's idea of a constitutional presumption of liberty.[27]\nNapolitano's philosophy generally leans towards strong originalism while not accepting the limitations of the older types of originalism espoused by Robert Bork and Justice Antonin Scalia concerning the Constitution's open-ended provisions like the Ninth Amendment. He finds such limitations too restrictive on a judge's ability to apply the natural law to decide cases where the individual's liberty is at stake. He is a strong believer in economic liberties. He argues that Lochner v. New York was overruled in error in the West Coast Hotel case, as the Contracts Clause and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process clauses protect a sphere of personal economic liberty.[28]\nIn September 2015, Napolitano was the featured speaker at a conference held by the Republican government watchdog group Judicial Watch.[29]\n\nAllegations that British intelligence wiretapped Trump Tower[edit]\nFurther information: Trump Tower wiretapping allegations\nOn March 16, 2017, citing three unnamed intelligence sources, Napolitano said on the program Fox & Friends that Britain's top intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), had engaged in covert electronic surveillance of then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign on orders from President Obama.[23] He said that by using the British intelligence apparatus, Obama would avoid leaving \"fingerprints\" that could identify the origin of this surveillance action.\nIn response to \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host Brian Kilmead stating that Napolitano was claiming Trump's phone was \u201cwiretapped\u201d, Napolitano denied actual physical tampering, instead citing the agency has digital access to digital information.\nIn a column on the Fox website, he wrote that GCHQ \"most likely provided Obama with transcripts of Trump's calls. The NSA has given GCHQ full 24/7 access to its computers, so GCHQ \u2014 a foreign intelligence agency that, like the NSA, operates outside our constitutional norms \u2014 has the digital versions of all electronic communications made in America in 2016, including Trump's.\"[30] One of his sources was former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer Larry C. Johnson, who later told CNN that Napolitano had misrepresented the statements he made on an online discussion board. Johnson, citing two anonymous sources, claimed that the GCHQ was passing information on the Trump campaign to U.S. intelligence through a \"back-channel\", but stressed that the GCHQ did not \"wiretap\" Trump or his associates and that alleged information sharing by the GCHQ was not done at the direction of the Obama administration.[31][32]\nOn March 16, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer repeated Napolitano's claim at a White House press briefing. The following day, GCHQ responded with a rare public statement: \"Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct 'wiretapping' against the then president-elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.\"[33] A British government source said the allegation was \"totally untrue and quite frankly absurd\".[34] Admiral Michael S. Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, said he has seen nothing to suggest that there was \"any such activity,\" nor any request to do so.[35] Former GCHQ director David Omand told the Financial Times that \"The suggestion that [Barack Obama] asked GCHQ to spy on Trump is just completely barking\u2014that would be evident to anyone who knew the system.\"[36]\nThe claim started a diplomatic dispute with Britain. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader in Britain, said, \"Trump is compromising the vital UK\u2013US security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment. This harms our and US security.\"[34] The Telegraph said that two U.S. officials had personally apologized for the allegation.[34] The British government also said that the U.S. government promised not to repeat these claims.[36][37] The White House denied reports that it had apologized to the British government, saying Spicer was merely \"pointing to public reports\" without endorsing them.[34][38]\nOn April 12, 2017, The Guardian reported that GCHQ and other European intelligence agencies had intercepted communications between members of the Trump campaign team and Russian officials and shared the intelligence with their U.S. counterparts. The communications were obtained through \"incidental collection\" as part of routine surveillance of Russian intelligence assets, not from a targeted operation against Trump or his campaign.[39][40]\nFox News distanced itself from Napolitano's claims and suspended him from contributing to the network's output, according to the Los Angeles Times and the Associated Press.[41] He returned on March 29 after a nearly two-week absence, but continued to support his earlier claims.[42]\n\nCivil War views[edit]\nNapolitano has made numerous claims about the Civil War which are rejected by historians. These claims include that the Civil War was Abraham Lincoln's war by choice, that slavery was dying anyway, that Lincoln could have freed the slaves by paying the slaveholders, and that Lincoln armed the slaves.[43][44]\u00a0More specifically, in a Daily Show segment, he said that Lincoln started the war \"because he wanted to preserve the union, because he needed the tariffs from the southern states,\" a claim rejected by a panel of three distinguished historians of the Civil War: James Oakes, Eric Foner and Manisha Sinha.[44] Napolitano argued that Lincoln could have solved the slavery question by paying slaveholders to release their slaves, a method known as compensated emancipation, thereby avoiding war.[43] Lincoln did offer to pay to free the slaves in Delaware, but the Delaware legislature rejected him.[43] He also asserted that Lincoln attempted to arm slaves, but two prominent historians of the Civil War said they had never heard of such an effort and PolitiFact rated the claim \"pants-on-fire\".[43][45] He has asserted that slavery was dying a natural death at the time of the Civil War, a claim that Eric Foner on the Daily Show panel rejected. Foner said, \"Slavery was not only viable, it was growing ... This idea that it was dying out or was going to die out is ridiculous.\"[44]\nNapolitano has also said that Lincoln enforced the Fugitive Slave Act \"until the Civil War was over\" by sending escaped slaves back to their owners. PolitiFact notes that \"while there were cases when Lincoln enforced the law during the Civil War, he did so selectively when he thought it would help keep border states in the Union fold. When it came to slaves from Confederate states, the weight of the government actions fell heavily on the side of refusing to return escaped slaves.\" Furthermore, his claim that Lincoln enforced the act \"until the Civil War was over\" was indisputably false, as the Fugitive Slave Act was repealed in June 1864, more than ten months before the end of the war.[43]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nNapolitano splits his time living in Manhattan and Newton, New Jersey, where he owns a farm that produces maple syrup.[46]\nNapolitano has stated that he is not related to former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, whom he sometimes jokingly calls \"Evil Cousin Janet\".[47][48]\nNapolitano is a vegetarian.[49]\nNapolitano identifies as a Traditionalist Catholic who is opposed to the reforms of Vatican II and is critical of Pope Francis.[50][51]\nNapolitano was sued by two New Jersey men alleging sexual assault dating, in one case, to his time on the bench.[52] Napolitano countersued in one case bringing a libel case. All three suits were later withdrawn and it is reportedly unclear whether any financial settlement occurred.[53]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nBooks[edit]\nConstitutional Chaos: What Happens When the Government Breaks its Own Laws (2004) ISBN\u00a0978-0785260837.\nThe Constitution in Exile: How the Federal Government Has Seized Power by Rewriting the Supreme Law of the Land (2006) ISBN\u00a0978-1595550705\nA Nation of Sheep (2007) ISBN\u00a0978-1595551924.\nDred Scott's Revenge: A Legal History of Race and Freedom in America (2009) ISBN\u00a0978-1418575571.\nLies the Government Told You: Myth, Power, and Deception in American History (2010) ISBN\u00a0978-1418584245.\nIt is Dangerous to be Right When the Government is Wrong: The Case for Personal Freedom (2011) ISBN\u00a0978-1595554130.\nTheodore and Woodrow: How Two American Presidents Destroyed Constitutional Freedom (2012) ISBN\u00a0978-1595554215.\nThe Freedom Answer Book: How the Government Is Taking Away Your Constitutional Freedoms (2013) ISBN\u00a0978-1400320295.\nSuicide Pact: The Radical Expansion of Presidential Powers and the Lethal Threat to American Liberty (2014) ISBN\u00a0978-0718021931.\nBook contributions[edit]\n\"Introduction.\" In: Shattered Dreams: 100 Stories of Government Abuse.
