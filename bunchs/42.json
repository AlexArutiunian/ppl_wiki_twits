Her research focuses on the development and implementation of interventions to support the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ individuals and communities.[1] Israel has presented about dialogue across political lines[2] and is the author of Beyond Your Bubble: How to Connect Across the Political Divide, Skills and Strategies for Conversations That Work (American Psychological Association, 2020).[3][4] She is also known for writing song lyrics,[5] memoir,[6] and bisexual haiku.[7]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nIsrael was born in Pomona, California to a Chinese-American mother and Jewish-American father, and she grew up in Charlottesville, Virginia.[1] In 1988, she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) with a double major in Psychology and Women's Studies after having been exposed to intersectional feminism by Michelle Fine.[1]\nAfter graduating, Israel worked at the Cherry Hill Women's Center in New Jersey and then oversaw AIDS education programs at the American Red Cross of Southeastern Pennsylvania.[1] Israel returned to Penn and received a master's degree in Human Sexuality Education in 1992.[1] She earned her Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from Arizona State University in 1998,[1] receiving awards for her dissertation on training counselors to work with LGB clients.[8][9]\n\nAcademic career[edit]\nIsrael has been a professor at the Gevirtz School's Department of Counseling, Clinical, and School Psychology (CCSP) since 2000[1] where she became the Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in 2022.[10] She is also an affiliated faculty member in UCSB's Department of Feminist Studies.[11]\nIsrael is the director of Project RISE (Research & Interventions for Sexual and Gender Minority Empowerment).[12] Projects include online interventions that help LGBTQ people persevere in the face of stigmas[13] and effective LGBTQ-inclusive training for law enforcement[14] and therapists.[15] The local LGBTQ community research her team conducted in collaboration with Santa Barbara nonprofits resulted in a mandatory LGBTQ-focused training for City of Santa Barbara police officers.[16] The training sessions fostered awareness and better understanding of LGBTQ needs and concerns and were found to improve LGBTQ community-police relations.[17] In 2013, Israel testified at a U.S. Congressional briefing, speaking in support of expanding the Violence Against Women Act to include LGBTQ women's needs.[18]\nShe is recognized as an expert on bisexuality,[19] having participated in the inaugural White House Bisexual Community Policy Briefing in 2015,[1] presented at the 2019 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Bisexual Health Research Workshop,[20] and presented an invited plenary on bisexuality at the 2016 American Psychological Association Annual Convention.[21] Israel's 2015 TEDxUCLA Talk, \u201cBisexuality and beyond,\u201d has amassed over 100,000 views on YouTube as of May 2021.[22]\nIsrael's book, Beyond Your Bubble: How to Connect Across the Political Divide, Skills and Strategies for Conversations That Work, grew out of a workshop[3] that she provided to non-profit and faith organizations.[16] She aims to help people articulate their thoughts about difficult issues and facilitate understanding between people from different political backgrounds.[23] In her 2021, TEDx Talk \u201cHow to Win a Political Disagreement,\u201d[24] she asserted that \u201cwinning an argument is not about asserting one's position, but rather about strengthening a connection.\u201d In her 2023, TEDxTalk \u201cWhat Halibut Fajitas Taught Me About Bridging the Political Divide\u201d[25] she described biases that narrow our view and noted that \u201ca single perspective is limiting.\u201d\nIsrael's professional leadership includes President of the Society of Counseling Psychology,[3]  Lead Coordinator for the 2009 National Multicultural Conference and Summit,[26] and member of the American Psychological Association Committee on Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity.[27]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\n2021 Next Generation Indy Book Awards Winner in Self Help and Finalist in General Non-Fiction (for

Board[41] (of which she was the president in 2013), the Lose Your Appetite for Hate Coalition,[42] and the Santa Barbara County Commission for Women.[43]\n\nCreative activities[edit]\nIsrael writes

He is the author of multiple books, including the 2019 book Infiltration: The Plot to Destroy the Church from Within.\nIn 2023, Marshall announced he was running as a candidate in the 2024 United States presidential election.[2]\n\n\nEducation and priesthood[edit]\nMarshall graduated magna cum laude from Texas A&M University in 2000 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy.[3] After studying at Westminster Theological Seminary and Nashotah House, Marshall was ordained a priest of the Episcopal Church in 2005 by Jack Iker, the Bishop of Fort Worth.[4][5] Marshall had previously served as a youth minister at Saint Andrew's Episcopal Church while an Episcopal deacon.[6]\nShortly thereafter, in 2006, he and his wife converted to Catholicism.[7] In 2009 Marshall earned his Master of Arts degree in philosophy, and in 2011 earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in philosophy, at the University of Dallas.[3][8]\n\nPost-conversion career[edit]\nFrom January 2012 until June 2013, Marshall served as the chancellor of the former College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More.[9][10] Prior to his administrative work at the college, he was a professor of philosophy. Marshall also formerly served as the assistant director of the Archdiocese of Washington's Catholic Information Center.[3] He is a founder of the New Saint Thomas Institute, an online Catholic theology educational program, and the Troops of Saint George, a Catholic scouting organization.[11][12]\nMarshall has published books in the fields of theology, philosophy, and historical fiction.[13] All but one have been self-published by Saint John Press and Media, a company held and managed by Marshall.[14][15] His 2019 book, Infiltration, claims to demonstrate that, over the last two centuries, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church has been actively subverted to promote Freemasonic power.[16] The foreword of the book was written by Bishop Athanasius Schneider. The book has been controversial in Catholic circles, drawing both positive and negative reviews from various media outlets.[17][18] Marshall, on his YouTube channel, regularly comments on statements from Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, former Nuncio to the United States.[19]\nIn October 2019, Marshall received media attention for publicizing an incident at the Catholic Church's Amazon Synod in which Alexander Tschugguel and an accomplice filmed themselves removing indigenous fertility statues, reportedly of Pachamama, from the Church of Santa Maria in Traspontina in Rome and throwing them into the Tiber river.[20][21] In March 2020, it was revealed that Marshall himself had personally funded Tschugguel's trip to Rome and uploaded the video of the theft.[22]\nMarshall briefly received attention from Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign for popularizing Archbishop Vigan\u00f2's letter warning of a deep state working to undermine the United States of America.[16] Marshall was noticed by the campaign in return, and retweeted on the president's Twitter account.[23] Traditionalist Catholic writer Matthew Walther criticized both Marshall's advocacy for then-President Trump and his claims against Pope Francis. Walther accused Marshall of \"distorting or simply lying\" about the pope in order to anger Catholics.[24]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMarshall met his wife, Joy McPherson, in 1999. They were married on June 9, 2001, at Saint Andrew's Episcopal Church in Fort Worth, Texas. They have eight children.[25] Marshall and his family converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism. They received confirmation from Bishop Kevin Vann in May 2006.[26][27]\n\nBooks[edit]\nWith the exception of Infiltration, Marshall's books are self-published under the imprint of Saint John Press and Media, a company held and managed by Marshall.\n\nThe Origins of Catholicism trilogy\nThe Crucified Rabbi: Judaism and the Origins of Catholic Christianity (Saint John Press, 2009)\nThe Catholic Perspective on Paul: Paul and the Origins of Catholic Christianity (Saint John Press, 2010)\nThe Eternal City: Rome & the Origins of Catholic Christianity (Saint John Press, 2012)\nThomas Aquinas in 50 Pages: A Layman's Quick Guide to Thomism (Saint John Press, 2014)\nThe Sword and Serpent trilogy\nSword and Serpent (Saint John Press, 2014)\nThe Tenth Region of the Night (Saint John Press, 2016)\nStorm of Fire and Blood (Saint John Press, 2017)\nSaint Augustine in 50 Pages: The Layman's Quick Guide to Augustinianism (Saint John Press, 2015)\nInfiltration: The Plot to Destroy the Church from Within (Sophia Institute Press, 2019)\nThe Rosary in 50 Pages: The Layman's Quick Guide to Mary's Psalter (Saint John Press, 2020)\nAntichrist and Apocalypse: The 21 Prophecies of Revelation Unveiled and Described (Saint John Press, 2022)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Nadeau, Barbie Latza (August 16, 2020). \"The Secret Society of Priests Who Hate Pope Francis\".

He co-founded and edited The Baffler magazine. Frank is the author of the books What's the Matter with Kansas? (2004) and Listen, Liberal (2016), among others. From 2008 to 2010 he wrote \"The Tilting Yard\", a column in The Wall Street Journal.\nA historian of culture and ideas, Frank analyzes trends in American electoral politics and propaganda, advertising, popular culture, mainstream journalism, and economics. His topics include the rhetoric and impact of culture wars in American political life and the relationship between politics, economics, and culture in the United States.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nFrank was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and grew up in Mission Hills, Kansas. He graduated from Shawnee Mission East High School, and in 1988 from the University of Virginia with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history after transferring from the University of Kansas in his freshman year. Frank received a Master of Arts degree in history in 1990 and a doctorate in history in 1994 from the University of Chicago. His doctoral thesis on advertising in the 1960s, The Conquest of Cool: Business Culture, Counterculture, and the Rise of Hip Consumerism, was later published by the University of Chicago Press.[1]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nFrank was a College Republican, attending campus meetings at the University of Kansas, but became highly critical of conservatism. He summarized the thesis of his 2008 book The Wrecking Crew (book) as \"[b]ad government is the natural product of rule by those who believe government is bad.\"[2]\nFrank's other writings include essays for Harper's Magazine, Le Monde diplomatique, Bookforum, and the Financial Times. His book What's the Matter with Kansas? (2004) earned him nationwide and international recognition. In October 2005, Frank received the Eugene Debs Award for his work in the field of social justice.[3]\nFrom December 2010 to February 2014, Frank wrote the monthly \"Easy Chair\" column for Harper's Magazine.[4]\nFrank identifies as a left-wing populist and supported Bernie Sanders's 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns.\nIn Listen, Liberal: Or, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People? (2016), Frank was one of the few analysts who foresaw that Donald Trump could win the 2016 United States presidential election.[5] In 2018, he called Trump \"the worst politician ever\", but maintained that Trump could be reelected in the 2020 presidential election. Frank further observes that \"quasi-fascist movements\" are springing up around the world.[6]\nFrank's research into U.S. populism was published as the book The People, No: A Brief History of Anti-Populism (2020). In it, he examines the origin of the term in the United States and discusses historical examples of populism and its adherents and detractors.[7]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nFrank lives in Bethesda, Maryland, with his wife, Wendy Edelberg, and their children.\n\nWorks[edit]\nBooks[edit]\nExternal videos Presentation by Frank on One Market Under Ground, March 9, 2001, C-SPAN Presentation by Frank on What's the Matter With Kansas?', June 14, 2004, C-SPAN Washington Journal interview with Frank on What's the Matter With Kansas?, November 9, 2004, C-SPAN Presentation by Frank on What's the Matter With Kansas?, December 6, 2004, C-SPAN After Words interview with Frank on The Wrecking Crew, August 23, 2008, C-SPAN Presentation by Frank on Pity the Billionaire, January 6, 2012, C-SPAN Presentation by Frank on Pity the Billionaire, October 27, 2012, C-SPAN Presentation by Frank on Listen Liberal, March 15, 2016, C-SPAN Presentation by Frank on Listen Liberal, June 11, 2016, C-SPAN Presentation by Frank on Rendezvous with Oblivion, June 27, 2018, C-SPAN\nFrank, Thomas (1997).

He is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.[1][2] With widely published commentary and books\u2014and as a guest on TV and radio\u2014he became a well-known voice in the American conservative movement as a prominent black conservative.[3][4][5] He was a recipient of the National Humanities Medal from President George W. Bush in 2002.[6][a]\nSowell was born in segregated Gastonia, North Carolina, to a poor family, and grew up in Harlem, New York City.[7] Due to poverty and difficulties at home, he dropped out of Stuyvesant High School and worked various odd jobs, eventually serving in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War. Afterward, he took night classes at Howard University and then attended Harvard University, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1958.[7] He earned a master's degree in economics from Columbia University the next year and a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago in 1968.[8] In his academic career, he has served on the faculties of Cornell University, Amherst College, Brandeis University, and the University of California, Los Angeles. He has also worked at think tanks including the Urban Institute. Since 1977, he has worked at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where he is the Rose and Milton Friedman Senior Fellow on Public Policy.\nSowell was an important figure to the conservative movement during the Reagan era, influencing fellow economist Walter E. Williams and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.[3][9][10] He was offered a position as Federal Trade Commissioner in the Ford administration,[11] and was considered for posts including U.S. Secretary of Education in the Reagan administration,[12] but declined both times.[11][13]\nSowell is the author of more than 45 books (including revised and new editions) on a variety of subjects including politics, economics, education and race, and he has been a syndicated columnist in more than 150 newspapers.[14][15] His views are described as conservative, especially on social issues;[4][16][17][18] libertarian, especially on economics;[16][19][20] or libertarian-conservative.[21] He has said he may be best labeled as a libertarian, though he disagrees with libertarians on some issues, such as national defense.[22]\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nSowell was born in 1930 into a poor family in segregated Gastonia, North Carolina.[7][23] His father died shortly before he was born, leaving behind Sowell's mother, a housemaid who already had four children. A great-aunt and her two grown daughters adopted Sowell and raised him.[7] His mother died a few years later of complications while giving birth to another child.[24] In his autobiography, A Personal Odyssey, Sowell wrote that his childhood encounters with white people were so limited that he did not know blond was a hair color.[25] He recalls that his first memories were living in a small wooden house in Charlotte, North Carolina, which he stated was typical of most black neighborhoods.[24] It was located on an unpaved street and had no electricity or running water.[24] When Sowell was nine years old, he and his extended family moved from North Carolina to Harlem, New York City, for greater opportunities, joining in the large-scale trend of African-American migration from the American south to the north. Family quarrels forced him and his aunt to room in other people's apartments.[24]\nSowell qualified for Stuyvesant High School, a prestigious academic high school in New York City; he was the first in his family to study beyond the sixth grade. However, he was forced to drop out at age 17 because of financial difficulties and family quarreling.[7] He worked a number of odd jobs, including long hours at a machine shop, and as a delivery man for Western Union.[26] He also tried out for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1948.[27] Sowell was drafted into the armed services in 1951 during the Korean War and was assigned to the U.S. Marine Corps. Although Sowell opposed the war and experienced racism, he was able to find fulfillment as a photographer, which eventually became his favorite hobby.[7][24] He was honorably discharged in 1952.[24]\n\nHigher education and early career[edit]\nAfter leaving military service, Sowell completed high school, took a civil service job in Washington, DC, and attended night classes at Howard University, a historically black college.[28][29] His high scores on the College Board exams and recommendations by two professors helped him gain admission to Harvard University, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.[7][30] He earned a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University the following year.[30] Sowell had initially chosen Columbia University to study under George Stigler, who would later receive the Nobel Prize in Economics, but when he learned that Stigler had moved to the University of Chicago, he followed him there and studied for his doctorate under Stigler upon arriving in the fall of 1959.[31]\nSowell has said that he was a Marxist \"during the decade of my 20s\". One of his earliest professional publications was a sympathetic examination of Marxist thought vs. Marxist\u2013Leninist practice.[32] What began to change his mind toward supporting free market economics, he said, was studying the possible impact of minimum wages on unemployment of sugar industry workers in Puerto Rico, as a U.S. Department of Labor intern. Workers at the department were surprised by his questioning, he said, and he concluded that \"they certainly weren't going to engage in any scrutiny of the law\".[22]\nSowell received his Doctor of Philosophy in economics from the University of Chicago in 1968.[30] His dissertation was titled \"Say's Law and the General Glut Controversy\".[33]\n\nAcademic career[edit]\nFrom 1965 to 1969, Sowell was an assistant professor of economics at Cornell University. Writing 30 years later about the 1969 seizure of Willard Straight Hall by black students at Cornell, Sowell characterized the students as \"hoodlums\" with \"serious academic problems [who were] admitted under lower academic standards\", and noted \"it so happens that the pervasive racism that black students supposedly encountered at every turn on campus and in town was not apparent to me during the four years that I taught at Cornell and lived in Ithaca.\"[34]\nSowell has taught economics at Howard University, Rutgers, Cornell, Brandeis University, Amherst College, and the University of California, Los Angeles.[28] At Howard, Sowell wrote, he was offered the position as head of the economics department, but he declined.[35] Since 1980, he has been a Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where he holds a fellowship named after Rose and Milton Friedman, his mentor.[30][36] The Hoover appointment, because it did not involve teaching, gave him more time for his numerous writings.[12] In addition, Sowell appeared several times on William F. Buckley Jr.'s show Firing Line, during which he discussed the economics of race and privatization. Sowell has written that he gradually lost faith in the academic system, citing low academic standards and counterproductive university bureaucracy, and he resolved to leave teaching after his time at the University of California, Los Angeles.[35] In A Personal Odyssey, he recounts, \"I had come to Amherst, basically, to find reasons to continue teaching. What I found instead were more reasons to abandon an academic career.\"[35]\nIn an interview, Sowell said he had been offered a position as Federal Trade Commissioner by the Ford administration in 1976, but that after pursuing the opportunity, he withdrew from consideration to avoid the political games surrounding the position.[11] He said in another interview that he was offered the post of United States Secretary of Education but declined.[13] In 1980, after Reagan's election, Sowell and Henry Lucas organized the Black Alternatives Conference to bring together black and white conservatives; one attendee was a young Clarence Thomas, then a congressional aide.[37][38] Sowell was appointed as a member of the Economic Policy Advisory Committee of the Reagan administration,[39] but resigned after the first meeting, disliking travel from the West Coast and lengthy discussions in Washington; of his decision to resign, Sowell cited \"the opinion (and the example) of Milton Friedman, that some individuals can contribute more by staying out of government\".[40]\nIn 1987, Sowell testified in favor of federal appeals court judge Robert Bork during the hearings for Bork's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. In his testimony, Sowell said that Bork was \"the most highly qualified nominee of this generation\" and that what he viewed as judicial activism, a concept that Bork opposed as a self-described originalist and textualist, \"has not been beneficial to minorities.\"[41]\nIn a review of Sowell's 1987 book, A Conflict of Visions, Larry D. Nachman in Commentary magazine described Sowell as a leading representative of the Chicago school of economics.[42]\n\nWritings and thought[edit]\nThemes of Sowell's writing range from social policy on race, ethnic groups, education, and decision-making, to classical and Marxian economics, to the problems of children perceived as having disabilities.\nSowell had a nationally syndicated column distributed by Creators Syndicate that was published in Forbes magazine, National Review, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, The New York Post, and other major newspapers, as well as online on websites such as RealClearPolitics, Townhall, WorldNetDaily, and the Jewish World Review.[43] Sowell commented on current issues, which include liberal media bias;[44] judicial activism and originalism;[45] abortion;[46] minimum wage; universal health care; the tension between government policies, programs, and protections and familial autonomy; affirmative action; government bureaucracy;[47] gun control;[48] militancy in U.S. foreign policy; the war on drugs; multiculturalism;[49] mob rule and the overturning of Roe v. Wade.[50] According to The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, Sowell was the most cited black economist between 1991 and 1995, and second most cited between 1971 and 1990.[2][b]\nHe was a frequent guest on The Rush Limbaugh Show, in conversations with Walter E. Williams, who was a substitute host for Limbaugh.[16]\nOn December 27, 2016, Sowell announced the end of his syndicated column, writing that, at age 86, \"the question is not why I am quitting, but why I kept at it so long\", and cited a desire to focus on his photography hobby.[15]\nThe TV show Free to Choose, distributed by the Free to Choose Network, features Sowell along with Milton Friedman and a number of other panelists as they discuss the relationship between freedom and individual economic choices.[51][52] A documentary detailing his career entitled \"Thomas Sowell: Common Sense in a Senseless World\" was released by the Free to Choose Network in 2021.[53][54]\n\nEconomic and political ideology[edit]\nUntil the spring of 1972, Sowell was a registered Democrat, after which he then left the Democratic Party and resolved not to associate with any political party again, stating \"I was so disgusted with both candidates that I didn't vote at all.\"[11] Though he is often described as a black conservative, Sowell said, \"I prefer not to have labels, but I suspect that 'libertarian' would suit me better than many others, although I disagree with the libertarian movement on a number of things.\"[22] He has been described as one of the most prominent advocates of contemporary classical liberalism along with Friedrich Hayek and Larry Arnhart.[55] Sowell primarily writes on economic subjects, generally advocating a free market approach to capitalism.[56] Sowell opposes the Federal Reserve, arguing that it has been unsuccessful in preventing economic depressions and limiting inflation.[57] Sowell described his study of Karl Marx in his autobiography; as a former Marxist who early in his career became disillusioned with it, he emphatically opposes Marxism, providing a critique in his book Marxism: Philosophy and Economics (1985).\nSowell has also written a trilogy of books on ideologies and political positions, including A Conflict of Visions, in which he speaks on the origins of political strife; The Vision of the Anointed, in which he compares the conservative/libertarian and liberal/progressive worldviews; and The Quest for Cosmic Justice, in which, as in many of his other writings, he outlines his thesis of the need felt by intellectuals, politicians, and leaders to fix and perfect the world in utopian and ultimately, he posits, disastrous fashions. Separate from the trilogy, but also in discussion of the subject, he wrote Intellectuals and Society, building on his earlier work, in which he discusses what he argues to be the blind hubris and follies of intellectuals in a variety of areas.\nHis book Knowledge and Decisions, a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics Center Prize, was heralded as a \"landmark work,\" selected for this prize \"because of its cogent contribution to our understanding of the differences between the market process and the process of government.\" In announcing the award, the centre acclaimed Sowell, whose \"contribution to our understanding of the process of regulation alone would make the book important, but in reemphasizing the diversity and efficiency that the market makes possible, [his] work goes deeper and becomes even more significant.\"[58] Friedrich Hayek wrote: \"In a wholly original manner [Sowell] succeeds in translating abstract and theoretical argument into highly concrete and realistic discussion of the central problems of contemporary economic policy.\"[59]\nSowell opposes the imposition of minimum wages by governments, arguing in his book Basic Economics that \"Unfortunately, the real minimum wage is always zero, regardless of the laws, and that is the wage that many workers receive in the wake of the creation or escalation of a government-mandated minimum wage, because they either lose their jobs or fail to find jobs when they enter the labor force.\"[60] He goes further to argue that minimum wages disproportionately affect \"members of racial or ethnic minority groups\" that have been discriminated against. He asserts that \"Before federal minimum wage laws were instituted in the 1930s, the black unemployment rate was slightly lower than the white unemployment rate in 1930. But then followed the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 \u2013 all of which imposed government-mandated minimum wages, either on a particular sector or more broadly... By 1954, black unemployment rates were double those of whites and have continued to be at that level or higher. Those particularly hard hit by the resulting unemployment have been black teenage males.\"[61]\nSowell also favors decriminalization of all drugs.[62] He opposes gun control laws, arguing, \"On net balance, they do not save lives, but cost lives.\"[48]\n\nRace and ethnicity[edit]\nSowell has supported conservative political positions on race, and is known for caustic, sarcastic criticism of liberal black civil rights figures.[63][5] Sowell has argued that systemic racism is an untested, questionable hypothesis, writing, \"I don't think even the people who use it have any clear idea what they're saying\", and compared it to propaganda tactics used by Joseph Goebbels because if it is \"repeated long enough and loud enough\", people \"cave in\" to it.[64][65]\nIn several of his works\u2014including The Economics and Politics of Race (1983), Ethnic America (1981), Affirmative Action Around the World (2004), and other books\u2014Sowell challenges the notion that black progress is due to progressive government programs or policies. He claims that many problems identified with blacks in modern society are not unique, neither in terms of American ethnic groups, nor in terms of a rural proletariat struggling with disruption as it became urbanized, as discussed in his Black Rednecks and White Liberals (2005).[66] He is critical of affirmative action and race-based quotas.[67][68]\n\nWhen people get used to preferential treatment, equal treatment seems like discrimination.[69]\nHe takes issue with the notion of government as a helper or savior of minorities, arguing that the historical record shows quite the opposite. In Affirmative Action Around the World,[70] Sowell holds that affirmative action affects more groups than is commonly understood, though its impacts occur through different mechanisms, and has long since ceased to favor blacks.One of the few policies that can be said to harm virtually every group in a different way. ... Obviously, whites and Asians lose out when you have preferential admission for black students or Hispanic students\u2014but blacks and Hispanics lose out because what typically happens is the students who have all the credentials to succeed in college are admitted to colleges where the standards are so much higher that they fail.[71]\nIn Intellectuals and Race (2013), Sowell argues that intelligence quotient (IQ) gaps are hardly startling or unusual between, or within, ethnic groups. He notes that the roughly 15-point gap in contemporary black\u2013white IQ scores is similar to that between the national average and the scores of certain ethnic white groups in years past, in periods when the nation was absorbing new immigrants.[72]\n\nLate-talking and the Einstein syndrome[edit]\nSowell wrote The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late, a follow-up to his Late-Talking Children, discussing a condition he termed the Einstein syndrome. This book investigates the phenomenon of late-talking children, frequently misdiagnosed with autism or pervasive developmental disorder. He includes the research of Stephen Camarata and Steven Pinker, among others, in this overview of a poorly understood developmental trait. It is a trait which he says affected many historical figures who developed prominent careers, such as physicists Albert Einstein,[73] Edward Teller, and Richard Feynman; mathematician Julia Robinson; and musicians Arthur Rubinstein and Clara Schumann. He makes the case for the theory that some children develop unevenly (asynchronous development) for a period in childhood due to rapid and extraordinary development in the analytical functions of the brain. This may temporarily \"rob resources\" from neighboring functions such as language development.\n\nPolitics[edit]\nIn a 2009 column titled \"The Bush Legacy\", Sowell assessed President George W. Bush as \"a mixed bag\" but \"an honorable man.\"[74] Sowell was strongly critical of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and grudgingly endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, criticizing  him as well, and stating that \"we can only make our choices among those actually available\".[75] Sowell indicated that he would vote in the general election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, due to fears about the appointments Clinton would possibly make to the Supreme Court.[citation needed]\nSowell said the media was \"filtering and spinning\" its coverage regarding abortions[76] and has spoken out against sex-selective abortion.[77] In 2018, he named George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan, and Calvin Coolidge as presidents he liked.[78]\n\nDonald Trump[edit]\nDuring the Republican primary of the 2016 presidential election, Sowell criticized Donald Trump, questioning whether Trump had \"any principles at all, other than promoting Donald Trump?\"[79] Two weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Sowell recommended voters to vote for Trump over Hillary Clinton, because he would be \"easier to impeach\".[80] In 2018, when asked on his thoughts of Trump's presidency, Sowell replied, \"I think he's better than the previous president.\"[17]\nDuring interviews in 2019, Sowell defended President Trump against charges of racism.[81][82]\n\nJoe Biden presidential nomination[edit]\nIn 2020, Sowell wrote that if the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, it could signal a point of no return for the United States, a tipping point akin to the fall of the Roman Empire. In an interview in July 2020, he stated that \"the Roman Empire overcame many problems in its long history but eventually it reached a point where it could no longer continue, and much of that was from within, not just the barbarians attacking from outside.\" Sowell wrote that if Biden became president, the Democratic Party would have an enormous amount of control over the nation, and if this happened, they could twin with the \"radical left\" and ideas such as defunding the police could come to fruition.[65][83]\n\nEducation[edit]\nSowell has written about education throughout his career. He has argued for the need for reform of the school system in the United States. In his latest book, Charter Schools and Their Enemies (2020), Sowell compares the educational outcomes of school children educated at charter schools with those at conventional public schools. In his research, Sowell first explains the need and his methodology for choosing comparable students\u2014both ethnically and socioeconomically\u2014before listing his findings. He presents the case that charter schools on the whole do significantly better in terms of educational outcomes than conventional schools.[84][85][86]\nSowell argues that many U.S. schools are failing children; contends that \"indoctrination\" has taken the place of proper education; and argues that teachers' unions have promoted harmful education policies.  Sowell contends that many schools have become monopolies for educational bureaucracies.[87]\nIn his book Education: Assumptions Versus History (1986), Sowell analyzes the state of education in U.S. schools and universities. In particular, he examines the experiences of blacks and other ethnic groups in the American education system and identifies the factors and patterns behind both success and failure.[88]\n\nReception[edit]\nClassical liberals, libertarians, and conservatives of different disciplines have received Sowell's work positively.[89][90][91][92] Among these, he has been noted for originality, depth and breadth,[93][94] clarity of expression, and thoroughness of research.[95][94][96] Sowell's publications have been received positively by economists Steven Plaut,[96] Steve H. Hanke[97] James M. Buchanan;[78] and John B. Taylor;[98] philosophers Carl Cohen[99] and Tibor Machan;[100] science historian Michael Shermer;[101] essayist Gerald Early;[4] political scientists Abigail Thernstrom[102] and Charles Murray;[93] psychologists Steven Pinker[103][104] and Jonathan Haidt;[105][106] and Josef Joffe, publisher and editor of Die Zeit.[94] Steve Forbes, in a 2015 column, stated that \"it's a scandal that economist Thomas Sowell has not been awarded the Nobel Prize. No one alive has turned out so many insightful, richly researched books.\"[107] Nathan J. Robinson stated that Sowell \"is not given much attention by mainstream scholars in the academy, and few of his books are reviewed by major liberal-leaning publications.\"[108]\nEconomist James B. Stewart wrote a critical review of Black Rednecks and White Liberals, calling it \"the latest salvo in Thomas Sowell's continuing crusade to represent allegedly dysfunctional value orientations and behavioral characteristics of African Americans as the principal reasons for persistent economic and social disparities.\" He also criticized it for downplaying the impact of slavery.[109] Particularly in black communities in the 1980s Sowell became, in historian Michael Ondaatje's words, \"persona non grata, someone known to talk about, rather than with, African Americans\".[110] Economist Bernadette Chachere,[111] law professor Richard Thompson Ford,[112] and sociologists William Julius Wilson[113] and Richard Coughlin[114] have criticized some of his work. Criticisms include neglecting discrimination against women in the workforce in Rhetoric or Reality?,[113] the methodology of Race and Culture: A World View,[114] and portrayal of opposing theories in Intellectuals and Race.[112] Economist Jennifer Doleac criticized Discrimination and Disparities, arguing that statistical discrimination is real and pervasive (Sowell argues that existing racial disparities are mostly due to accurate sorting based on underlying characteristics, such as education) and that government intervention can achieve societal goals and make markets work more efficiently.[115] Columnist Steven Pearlstein criticized Wealth, Poverty and Politics.[18]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nSowell was married to Alma Jean Parr from 1964 to 1975, and married Mary Ash in 1981.[116] He has two children.[11][117][118]\n\nLegacy and honors[edit]\nClarence Thomas (last on right) accepting the 2002 National Humanities Medal on Sowell's behalf\n1982: the Mencken Award for Best Book, from the Free Press Association, for his Ethnic America: A History.\n1990: the Francis Boyer Award, presented by the American Enterprise Institute.\n1998: the Sydney Hook Award, from the National Association of Scholars.[119]\n1998: elected membership to the American Philosophical Society.[120]\n2002: the National Humanities Medal, presented by President George W.

He is Professor of Economics at George Mason University, where he holds the Adam Smith Chair at the Mercatus Center.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nTimothy Groseclose was born on September 22, 1964, in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[1]\nHe was graduated from Lakeside High School in Hot Springs, Arkansas in 1983.[1] He graduated from Stanford University, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematical and computational sciences in 1987.[2] He received a PhD in Political Economics from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1992.[2]\n\nAcademic career[edit]\nGroseclose started his academic career as assistant professor of political science and political economy at Carnegie Mellon University from 1992 to 1995.[1] He served as assistant professor of political science at Ohio State University from 1996 to 1998.[1]\nGroseclose became a tenured associate professor of political economy at his alma mater, the Stanford Graduate School of Business, in 1998, where he taught until 2003.[1] He was then associate professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from 2003 to 2005, and became full professor in 2005.[1] In 2006, he also became professor of economics at UCLA.[1] He later served as the Marvin Hoffenberg Professor of American Politics at UCLA.[3] However, he felt ostracized as a conservative faculty member, and decided to resign.[3]\nGroseclose is professor at George Mason University, where he holds the Adam Smith Chair at the Mercatus Center.[3]\n\nResearch on American media liberal bias[edit]\nTim Groseclose speaking at the Miller Center\nIn 2005, Groseclose co-authored an article with Jeffrey Milyo, a professor of economics at the University of Missouri, in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, entitled \"A Measure of Media Bias\".[4] The article suggested the American media had a liberal bias.[5] Drawing upon this article, Groseclose published \"Left Turn: How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind\" in 2012.[5]  The book suggests that all media outlets in the United States are left-leaning.[6] He adds that conservative media outlets like Fox News and the Drudge Report are only moderately conservative.[6] Furthermore, he goes on to argue that the left-wing media bias influences American voters to lean left.[6] If it were not for media bias, he claims that the US would think and vote like a solid red state, such as Texas or Kentucky. He also suggests that Republican candidate John McCain would have won the 2008 United States presidential election.[6]\nIn a review for The Washington Times, L. Brent Bozell III, the president of the Media Research Center, praised Groseclose's \"fierce intellectual honesty,\" explaining, \"He makes no bones about his own political biases.\"[7] Brozell also praised Groseclose's willingness to accept peer review, even from liberal critics.[7] However, he was critical of the preponderance of \"quantitative mathematical formulations\" at the expense of \"qualitative analysis.\"[7] Similarly, he dismissed Groseclose's use of \"statistical jargon\" as \"pure mumbo-jumbo that the layman just must accept.\"[7] Meanwhile, in the Huffington Post, Terry Krepel suggested Groseclose was \"more interested in trying to forward a conservative agenda than objective research.\"[5] He also criticized the \"lack of attention to detail in Groseclose's book that raises questions about his larger conclusions.\"[5] In addition, GMU Economics professor and co-author of the Marginal Revolution blog, Tyler Cowen, stated, \u201cThis book serves up the most convincing evidence for media bias I have seen, ever. Tim Groseclose is the leading academic scholar in the area, but this is a smartly-written book which every person can read for enlightenment and also for pleasure.\u201d[8] Furthermore, Steven Levitt, professor of economics at the University of Chicago and co-author of Freakoconomics took the position that, \u201cI'm no conservative, but I loved Left Turn. Tim Groseclose has written the best kind of book: one that is firmly anchored in rigorous academic research, but is still so much fun to read that it is hard to put down. Liberals will not like the conclusions of this book, which in my opinion, is all the more reason why they should want to read it.\u201d[8]\nOthers have not been as favorably inclined towards the methodology of the measure. Brendan Nyhan, an assistant professor in the Department of Government at Dartmouth College argues that left and center-left think-tanks have more credentialed experts with peer-reviewed publications than conservatives, which may result in a greater number of citations by the press, which seeks out expert perspectives on the news, but not more citations by members of Congress, who generally seek out views that reinforce their own.[9]\nGasper (2011) shows that the estimates are sensitive to the time period under examination and that removing a single think tank shifts estimates dramatically.[10] Additionally, the estimates of media bias do not comport with more direct measures of media bias derived from computational text analysis[11] or sometimes face validity.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nGroseclose is married to Victoria Groseclose (n\u00e9e DeGuzman).[1] They have two children.[1]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nLeft Turn: How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind (New York City: St. Martin's Press, 2012).\nCheating: An Insider's Report on the Use of Race in Admissions at UCLA (Dog Ear Publishing, 2014).\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i \"Curriculum Vita\".

He first became known for live streaming the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests.[5][6] He joined Vice Media and Fusion TV in 2014, later working alone on YouTube and other platforms, where he is known for promoting right-wing views.[7][8]\n\n\nEarly life\nPool was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in a middle-class family. His father was a firefighter and his mother sold cars.[9] Pool attended a Catholic school until completing the fifth grade[10] and left school at the age of 14.[9][11]\n\nCareer\nOccupy Wall Street\nAfter watching a viral video from Occupy Wall Street, Pool purchased a one-way bus ticket to New York.[12] Pool joined the Occupy Wall Street protestors on September 20, 2011, and met Henry Ferry, a former realtor and sales manager, shortly afterwards, and they formed a media company called The Other 99.[13] Pool also began livestreaming the protests with his cell phone and quickly assumed an on-camera role.[12] Pool used a live-chat stream to respond to questions from viewers while reporting on Occupy Wall Street.[14] Pool also let his viewers direct him on where to shoot footage.[15] He modified a toy remote-controlled Parrot AR.Drone for aerial surveillance and modified software for live streaming into a system called DroneStream.[16][17] In mid-November 2011, Pool provided non-stop 21 hour coverage of Occupy Wall Street's eviction from Zuccotti Park.[18] Pool's use of live streaming video and aerial drones during Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011 led to an article in The Guardian querying whether such activities could take the form of counterproductive surveillance.[17]\nIn January 2012, he was physically accosted by a masked assailant.[18][19] Also in January 2012, The Other 99 was disbanded following a feud between Pool and Ferry.[20][21] Pool had also planned on livestreaming occupy protests across the United States for a documentary called Occumentary, but it was never filmed.[12]\nPool's video taken during the protests was instrumental evidence in the acquittal of photographer Alexander Arbuckle, who had been arrested by the NYPD. The video showed that the arresting officer lied under oath, though no charges were filed.[22] While covering the NoNATO protests at the 2012 Chicago summit, Pool and four others were pulled over by a dozen Chicago police officers in unmarked vehicles. The group was removed from the vehicle at gunpoint, questioned, and detained for ten minutes. The reason given by police was that the team's vehicle matched a description.[23]\nIn the context of the Occupy movement, Pool's footage was aired on NBC and other mainstream networks.[13][16][24][25] According to The Washington Post, Pool \"helped demonstrate to activists that livestreaming had potential as an alternative to depending on cable news coverage\".[26] He was nominated as a Time 100 personality in March 2012 for his importance to the Occupy movement, alongside David Graeber,[27] as Time dubbed Pool \"the eyes of the movement\".[28]\nIn November 2011, Pool told On the Media, \"I don't consider myself a journalist.\" \"I consider myself an activist 100%\" there \"to support the movement.\"[29] In October 2012, he told El Pa\u00eds that \"I'm not an activist\" and described himself as a journalist.[30] In 2018, Pool said that \"I don't align with Occupy Wall Street and never did\".[31] In 2021, he denounced the Occupy movement as \"crooked\".[32]\n\nVice and Fusion\nPool in 2015\nAfter joining Vice Media, Pool began producing and hosting content and developed new methods of reporting.[33] In 2013, he reported on the Gezi Park protests in Istanbul with Google Glass.[34][33] In April 2013, Pool received a Shorty Award in the \"Best Journalist in Social Media\" category.[35] From 2013 to 2014, while working for Vice, Pool covered and live streamed the mass protests in Ukraine that led to the collapse of the Yanukovych government.[36] He also covered the Ferguson unrest and covered protests in Thailand, Turkey, and Egypt.[12]\nIn 2014, he joined Fusion TV as Director of Media innovation and Senior Correspondent.[37][38][39]\n\nIndependent work\nAs of 2021, Pool operates six YouTube channels, two of which, Timcast and Tim Pool, feature daily political commentary,[needs update] while a third serves as a clip channel for Pool's podcast, Timcast IRL.[40][41]\nIn May 2022, it was estimated that Timcast IRL generated $65,824.86 in non-advertising revenue for YouTube across 100 videos on the Timcast IRL channel from October 2020 to November 2021.[42]\n\nJournalism and commentary\nPool covered the 2016 Milwaukee riots. Pool said he would leave the area and stop reporting on these events, saying he thought it was dangerous due to perceived escalating \"racial tensions\".[43][44]\nIn February 2017, Pool traveled to Sweden to investigate claims of \"no-go zones\" and problems with refugees in the country. He launched a crowdfunding effort to do so after U.S. president Donald Trump alluded to crimes related to immigration in Sweden. InfoWars writer Paul Joseph Watson offered to pay for travel costs and accommodation for any reporter \"to stay in crime-ridden migrant suburbs of Malm\u00f6.\"[45][46] Watson donated $2,000 to Pool's crowdfund to travel to Sweden.[12] While in Sweden, Pool largely disputed that migrant suburbs of Malm\u00f6 and Stockholm were crime ridden, saying that Chicago is vastly more violent.[47][45][46] While filming in Rinkeby, a Stockholm suburb, Pool alleged that he had to be escorted by police, due to purported threats to his safety. Swedish police have disputed Pool's claims, stating, \"Our understanding is that he didn't receive an escort. However, he followed the police who left the place.\"[48] The police stated that, \"When Tim Pool took out a camera and started filming, a group of young people pulled their hoods up and covered their faces and shouted at him to stop filming. The officers then told Tim Pool that it was not wise to stay there in the middle of the square and keep filming.\"[48]\nIn November 2017, Pool created his second YouTube channel, Timcast News.[49]\nIn 2019, podcaster Joe Rogan invited Pool onto his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, following an interview with Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. The two criticized the banning of Milo Yiannopoulos from Twitter, arguing that the provocateur had not truly encouraged his fans to harass Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones.[50] The Atlantic contributor Devin Gordon criticized Rogan and Pool, stating that both men demonstrated a limited understanding of Twitter, censorship, and abuse during the discussion.[51] Rogan invited Pool and Dorsey, as well as Twitter chief legal officer Vijaya Gadde, back on his podcast. Pool described cases where he asserted conservatives were unfairly suspended on Twitter. In particular, Pool brought up the banning of Alex Jones and argued that Twitter rules against misgendering transgender users is ideological. Gadde said that Twitter is a free speech platform on which punishments are based on evaluation of consistently-applied harassment guidelines.[52][53]\nIn July 2019, Pool participated in a White House event hosting right-wing internet personalities who President Trump characterized as unfairly targeted for their views.[7]\nIn August 2020, Trump liked a tweet published by Pool expressing sympathy and support for Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old boy from Antioch, Illinois then facing trial on charges of killing two people during the riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin for which he was ultimately acquitted.[54] Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., retweeted a statement by Pool describing how the case of Rittenhouse had convinced Pool to vote for Trump.[55][56][57][58][excessive citations]\nA report from the Election Integrity Partnership (EIP) said that Pool was a \"superspreader\" of fake news surrounding voter fraud before and after the 2020 United States presidential election.[59]\nIn June 2021, Pool invited North Korean defector Yeonmi Park onto his podcast. Park claimed that North Koreans \u201cdon\u2019t know the concept of love\u201d aside from political admiration of Kim Jong-Un. Pool replied by telling her that this was \"The most villainous thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d however an investigation by experts and journalist into Park's claims about North Korea found that she had fabricated many of her stories, including the ones she told Pool.[60]\nIn August 2021, Pool criticized New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's COVID-19 vaccine passport mandate, as it did not have any exemptions for immunocompromised people or people with other disabilities.[61]\nIn April 2022, Pool and The Daily Wire CEO Jeremy Boreing purchased a billboard in Times Square to accuse Taylor Lorenz of doxxing the Twitter account Libs of TikTok. In response, Lorenz called the billboard \"so idiotic it's hilarious\".[62]\nIn July 2022, Pool had an op-ed published in Newsweek magazine in response to video footage of him being included in the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack public hearings.[63] Pool claimed the committee misrepresented him with an out of context clip of him reading a Fox News news article alongside people calling for a \"red wedding\".[63]\nIn November 2022, Pool interviewed rapper and presidential candidate Kanye West on his podcast, Timcast IRL. West's political advisors, alt-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos and white supremacist Nick Fuentes also participated in the interview. The interview came days after West and Fuentes met with former President Trump. During the interview, West made a series of antisemitic statements, including claims about a Jewish conspiracy controlling the American government and media. Pool criticized West's comments on Jews, saying \"I'm gonna disagree with you.\" After Pool refused to criticize Jews, West and his advisors walked out of the interview.[64][65][66]\nAccording to The Independent, BuzzFeed News, and The Daily Dot, Pool has a \"primarily right-wing audience\".[57][67][68]\n\nOther activities\nIn 2014, Pool helped launch Tagg.ly, a mobile app that watermarks photos. Pool said he was interested in this kind of application due to experiences where others used his photographs without attribution.[69][70]\nIn 2019, he co-founded the news company Subverse, which raised $1 million in 22 hours via regulation crowdfunding in 2019, surpassing the previous record on Wefunder.[71] The service was later renamed SCNR. Pool partnered with Emily Molli and former Vice editor-in-chief Rocco Castoro, although Pool later fired both of them in January 2021.[72][73]\nIn 2022, he collaborated with drummer Pete Parada to release two singles \"Genocide\" and \"Only Ever Wanted\". \"Only Ever Wanted\" reached the No. 2 spot on the global iTunes chart.[74] The single was most downloaded on the Billboard charts in September 2022 in Alternative Digital Song Sales.[75] Both singles reached the No. 1 spot on iTunes.\n\nSingles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeak Chart Positions\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nUS Digital Sales\n[76]\n\n\nUS Rock\n[77]\n\n\nUS Rock and Alternative\n[78]\n\n\nUS Alternative\n[79]\n\n\nUS Alternative Digital\n[80]\n\n\nUK SIngles\n[81]\n\n\nUK Singles Downloads\n[82]\n\n\nlabel\n\n\n2020\n\n\"Will of The People\"[83]\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n17\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nTimcast Records\n\n\n2022\n\n\"Genocide\n(Losing My Mind)\" ft.

A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a Charleston city councilor, a state representative, and a U.S. Representative. He also worked in financial services before entering politics. \nScott served on the Charleston County Council from 1995 to 2009. He then served in the South Carolina General Assembly from 2009 to 2011, and represented South Carolina's 1st congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013.\nNikki Haley, who was then governor of South Carolina, appointed Scott to the U.S. Senate in 2013 to fill a vacancy. He retained his Senate seat after winning a special election in 2014, and was elected to a full term in 2016 and reelected in 2022. He became the first African-American senator to be elected from the Southern United States since the Reconstruction era.[1][2]\nScott was a a candidate in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries, forming an exploratory committee on April 13, 2023.[3] He filed Federal Election Commission paperwork to run for president on May 19, and formally declared his candidacy three days later.[4] Scott suspended his campaign on November 12 of that year due to low poll numbers.[5]\n\n\nEarly life and education\nTim Scott was born on September 19, 1965, in North Charleston, South Carolina, to Frances, a nursing assistant, and Ben Scott Sr. When Scott was seven years old, his parents divorced, leaving him and his older brother, who later became a sergeant major in the U.S. Army, to grow up in working-class poverty with their mother. Frances often worked double shifts to support her family.[6][7]\nAfter his parents' divorce, Scott, along with his mother and older brother, moved into his maternal grandparents' house. There, he formed a close bond with his grandfather.[6]\nAs a freshman at North Charleston's R.B. Stall High School, he failed several subjects, prompting his mother to send him to summer school, which he had to finance by working at a local movie theater.[6] During this time, he met John Moniz, the owner of a nearby Chick-fil-A. Their initial interaction over a sandwich at Scott's workplace evolved into a substantial mentorship. Moniz educated Scott on individual responsibility, conservative business principles, philanthropy, and finance.[6]\nFrom an early age, Scott enjoyed sports, and excelled at football. He overcame racial prejudice in high school, securing election as student body vice president in his junior year and student body president as a senior.[6]\nA month before his senior year, he fell asleep while driving, resulting in a car accident that dimmed his prospects as a football recruit. Nevertheless, he attended Presbyterian College from 1983 to 1984 on a partial football scholarship. There he was introduced to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, an encounter that led him to his Christian faith, which became a central part of his life.[6] Scott later transferred to Charleston Southern University, where he graduated in 1988 with a Bachelor of Science degree in political science.[8]\nUpon graduating from college, Scott worked as an insurance agent and financial adviser, a stepping stone toward starting his insurance agency, Tim Scott Allstate. His professional accomplishments enabled him to purchase a home for his mother.[6]\n\nEarly political career\nCharleston County Council (1995\u20132009)\nElections\nScott ran in a February 1995 special election for the Charleston County Council at-large seat vacated by Keith Summey, who had resigned upon being elected mayor of North Charleston.[9][10] Scott won the seat as a Republican, receiving nearly 80% of the vote in the white-majority district.[11] He became the first black Republican elected to any office in South Carolina since the late 19th century.[12]\nIn 1996, Scott challenged Democratic State Senator Robert Ford in South Carolina's 42nd Senate district but lost 65\u201335%.[13][14]\nScott was reelected to the Charleston County Council in 2000.[15] In 2004, he was reelected again with 61% of the vote, defeating Democrat Elliot Summey (son of Mayor Keith Summey).[16][17][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n\nTenure on County Council\nScott served on the Charleston County Council from 1995 until 2009, becoming chairman in 2007.[18] In 1997, he supported posting the Ten Commandments outside the council chambers, saying it would remind members of the absolute rules they should follow. The county council unanimously approved the display, and Scott nailed a King James version of the Commandments to the wall. Shortly thereafter, the ACLU and Americans United for Separation of Church and State challenged this in a federal suit. After an initial court ruling that the display was unconstitutional, the council settled out of court to avoid incurring more legal fees. Of the costs of the suit, Scott said, \"Whatever it costs in the pursuit of this goal is worth it.\"[19]\nIn January 2001, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Charleston County, South Carolina for racial discrimination under the Voting Rights Act, because its council seats were based on at-large elections, meaning that the whole county voted to fill each seat. DOJ had attempted to negotiate with county officials on this issue in November 2000. Justice officials noted that at-large seats dilute the voting strength of the significant African American minority in the county, who in 2000 made up 34.5% of the population. They had been unable to elect any \"candidates of their choice\" for years. Whites or European Americans made up 61.9% of the county population.[20] County officials noted that the majority of voters in 1989 had approved electing members by at-large seats in a popular referendum.[21]\nScott, the only African American member of the county council, said of this case and the alternative of electing council members from single-member districts:\n\nI don't like the idea of segregating everyone into smaller districts. Besides, the Justice Department assumes that the only way for African-Americans to have representation is to elect an African-American, and the same for whites. Obviously, my constituents don't think that's true.[21]\nThe Department of Justice alleged that the issue was not a question of ethnicity, stating that voters in black precincts in the county had rejected Scott as a candidate for the council. The lawsuit noted that because of the white majority, \"white bloc voting usually results in the defeat of candidates who are preferred by black voters.\"[21] The Department added that blacks live in compact areas of the county and could be a majority in three districts if the county seats were apportioned as nine single-member districts.[21]\nThe Department of Justice won the case. A new districting plan replaced the at-large method of electing the Charleston City Council. The federal court found that the former method violated the Voting Rights Act, following a lawsuit brought by the Justice Department.[22] Scott was then elected to the Charleston County Council by District 3, rather than by the whole county.[16]\n\nCommittee assignments\nEconomic Development Committee (Chair)[23]\nSouth Carolina House of Representatives (2009\u20132011)\nElections\nIn 2008, incumbent Republican State Representative Tom Dantzler decided to retire. With support from advisors such as Nicolas Muzin,[24] Scott ran for his seat in District 117 of the South Carolina House of Representatives and won the Republican primary with 53% of the vote, defeating Bill Crosby and Wheeler Tillman.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] He won the general election unopposed,[26][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] becoming the first Republican African-American State Representative in South Carolina in more than 100 years.[27][28][failed verification]\n\nTenure in state legislature\nScott supported South Carolina's right-to-work laws and argued that Boeing chose South Carolina as a site for manufacturing for that reason.[29]\nIn South Carolina Club for Growth's 2009\u20132010 scorecard, Scott earned a B and a score of 80 out of 100.[30] The South Carolina Association of Taxpayers praised his \"diligent, principled and courageous stands against higher taxes.\"[31]\n\nCommittee assignments\nJudiciary\nLabor, Commerce and Industry\nWays and Means[32]\nU.S. House of Representatives (2011\u20132013)\nElections\n2010\nSee also: 2010 United States House of Representatives elections \u00a7\u00a0South Carolina\nScott entered the election for lieutenant governor but switched to run for South Carolina's 1st congressional district after Republican incumbent Henry Brown announced his retirement. The 1st district is based in Charleston and includes approximately the northern 3/4 of the state's coastline (except for Beaufort and Hilton Head Island, which were included in the 2nd District after redistricting).[33]\nScott finished first in the nine-candidate June 8 Republican primary, receiving a plurality of 32% of the vote.[34] Fellow Charleston County Councilman Paul Thurmond was second with 16%. Carroll A. Campbell III, the son of former Governor Carroll A. Campbell Jr., was third with 14%.[35][36] Charleston County School Board member Larry Kobrovsky ranked fourth with 11%. Five other candidates had single-digit percentages.[37]\nA runoff was held on June 22 between Scott and Thurmond. Scott was endorsed by the Club for Growth,[38] various Tea Party movement groups, former Alaska governor and vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin,[39][40] Republican House Whip Eric Cantor,[41] former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee,[42] and South Carolina Senator and Minuteman Project founder Jim DeMint.[13] He defeated Thurmond[43] 68\u201332% and won every county in the district.[44][45]\nAccording to the Associated Press, Scott \"swamped his opponents in fundraising, spending almost $725,000 during the election cycle to less than $20,000 for his November opponents\".[39] He won the general election against Democratic nominee Ben Frasier 65\u201329%.[46] With this election, Scott and Allen West of Florida became the first African-American Republicans in Congress since J. C. Watts retired in 2003.[47] Scott also became the first African-American Republican elected to Congress from South Carolina in 114 years.[48]\n\n2012\nSee also: 2012 United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina\nScott was unopposed in the primary and won the general election against Democratic nominee Bobbie Rose, 62\u201336%.[49][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed][50]\n\nTenure as congressman\nScott's official 112th Congress portrait\nScott declined to join the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). He recognized the efforts of the CBC but said \"My campaign was never about race.\"[51]\nIn March 2011, Scott co-sponsored a welfare reform bill that the liberal blog ThinkProgress said would terminate food stamps to families when a family member participates in a labor strike; the Republican Study Committee denied that charge.[52][53] He introduced legislation in July 2011 so that the National Labor Relations Board could not order \"any employer to relocate, shut down, or transfer employment under any circumstance\".[54] The NLRB had recently opposed the relocation of a Boeing production facility from Washington state to South Carolina.[54]\nScott successfully advocated for federal funds for a Charleston harbor dredging project estimated at $300 million, saying the project was neither an earmark nor an example of wasteful government spending. He said the project was merit-based and in the national interest because larger cargo ships could use the port and jobs would be created.[55] During the summer 2011 debate over raising the U.S. debt ceiling, Scott supported the inclusion of a balanced budget amendment in the debt ceiling bill, but after a day full of meetings and prayer he went from leaning No on the bill to voting No.[56][57]\n\nScott speaking at a Veterans Day event in 2011\nCommittee assignments\nThe House Republican Steering Committee appointed Scott to the Committee on Transportation and the Committee on Small Business.[58] He was later appointed to the Committee on Rules and relinquished his other two assignments.[59]\n\nCommittee on Rules\nSubcommittee on Rules and the Organization of the House\nU.S. Senate (2013\u2013present)\n2012 appointment\nOn December 17, 2012, South Carolina governor Nikki Haley announced she would appoint Scott to replace retiring Senator Jim DeMint, who had previously announced that he would retire from the Senate to become the President of The Heritage Foundation.[60] Scott is the first African American U.S. senator from South Carolina. He was one of three black U.S. Senators in the 113th Congress, alongside Mo Cowan and later Cory Booker (and the first since Roland Burris retired in 2010 after succeeding Barack Obama). He is the first African American to be a U.S. senator from the Southern United States since Reconstruction.[61]\nDuring two periods, first from January 2, 2013, until February 1, 2013, and again from July 16, 2013, until October 31, 2013, Scott was the only African American senator. He and Cowan were the first black senators to serve alongside each other.\nNews media reported that Scott, Representative Trey Gowdy, former South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster, former First Lady of South Carolina Jenny Sanford, and South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control Director Catherine Templeton were on Haley's short list to replace DeMint.[62] Of choosing Scott, Haley said, \"It is important to me, as a minority female, that Congressman Scott earned this seat, he earned this seat for the person that he is. He earned this seat with the results he has shown.\"[63]\n\nElections\n2014\nMain article: 2014 United States Senate special election in South CarolinaScott ran to serve the final two years of DeMint's term and won.[64] In January 2014, he signed an amicus brief in support of Senator Ron Johnson's legal challenge to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's Affordable Care Act ruling.[65][66][67]\n2016\nMain article: 2016 United States Senate election in South Carolina\nScott was reelected to a full term in office.[68] He was endorsed by the Club for Growth.[69]\nIn July 2018, Scott and Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris introduced a bipartisan bill to make lynching a federal hate crime.[70]\nIn February 2019, Scott was one of 16 senators to vote against legislation preventing a partial government shutdown and containing $1.375 billion for barriers along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border that included 55 miles of fencing.[71]\nIn April 2021, Scott delivered the Republican response to President Joe Biden's Joint Address to Congress.[72]\nOn May 28, 2021, Scott voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 U.S. Capitol attack.[73][74]\n\n2022\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in South Carolina\nIn August 2019, Scott said, \"I plan to run for reelection, but that will be my last one, if I run.\" He was reelected in 2022, defeating Democratic nominee Krystle Matthews.[75][76]\n\nTenure in U.S. Senate\nScott with President Donald Trump in 2017\nJustice Act\nScott led the drafting of a bill on race and police reform.[77] Amid skeptical reactions from others in the black community, he tweeted, \"Not surprising the last 24 hours have seen a lot of 'token' 'boy' or 'you're being used' in my mentions\" and \"Let me get this straight ... you DON'T want the person who has faced racial profiling by police, been pulled over dozens of times, or been speaking out for YEARS drafting this?\".[77]\nScott's 106-page Justice Act[78] included:\n\nIncreased federal reporting requirements for use of force, no-knock warrants.\nIncreased penalties for false police reports.[79]\nWithheld funding for police departments that allow chokeholds when deadly force is not authorized.[79]\nGrants for expanding police body cameras with penalties for failing to use them.[79]\nCreated a database of police disciplinary records for use in hiring.[79]\nCreated a federal crime for lynching.[79]\nDirected the Justice Department to provide training on deescalation tactics and implement duty-to-intervene policies.[79]\nThe bill lacked provisions demanded by Democrats, including restrictions on qualified immunity. Nancy Pelosi called Scott's bill \"inadequate\",[80] and said Republicans \"understand that there's a need to get something done. ... They admit that and have some suggestions that are worthy of consideration\u2014but so far, they were trying to get away with murder, actually\u2014the murder of George Floyd.\"[81] Senate Minority Whip Democrat Dick Durbin called the bill \"token\" legislation, although he later apologized to Scott.[82] Two Democrats and one Independent senator who caucuses with Democrats broke with the party to support Scott's bill, but, ultimately, Democrats used the filibuster to block it; it received 55 of the required 60 votes.[83]Scott speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland\nCommittee assignments\nCurrent\nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\nSubcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection\nSubcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development (Chairman)\nSubcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment\nCommittee on Finance\nSubcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure\nSubcommittee on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth (Chairman)\nSubcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight\nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\nSubcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety (Chairman)\nSubcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security\nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\nSpecial Committee on Aging\nPrevious\nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (2013\u20132015)\nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources (2013\u20132015)\nCommittee on Armed Services (2018\u20132019)\n2024 presidential campaign\nMain article: Tim Scott 2024 presidential campaign\nIn February 2023, it was reported that Scott was preparing for a presidential run.[84] He announced a \"listening tour\" that would include a Black History Month event in Charleston, South Carolina, as the tour's first stop and then hosted events and speeches throughout Iowa, the first state to vote in the 2024 Republican presidential primaries.[85] Other announced and suspected Republican candidates also hosted events in Iowa at the same time as Scott.[86]\nOn April 12, 2023, Scott formed an exploratory committee to potentially run for president.[3] On May 19, he filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for president.[87][88] He formally announced his candidacy on May 22, in North Charleston, South Carolina.[89]\nScott announced the suspension of his campaign on Fox News's Sunday Night in America with Trey Gowdy on November 12, 2023.[5]\n\nPolitical positions\nTaxes and spending\nScott believes that federal spending and taxes should be reduced,[13] with a Balanced Budget Amendment and the FairTax respectively implemented for spending and taxes.[citation needed]\n\nHealth care\nScott believes the Affordable Care Act should be repealed.[13][90][91] He has said that U.S. health care is among the greatest in the world,[91] that people all over the world come to study in American medical schools, waiting lists are rare, and that Americans are able to choose their insurance, providers, and course of treatment.[91] Scott supports an alternative to the ACA that he says keeps its benefits while controlling costs by reforming the medical tort system by limiting non-economic damages[91] and by reforming Medicare.[91]\nIn January 2019, Scott was one of six senators to cosponsor the Health Insurance Tax Relief Act, delaying the Health Insurance Tax for two years.[92]\n\nEconomic development\nScott supports infrastructure development and public works for his district.[13] He opposes restrictions on deepwater oil drilling.[13] He proposed the opportunity zone designation in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.[citation needed]\nScott was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[93]\n\nSocial issues\nScott describes himself as pro-life and has been a vocal opponent of abortion. He supports adult and cord blood stem cell research,[94] but opposes taxpayer-funded embryonic stem cell research[95] and the creation of human embryos for experimentation.[96] In a 2023 interview, he said he would sign a 20-week federal abortion ban into law if elected president.[97] He also opposes assisted suicide.[94] While campaigning for president, he has dodged questions about whether he supports a six-week abortion ban.[98]\nScott opposes same-sex marriage,[99] and voted against the Respect for Marriage Act of 2022, which provided federal statutory recognition of same-sex marriage.[100]\nIn 2022 and 2023, he and Senator Rick Scott (no relation) co-sponsored the PROTECT Kids Act, a bill that would cut federal funding to schools unless they informed parents of changes in children's \"pronouns, gender markers, or sex-based accommodations (including locker rooms and bathrooms).\"[101] On August 23, 2023, in a debate between Republican presidential candidates, he said: \"If God made you a man, you play sports\u2014against men.\"[102]\n\nImmigration\nScott supports federal legislation similar to Arizona SB 1070.[103] He supports strengthening penalties for employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.[103] He also promotes cultural assimilation by making English the official language in the government and requiring new immigrants to learn English.[103] He opposes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.[104]\n\nLabor\nScott introduced a bill that would deny food stamps to families whose incomes declined to the point of eligibility because a family member was participating in a labor strike.[105]\n\nForeign policy\nScott advocated continued military presence in Afghanistan and believed early withdrawal would benefit al-Qaeda. He views Iran as the world's most dangerous country and believes the U.S. should aid pro-democracy groups there.[106] Scott opposed the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[107]\nScott rejected calls for a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war, saying: \"You cannot negotiate with evil. You have to destroy it.\"[108] He opposed sending humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip.[109] In a November 2023 Republican presidential primary debate, Scott suggested there could be no U.S.-Iranian diplomatic settlement; when asked about attacks by Iranian proxy forces in Iraq and Syria, he responded, \"You actually have to cut off the head of the snake, and the head of the snake is Iran and not simply their proxies.\"[110]\n\nChina\nIn November 2017, in response to efforts by China to purchase US tech companies, Scott was one of nine cosponsors of a bill that would broaden the federal government's ability to prevent foreign purchases of U.S. firms by strengthening the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to allow it to review and possibly decline smaller investments and add national security factors, including whether information about Americans would be exposed as part of transactions or whether a deal would facilitate fraud.[111]\n\nTrade\nIn January 2018, Scott was one of 36 Republican senators to sign a letter asking Trump to preserve the North American Free Trade Agreement in modernized form.[112]\n\nPolice body cameras\nAfter the shooting of Walter Scott (no relation), Scott urged the Senate to hold hearings on police body cameras.[113][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n\nEnvironment\nIn 2017, Scott was one of 22 senators to sign a letter[114] to President Donald Trump urging him to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. In the 2012, 2014, and 2016 election cycles, Scott's campaigns received over $540,000 in political donations from oil, gas and coal interests.[115]\n\nJudicial nominations\nScott meets with Judge Brett Kavanaugh in July 2018\nScott did not support the nomination of Ryan Bounds to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, effectively killing the nomination. His decision was based on what he called Bounds's \"bigoted statements he made as a Stanford student in the 1990s.\" Marco Rubio joined him in opposing the nomination shortly thereafter, prompting Mitch McConnell to drop the nomination.[116]\n\nScott with Judge Amy Coney Barrett in September 2020\nIn November 2018, Scott bucked his party in opposing the nomination of Thomas A. Farr for a federal judgeship.[117] Farr had been accused of suppression of African-American voters.[117] Scott cited Farr's involvement in the 1984 and 1990 Senate campaigns of Jesse Helms, which sought to suppress black voters, and a 1991 memo from the Department of Justice under the George H. W. Bush administration that stated that \"Farr was the primary coordinator of the 1984 'ballot security' program conducted by the NCGOP and 1984 Helms for Senate Committee. He coordinated several 'ballot security' activities in 1984, including a postcard mailing to voters in predominantly black precincts that was designed to serve as a basis to challenge voters on election day.\"[117] Further explaining his vote, Scott said the Republican Party was \"not doing a very good job of avoiding the obvious potholes on race in America.\"[118] In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal criticized Scott, arguing that Democrats would see Farr's defeat as a \"vindication of their most underhanded and inflammatory racial tactics.\"[119] In a letter to the Wall Street Journal, Scott said the publication was trying to \"deflect concerns\" about Farr's nomination.[120][121]\n\nPresident Trump and racism\nIn 2017, Scott reacted to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville by acknowledging that \"Racism is real. It is alive.\"[122] Asked to comment on Trump's statement that there had been \"good people\" on both sides at the rally and that there was \"blame on both sides\" for the violence that ensued,[123] Scott said that while Trump had initially \"rejected hatred, bigotry, and racism\" in his \"strong\" comments on the ensuing Monday, his comments on Tuesday \"started erasing the comments that were strong. What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority. And that moral authority is compromised when Tuesday happens. There's no question about that [...] I'm not going to defend the indefensible.\"[122]\nAfter meeting with Trump, Scott said that Trump \"was very receptive to listening\" and had \"obviously reflected on what he's said, on his intentions and the perceptions of those comments\" which were \"not exactly what he intended\".[124]\nScott called upon Trump to delete his tweets that attacked demonstrators against the murder of George Floyd. Scott said, \"Those are not constructive tweets, without any question. I'm thankful that we can have the conversation. ... We talked about the fact that there is a constructive way to have a dialogue with a nation in this similar fashion that we had a conversation after Charlottesville, the President will listen, if you engage him with the facts of the issue\".[125] Scott also advocated that Trump delete his retweet of supporters chanting \"white power\", which he soon did.[126][127]\n\nElectoral history\nPercentages may not total 100 because of rounding.\n\nRepublican Primary \u2013 2008 South Carolina General Assembly 117th District[128]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nTim Scott \n\n1,333 \n\n53.3 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nWilliam Bill Crosby\n\n647\n\n25.9\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nWheeler Tillman\n\n521\n\n20.8\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n2,501 \n\n100 \n\n\n\nGeneral election 2008\u00a0\u2013 South Carolina General Assembly 117th District[129]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nTim Scott \n\n9,080 \n\n99.3 \n\n\n\n\nWrite-in\n\n67\n\n0.7\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n9,147 \n\n100 \n\n\nTurnout\n\n\n\n76.0\n\n\n\nRepublican Primary\u00a0\u2013 2010 1st Congressional District of South Carolina[130]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nTim Scott \n\n25,457 \n\n31.5 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nPaul Thurmond\n\n13,149\n\n16.3\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nCarroll Campbell III\n\n11,665\n\n14.4\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nLarry Kobrovsky\n\n8,521\n\n10.5\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nStovall Witte\n\n7,192\n\n8.9\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nClark B Parker\n\n6,769\n\n8.4\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nKatherine Jenerette\n\n3,849\n\n4.8\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nMark Lutz\n\n3,237\n\n4.0\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nKen Glasson\n\n1,006\n\n1.2\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n80,845 \n\n100 \n\n\nTurnout\n\n\n\n24.1\n\n\n\nRepublican Primary Runoff\u00a0\u2013 2010 1st Congressional District of South Carolina[131]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nTim Scott \n\n46,885 \n\n68.4 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nPaul Thurmond\n\n21,706\n\n31.7\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n68,591 \n\n100 \n\n\n\n2010 1st Congressional District of South Carolina Elections[46]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nTim Scott \n\n152,755 \n\n65.4 \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nBen Frasier\n\n67,008\n\n28.7\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n219,763 \n\n100 \n\n\nTurnout\n\n\n\n51.9\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina's 1st congressional district, 2012[132][133][134]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nTim Scott (incumbent) \n\n179,908 \n\n62.0 \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nBobbie G.
