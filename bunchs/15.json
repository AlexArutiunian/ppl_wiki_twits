She served as a member of the United States House of Representatives representing Arizona's 8th congressional district from January 2007 until January 2012, when she resigned because of a severe brain injury suffered during an assassination attempt. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the third woman in Arizona's history to be elected to the U.S. Congress. \nBorn and raised in Tucson, Arizona, Giffords graduated from Scripps College and Cornell University. After initially moving to New York City, where she worked in regional economic development for Price Waterhouse, she returned to Arizona to work as the CEO of El Campo Tire Warehouses, a family business started by her grandfather. She served in the Arizona House of Representatives from 2001 until 2003 and the Arizona Senate from 2003 until 2005 when she was elected to the U.S. House.\nShe had just begun her third term in January 2011 when she was shot in the head in an assassination attempt and mass shooting just outside of Tucson during an event with constituents. Giffords has since recovered much of her ability to walk, speak, read, and write. She was greeted by a standing ovation upon her return to the House floor in August 2011. She attended President Obama's State of the Union address on January 24, 2012, and appeared on the floor of the House the following day, at which time she formally submitted her resignation, receiving a standing ovation and accolades from her colleagues and the leadership of the House.\nThough a moderate on the issue during her time in Congress, Giffords has since become an ardent advocate for gun control. In January 2013, she and her husband launched Americans for Responsible Solutions, a non-profit organization and Super-PAC which later joined with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence to become Giffords. She is married to former Space Shuttle Commander Mark Kelly, a United States senator from Arizona.\n\n\nEarly life\nGabrielle Dee Giffords was born in and grew up in Tucson, Arizona; her parents were Gloria Kay (n\u00e9e Fraser) and Spencer J. Giffords. She was raised in a mixed religious environment, as her mother was a Christian Scientist and her father was Jewish. Her paternal grandfather, Akiba Hornstein, was a Jewish emigrant from Lithuania who changed his name to Giffords to avoid anti-Semitism in the United States.[3] Through her father, Giffords is a second cousin of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and director Jake Paltrow.[2]\nGiffords graduated from Tucson's University High School. She is a former Girl Scout. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology and Latin American History from Scripps College in California in 1993;[4] and spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar in Chihuahua, Mexico.[5] She returned to graduate school, earning a Master's degree in Regional Planning from Cornell University in 1996. She focused her studies on Mexican-American relations.[4]\nGiffords worked as an associate for regional economic development at Price Waterhouse in New York City. In 1996, she became president and CEO of El Campo Tire Warehouses, a local chain of auto service centers founded by her grandfather. The business was sold to Goodyear Tire in 2000. At the time of the sale, she commented on the difficulties local businesses face when competing against large national firms.[6]\nSince 2001, she has practiced Judaism exclusively and belongs to Congregation Chaverim, a Reform synagogue, in Tucson.[7][8]\n\nArizona legislature\nElections\nGiffords switched her party affiliation from Republican to Democratic in 2000 and was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2001.[1] She was elected to the Arizona Senate in the fall of 2002, at the time the youngest woman elected to that body. She took office in January 2003 and was re-elected in 2004. She resigned from the Arizona Senate on December 1, 2005, in preparation for her congressional campaign.\n\nTenure\nIn early 2005, Giffords observed that \"the 2004 election took its toll on our bipartisan coalition\" and that as a result \"a number of significant problems will receive far less attention than they deserve.\" She highlighted among these, the lack of high-paying jobs or necessary infrastructure, rapid growth, and inward migration that threatened the environment and \"strain[ed]\u00a0... education, health care, and transportation\", and unresolved problems such as Students First; Arnold v. Sarn; repayments due under Ladewig v. Arizona; the No Child Left Behind mandate; low educational achievement; health care costs; and the demands of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. She said that Arizona was not alone in facing such challenges.[9]\nExpanding health care access was an issue pursued by Giffords when she served in the legislature. She also pushed for bills related to mental health and was named by the Mental Health Association of Arizona as the 2004 Legislator of the Year. Giffords earned the Sierra Club's Most Valuable Player award.[10]\nIn the legislature, Giffords worked on the bipartisan Children's Caucus, which sought to improve education and health care for Arizona's children. Critics of this plan argued that it amounted to taxpayer-funded daycare. She worked with Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano to promote all-day kindergarten. Giffords supported raising more money for schools \"through sponsorship of supplemental state aid through bonds and tax credits that could be used for school supplies.\" She was awarded Arizona Family Literacy's Outstanding Legislator for 2003.[11]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nGiffords in 2008\nElections\n2006\nSee also: 2006 Arizona's 8th congressional district election\nGiffords launched her first candidacy for the U.S.\u00a0Congress on January 24, 2006. The campaign received national attention early on as a likely pick-up for the Democratic Party. Prominent Democrats, including Tom Daschle, Robert Reich, Janet Napolitano, and Bill Clinton, endorsed her. EMILY's List endorsed Giffords early in the campaign cycle.[12] The Sierra Club and the Arizona Education Association also endorsed her.[13] On September 12, 2006, Giffords won her party's nomination in the primary election.\nHer Republican opponent in the general election was Randy Graf, a conservative former state senator known for his enforcement-only position on immigration and illegal aliens. Graf had run against Jim Kolbe in the 2004\u00a0GOP primary and had announced his candidacy in 2006 before Kolbe announced his retirement. The Republican establishment was somewhat cool toward Graf, believing he might be too conservative for the district. The national GOP took the unusual step of endorsing one of the more moderate candidates in the primary. Graf won anyway, helped by a split in the Republican moderate vote between two candidates.\nNot long after the primary, Congressional Quarterly changed its rating of the race to \"Leans Democrat\". By late September, the national GOP had pulled most of its funding, effectively conceding the seat to Giffords. Giffords won the race on November 7, 2006, with 54 percent of the vote. Graf received 42 percent. The rest of the vote went to minor candidates. Giffords's victory was portrayed as evidence that Americans are accepting towards comprehensive immigration reform.[14] She was the first Jewish woman elected to Congress from Arizona.[15][16]\n\n2008\nSee also: 2008 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona \u00a7\u00a0District 8\nIn 2008, Giffords was elected to a second term. Republican Tim Bee, a childhood classmate and former colleague in the Arizona State Senate, ran against her. Bee was the President of the Arizona State Senate and considered a strong challenger in this race. Despite native son John McCain's running as the Republican presidential candidate, Giffords was reelected with 56.20 percent of the vote to Bee's 41.45 percent.[17]\n\n2010\nGiffords during a press conference following her 2010 election victory\nSee also: 2010 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona \u00a7\u00a0District 8\nOn November 5, 2010, Giffords was declared the victor after a close race against Republican Jesse Kelly.[18] Kelly, an Iraq War veteran (and not related to Mark Kelly), was listed as a top-ten Tea Party candidate to watch by Politico, and described by The Arizona Republic as highly conservative even compared to Sarah Palin.[19] Giffords had been targeted for defeat by Sarah Palin's political action committee, SarahPAC.[20]\nGiffords participated in the reading of the United States Constitution on the floor of the House of Representatives on January 6, 2011; she read the First Amendment.[21][22]\n\nTenure\nGiffords in 2008\nFollowing the November 2006 election, Giffords was sworn in as a congresswoman on January 3, 2007. She was the third woman in Arizona's history to be elected to serve in the U.S.\u00a0Congress. In her inaugural speech on the floor of the House of Representatives, Giffords advocated a comprehensive immigration reform package, including modern technology to secure the border, more border patrol agents, tough employer sanctions for businesses that knowingly hire illegal immigrants, and a guest-worker program.[23] In her first month in office, Giffords voted in favor of increased federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research;[24] raising the minimum wage;[25] endorsing the 9/11 Commission recommendations;[25] new rules for the House of Representatives targeting ethical issues;[26] and the repeal of $14\u00a0billion of subsidies to big oil companies, in favor of renewable energy subsidies and the founding of the Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve.[25]\nDuring the 2007 session of Congress, Giffords introduced a bill (H.R. 1441)[27] that forbids the sale of F-14 aircraft parts on the open market to prevent them from being acquired by Iran.[28] Giffords advocated for a national day of recognition for cowboys as one of her first actions.[29] She voted for the contentious May 2007 Iraq Emergency Supplemental Spending bill, saying, \"I cannot, in good conscience, allow the military to run out of money while American servicemen and women are being attacked every day\".[30] She has also been a Girl Scout supporter for many years. On April 21, 2007, Giffords hosted her third \"Congress on Your Corner\" in Tucson, Arizona, and kicked things off by speaking to the Girl Scouts of Southern Arizona, Sahuaro Council.\nGiffords was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and the New Democrat Coalition. She was a co-founder of the Congressional Motorcycle Safety Caucus. Until her husband's retirement, she was the only member of the U.S.\u00a0Congress whose spouse was an active duty member of the U.S. military. She is also known as a strong proponent of solar energy as well as for her work to secure the Mexico\u2013United States border.[31][32]\n\nCommittee assignments\nCommittee on Armed Services\nSubcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces\nSubcommittee on Readiness\nCommittee on Science, Space and Technology\nSubcommittee on Space and Aeronautics (Ranking Member)\nSubcommittee on Technology and Innovation\nAttempted assassination\nSee also: 2011 Tucson shooting\nRoadside sign at the scene of the shooting\nOn January 8, 2011, Giffords was shot in the head[33] outside a Safeway grocery store in Casas Adobes, Arizona, a suburban area northwest of Tucson, during her first \"Congress on Your Corner\" (a public opportunity for constituents to speak directly with their representatives)[34] gathering of the year.[35] A man ran up to the crowd and began firing a 9mm pistol with a 33-round magazine,[36][37] hitting 19 people,[38] and killing six, among them federal judge John Roll and 9-year-old child Christina-Taylor Green, who was the granddaughter of MLB baseball manager and GM Dallas Green.[39][40][41] A 20th person was injured at the scene, but not by gunfire.[33][38]\nThe shooter, Jared Lee Loughner,[42] was detained by bystanders until he was taken into police custody.[43][44] Federal officials charged Loughner on the next day with killing federal government employees, attempting to assassinate a member of Congress, and attempting to kill federal employees.[45][46][47] After eventually facing more than 50 federal criminal charges, Loughner pleaded guilty to 19 of them in a plea bargain to avoid a death sentence.[48]\nGiffords's intern, Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez Jr., provided first-aid assistance to her immediately after she was wounded, and is credited with saving her life.[49] She was quickly evacuated to the University Medical Center of Tucson in critical condition,[50] though she was still conscious and \"following commands\".[33]\nOn the same day doctors performed emergency surgery to extract skull fragments and a small amount of necrotic tissue from her brain.[51] The bullet passed through Giffords's head without crossing the midline of the brain, where the most critical injuries typically result.[33] Part of her skull was removed to avoid further damage to the brain from pressure caused by swelling.[52] Doctors who first treated Giffords said the bullet entered the back of her head and exited through the front of her skull, but physicians later concluded that it had traveled in the opposite direction.[53]\nUpon receiving a call from a staffer about Giffords's injury, her husband Mark Kelly and his daughters flew in a friend's aircraft directly from Houston to Tucson.[54][55]\n\nRecovery\nGiffords was initially placed in an induced coma to allow her brain to rest. She was able to respond to simple commands when periodically awakened, but was unable to speak as she was on a ventilator.[56] Nancy Pelosi said Giffords's husband Mark Kelly acknowledged that there is a \"rough road ahead\" for his wife's recovery, but was encouraged by her responsiveness,[57] which included the ability to signal with her hand and move both arms.[58] U.S. Army neurologist Geoffrey Ling of the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, was sent to Tucson to consult on Giffords's condition. Ling stated, \"Her prognosis for maintaining the function that she has is very good. It's over 50 percent.\"[59] On January 11, neurosurgeon G. Michael Lemole Jr. said that Giffords's sedation had been reduced and that she could breathe on her own.[60] On January 12, President Barack Obama visited Giffords at the medical center and publicly stated in an evening memorial ceremony that she had \"opened her eyes for the first time\" that day.[61] Shortly after the shootings, some questions were raised by the media as to whether Giffords could be removed from office under a state law that allows a public office to be declared vacant if the officeholder is absent for three months, but a spokesperson for the Arizona secretary of state said the statute \"doesn't apply to federal offices\" and was, therefore, not relevant.[62]\nAs Giffords's status improved, by mid-January she began simple physical therapy,[63] including sitting up with the assistance of hospital staff and moving her legs upon command.[63][55] On January 15, surgeons performed a tracheotomy, replacing the ventilator tube with a smaller one inserted through Giffords's throat to assist independent breathing.[64][65] Ophthalmologist Lynn Polonski surgically repaired Giffords's damaged eye socket,[66] with additional reconstructive surgery to follow.[67] Giffords's condition improved from \"critical\" to \"serious\" on January 17,[68] and to \"good\" on January 25.[69] She was transferred on January 21 to the Memorial Hermann Medical Center in Houston, Texas, where she subsequently moved to the TIRR Memorial Hermann to undergo a program of physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy.[69][70] Medical experts' initial assessment in January was that Giffords's recovery could take from several months to more than one year.[71] Upon her arrival in Houston, her doctors were optimistic, saying she has \"great rehabilitation potential\".[72]\nOn March 12, 2011, Giffords's husband informed her that six other people had been killed in the attack on her, but he did not identify who they were until months later.[73] In late April, Giffords's doctors reported that her physical, cognitive, and language production abilities had improved significantly, placing her in the top 5 percent of patients recovering from similar injuries.[74] She was walking under supervision with perfect control of her left arm and leg, and able to write with her left hand. She was able to read and understand, and spoke in short phrases. With longer efforts, she was able to produce more complex sentences.[74]\nFrom early in her recovery, Giffords's husband had expressed confidence that she would be able to travel to the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, to witness the launch of his final Space Shuttle mission, STS-134, which was scheduled for April 2011.[75] On April 25, Giffords's doctors cleared her for travel to Florida for the launch, scheduled for April 29. She went to Florida to watch from a private family area with no public appearance or photography. The launch of STS-134 was delayed due to mechanical problems, and Giffords and Kelly returned to Houston after meeting with President Obama, who had also planned to see the launch with his family at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).[76][77]\nAfter continuing her rehabilitation therapy in Houston,[78][79] Giffords returned to KSC for her husband's launch on May 16, 2011. Kelly wore his wife's wedding ring into space, which she had exchanged for his.[80]\n\nAugust 1, 2011: Giffords's first appearance in the House of Representatives since her attempted assassination\nGiffords underwent cranioplasty surgery on May 18, 2011, to replace the part of her skull that had been removed in January to permit her brain to swell after the gunshot to her head. Surgeons replaced the bone with a piece of molded hard plastic, fixed with tiny screws. They expected that her skull would eventually fuse with the porous plastic. From that point, Giffords no longer needed to wear the helmet that she had been wearing to protect her brain from further injury.[81][82] On June 9, 2011, her aide Pia Carusone announced that while Giffords's comprehension appeared to be \"close to normal, if not normal\", she was not yet using complete sentences.[83] On June 12, two photos of Giffords taken on May 17 were released, the first since the shooting.[84] On June 15, Giffords was released from the hospital to return home, where she continued speech, music, physical and occupational therapy.[85] Having learned the French horn as a child, she picked it up again as part of her music therapy and in August 2020 spoke about that experience in a speech endorsing Joe Biden's presidential bid.[86]\nOn August 1, 2011, she made her return to the House floor to vote in favor of raising the debt limit ceiling. She was met with a standing ovation and accolades from her fellow members of Congress.[87] A Giffords spokesman, Mark Kimble, stated in August 2011 that the congresswoman was walking without a cane and was writing left-handed, as she did not have full use of her right side.[88] On October 6, Giffords traveled to Washington for her husband's retirement ceremony, where she presented him with the Distinguished Flying Cross medal. She returned to her husband's Texas home.[89] On October 25, 2011, she travelled to Asheville, North Carolina, for intensive rehabilitation treatments, ending November 4.[90] In Kelly's memoir, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope, released in November 2011, he reported that Giffords would return to Congress. As of 2016[update], she continued to struggle with language and had lost fifty percent of her vision in both eyes.[73]\n\nResignation from Congress\nGiffords embracing President Obama at the 2012 State of the Union Address\nOn January 22, 2012, Giffords announced in a video statement that she intended to resign her seat so that she could focus on her recovery.[91] She attended President Obama's 2012 State of the Union Address on January 24, and formally submitted her resignation on January 25. Appearing on the floor of the House, after the last bill she sponsored was brought to a vote and unanimously passed, Giffords was lauded by members of Congress and the majority and minority leaders who spoke in tribute to her strength and accomplishment in an unusual farewell ceremony. Her letter of resignation was read on her behalf by her close friend and fellow Democratic representative, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.[92][93]\n\nPost-congressional activities\nGiffords being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden in July 2022\nA joint memoir by Giffords and her husband, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope, with co-author Jeffrey Zaslow, was published on November 15, 2011.[94][95] Giffords and Kelly were interviewed by ABC's Diane Sawyer in their first joint interview since the shooting, which aired on a special edition of 20/20 on November 14, 2011, in conjunction with the book's publication.[96]\nGiffords has made appearances at the three Democratic National Conventions held since she left congress. On September 6, 2012, Giffords led the Pledge of Allegiance at that evening's meeting of the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[97] At the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Giffords delivered a speech in support of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.[98] For the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Giffords delivered a speech supporting presidential nominee Joe Biden and urging action on gun control.[99]\nAfter her shooting, Giffords became an advocate for anti-gun-violence causes. In 2013, shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Giffords and her husband founded the nonprofit and super PAC Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS) to support pro-gun control candidates.[100] In 2017 the organization was reorganized, becoming Giffords.[101]\nIn January 2013, Giffords still had difficulty speaking and walking, and her right arm was paralyzed. She continued to undergo speech and physical therapy.[102]\nOn January 8, 2014, Giffords marked the third anniversary of the shooting by going skydiving. Giffords said on an interview with the Today show, \"Oh, wonderful sky. Gorgeous mountain. Blue skies. I like a lot. A lot of fun. Peaceful, so peaceful.\"[103][104]\nThe White House awarded Giffords the Presidential Medal of Freedom on July 7, 2022.[105] She was the Grand Marshal of the 2023 Rose Parade and presided over the Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl game.[106]\n\nPersonal life\nGiffords with husband Mark Kelly\nGiffords married U.S. Navy captain and NASA astronaut Mark Kelly on November 10, 2007. Kelly was the Space Shuttle's pilot on the STS-108 and STS-121 missions, was the commander of STS-124 and STS-134,[107] and became a U.S. Senator for Arizona in 2020.\nGiffords is a former member of the Arizona regional board of the Anti-Defamation League.[108] After Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005, Giffords spent time as a volunteer in Houston, Texas, in relief efforts for hurricane victims. She wrote about her experience in the Tucson Citizen.[109]\nGiffords is an avid reader, and was featured on NPR's Weekend Edition on July 9, 2006, talking about her love of books.[110] She was periodically interviewed in 2007 together with Illinois Republican Peter Roskam on NPR's All Things Considered.[111] The series focused on their experiences as freshman members of the 110th Congress.[112]\n\nPolitical positions\nEconomy\nGiffords voted against President Bush's Economic Stimulus Act of 2008.[29] Giffords was one of 60 lawmakers who voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 during its first House vote before switching to a yes vote in its second House vote,[113] and she voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[114]\nIn August 2011, she voted in favor of raising the debt ceiling.[87]\n\nEducation\nGiffords argues that Americans are competing on a global level and that this competition starts in the classroom. She is a critic of the No Child Left Behind law, viewing it as an unfunded federal mandate. She supports public schools and their improved efficiency.[115]\n\nEnergy\nGiffords strongly supports renewable energy, in particular solar energy, as a top public policy priority.[116]\nIn September 2007, she published a report titled: The Community Solar Energy Initiative, Solar Energy in Southern Arizona, observing that Arizona has enough sunshine to power the entire United States. It reviews current energy usage and discusses how to increase the production of solar electricity.[117] On August 1, 2008, she wrote to congressional leaders regarding tax credits that were set to expire, saying that failure to extend the scheme would be extremely harmful to the renewable energy industry \"just as it is beginning to take off\".[118]\n\nImmigration and border security\nRepresentative Giffords speaking with a military officer in July 2010\nDuring Giffords's tenure in the House, Arizona's 8th congressional district was one of ten in the country bordering Mexico. Giffords has stated that the Arizona SB 1070 legislation is a \"clear calling that the federal government needs to do a better job\"[119] and says that she hopes the legislation acts as a wake-up call to the federal government. However, she stopped short of supporting the law itself, saying that it \"does nothing to secure our border\" and that it \"stands in direct contradiction to our past and, as a result, threatens our future\". She also claimed that SB1070 kept Arizona from attracting students and businesses.[120]\nOn August 31, 2010, Giffords praised the arrival of National Guard troops on the border: \"Arizonans have waited a long time for the deployment of the National Guard in our state. Their arrival represents a renewed national commitment to protecting our border communities from drug cartels and smugglers.\"[121]\nGiffords worked to secure passage of the August 2010 bill to fund more Border Patrol agents and surveillance technology for Arizona's border with Mexico. The legislation passed the House of Representatives only to be sent back by the U.S. Senate with reduced funding. Ultimately a $600-million bill was passed and signed into law. The bill was over $100\u00a0million less than Giffords fought for, but she said, \"This funding signals a stronger federal commitment to protect those Americans who live and work near the border.\"[122]\nIn 2008, Giffords introduced legislation that would have increased the cap on the H-1B visa from 65,000 per year to 130,000 per year.[123] If that were not sufficient, according to her legislation, the cap would have been increased to 180,000 per year.[citation needed] The bill would have allowed, at most, 50% of employees at any given company with at least 50 employees to be H-1B guest workers.[124] Giffords said the bill would help high-tech companies in southern Arizona, some of which rely on H-1B employees.[124] However, Giffords's bill was never voted on by the House of Representatives.\n\nGun control\nIn 2008, before being shot, Giffords opposed prohibitions in Washington, D.C., on the possession of handguns in the home and having usable firearms there, signing an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller to support its overturn.[125]\nIn January 2013, Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly started a political action committee called Americans for Responsible Solutions whose mission is to promote gun-control legislation with elected officials and the general public. The couple supports \"keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people like criminals, terrorists, and the mentally ill\".[126]\nOther proposals from Giffords and Kelly include limiting the sale of certain magazines, limiting the sale of assault weapons, and stopping gun trafficking.\nGiffords was a surprise witness at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence on January 30, 2013.[127] In a halting voice, she called for Congress to pass tougher laws on guns, saying \"too many children are dying.\" Giffords is right-handed; her speech therapist had to write out her statement for her since her right arm was paralyzed in the shooting.[102]\nIn 2017, after the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 and injured 546, she implored lawmakers to take action, saying she \"knows the horror of gun violence all too well\".[128][129][130][131]\nIn 2020 she spoke on the third night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, urging action on gun control. She worked with a speech therapist for months in preparation for the speech, and also performed \"America\" on the French horn, an instrument she had played as a teen, as a symbol of her recovery.[99]\nIn 2023, Giffords at the end of an interview said \"No more guns,\" and plans to achieve that by \"Legislation, legislation, legislation.\"[132]\n\nNaming honors\nMain article: USS Gabrielle Giffords\nIt was announced by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, on February 10, 2012, that the next U.S. Navy littoral combat ship would be named USS\u00a0Gabrielle Giffords\u00a0(LCS-10). Giffords, still recovering from injuries sustained in the 2011 assassination attempt, attended the ship's keel-laying ceremony and etched her initials into a plate welded into the ship.[133]\nUSS Gabrielle Giffords was christened at the Austal USA shipyard in Mobile, Alabama, on June 13, 2015.[134][135] Giffords attended the christening ceremony, along with Second Lady of the United States Jill Biden, who served as the ship's sponsor.[134][135] The ship was commissioned on June 12, 2017, at Port of Galveston, Texas.[136]\nSome commentators have noted that several ships in the U.S. Navy, including Henry M. Jackson, Carl Vinson, John C. Stennis, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush were named for prominent politicians who were still alive at the time of the naming.[137][138] A subsequent Navy report on the naming noted that Secretary Mabus considered honoring Giffords and other victims of the Tucson shooting by naming LCS-10 after the city of Tucson, consistent with current practice of naming littoral combat ships for U.S. cities, but this was not possible because USS\u00a0Tucson, an active Los Angeles-class submarine, currently bears the name.[139]\n\nElectoral history\n\nArizona's 8th Congressional District House Election, 2006\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\u00b1%\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nGabrielle Giffords\n\n137,655\n\n54.26%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nRandy Graf\n\n106,790\n\n42.09%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibertarian\n\nDavid F.

In 2001, she was named the paper's first female Editorial Page Editor, a position she held for six years. She resigned from this post at the beginning of 2007 to take a six-month leave to focus on writing her book When Everything Changed: The Amazing Journey of American Women from 1960 to the Present, returning to the Times as a regular columnist in July 2007.[2]\nBeyond her work as a journalist, Collins has published several books: The Millennium Book, which she co-authored with her husband, CBS News producer Dan Collins; Scorpion Tongues: Gossip, Celebrity and American Politics; America's Women: Four Hundred Years of Dolls, Drudges, Helpmates, and Heroines; the aforementioned When Everything Changed; and As Texas Goes: How the Lone Star State Hijacked the American Agenda.[2][11][12] She also wrote the introduction for the 50th-anniversary edition of The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan; the 50th-anniversary edition was published in 2013.[13] In 2019, her book No Stopping Us Now: The Adventures of Older Women in American History was published.[14]\nCollins taught journalism at Southern Connecticut State University from 1977 to 1979; and from fall 2009 until 2012, she co-taught (with Seth Lipsky) an opinion writing course at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.[11] She has been a frequent guest on NPR and on Jon Wiener's podcast, Start Making Sense.[15][16]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Collins on America's Women, December 14, 2003, C-SPAN Washington Journal interview with Collins on When Everything Changed, October 20, 2009, C-SPAN After Words interview with Collins on When Everything Changed, January 2, 2010, C-SPAN Discussion with Collins on As Texas Goes...', June 10, 2012, C-SPAN Interview with Collins on When Everything Changed, January 15, 2017, C-SPAN Interview with Collins on Now Stopping Us Now, September 26, 2020, C-SPAN\nWith Dan Collins: The Millennium Book.

For the golfer, see George Will (golfer).\n\n\nGeorge WillWill in 2022BornGeorge Frederick Will (1941-05-04) May 4, 1941 (age\u00a082)Champaign, Illinois, U.S.EducationTrinity College (BA)Magdalen College, Oxford (MA)Princeton University (MA, PhD)OccupationsColumnistauthorEmployer(s)NewsweekThe Washington PostPolitical partyRepublican (before 2016)Independent (after 2016)Spouses\n\nMadeleine Will\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01967; div.\u00a01989)\u200b\n\nMari Maseng \u200b(m.\u00a01991)\u200b\nChildren4AwardsPulitzer Prize for Commentary (1977)\nGeorge Frederick Will (born May 4, 1941) is an American libertarian conservative writer and political commentator, who writes regular columns for The Washington Post and provides commentary for NewsNation.[1]\nIn 1986, The Wall Street Journal called him \"perhaps the most powerful journalist in America.\"[2][3] Will won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1977.[4]\nA former member of the Republican Party, Will was a close ally of Ronald Reagan during his presidential campaign in 1980. He assisted Reagan with debate preparation, and was later falsely accused by former President Jimmy Carter of providing Reagan with a top secret briefing book in a scandal known as Debategate, in an allegation Carter later retracted. \nIn later years, he became a critic of Republican politicians, including Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, and Donald Trump. Will's disapproval of Trump's presidential campaign led him to become an independent in 2016,[5] and he subsequently voted for Joe Biden in 2020.[6]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nWill was born on May 4, 1941, in Champaign, Illinois, to Louise (n\u00e9e Hendrickson) and Frederick L. Will.[7] His father was a professor of philosophy, specializing in epistemology, at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign. Will attended University Laboratory High School of Urbana, Illinois, where he graduated in 1959.\nAfter high school, Will went to Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, graduating in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in religion. He then went to England and attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics and received a bachelor's degree (promoted to a master's per tradition). Will then did doctoral study in political science at Princeton University, receiving a PhD in 1968 with a dissertation entitled \"Beyond the Reach of Majorities: Closed Questions in the Open Society\", alluding to a famous phrase from Justice Robert H. Jackson\u2019s majority opinion in the landmark 1943 Supreme Court case West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette.[8]\nFrom 1970 to 1972, he served on the staff of Republican Senator Gordon Allott of Colorado. Will then taught political philosophy at the James Madison College of Michigan State University, and at the University of Toronto. He taught at Harvard University in 1995 and again in 1998.\n\nJournalism career[edit]\nWill in 2014\nWill originally had left wing political views, but his views shifted toward conservatism during his studies at Oxford, especially after visiting Communist-controlled East Berlin in the mid-1960s.[9]  Will served as an editor for National Review from 1972 to 1978.[10] He joined  The Washington Post Writers Group in 1974, writing a syndicated biweekly column, which became widely circulated among newspapers across the country and continues today. As of December\u00a02014,[update] his column is syndicated to about 450 newspapers.[11] In 1976 he became a contributing editor for Newsweek, writing a biweekly backpage column until 2011.[12]\nWill won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for \"distinguished commentary on a variety of topics\" in 1977.[13] Often combining factual reporting with conservative commentary, Will's columns are known for their erudite vocabulary, allusions to political philosophers, and frequent references to baseball.[citation needed]\nWill has also written two bestselling books on the game of baseball, three books on political philosophy, and has published eleven compilations of his columns for The Washington Post and Newsweek and of various book reviews and lectures.[12]\nFrom 2013 to 2017, Will was a contributor for Fox News.[14][15] Prior to joining Fox News, beginning in the early 1980s, Will was a news analyst for ABC News and was a founding member on the panel of ABC's This Week with David Brinkley in 1981, now titled This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Will was a panelist on This Week until his departure from ABC News. Will was also a regular panelist on television's Agronsky & Company from 1977 through 1984.[12] On Sunday, March 19, 2017, Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd welcomed Will back as a panelist, stating he had been absent from the program since 1981 and that his return would mark his 52nd appearance.[16]\nOn May 8, 2017, Will was announced as an MSNBC and NBC News political contributor, in which he provided regular political input on shows such as Today, Morning Joe, and The 11th Hour.\nOn December 3, 2020, Will received the National Society for Newspaper Columnists 2020 Ernie Pyle Lifetime Achievement Award, in partnership with the Society of Professional Journalists.[17]\nSince January, 2022, Will has been a senior political contributor at NewsNation.[18]\n\n\n1980 Ronald Reagan presidential campaign[edit]\nFurther information: Debategate\nWill helped Ronald Reagan prepare for his 1980 debate against Jimmy Carter. Immediately after the debate, Will\u2014not yet a member of the ABC News staff\u2014appeared on ABC's Nightline. He was introduced by host Ted Koppel, who said: \"It's my understanding that you met for some time yesterday with Governor Reagan\", and that Will \"never made any secret of his affection\" for the Republican candidate. Will did not explicitly disclose that he had assisted Reagan's debate preparation, or been present during it. He went on to praise Reagan's \"thoroughbred\" performance, saying his \"game plan worked well. I don't think he was very surprised.\"[19]\nIn 2004 and again in 2005, Carter accused Will of giving the Reagan campaign a top-secret briefing book stolen from Carter's office before the 1980 debate.[20] In a 2005 syndicated column, Will called his role in Reagan's debate preparation \"inappropriate\" but denied any role in stealing the briefing book.[21] In response to Will's column, Carter wrote a letter to The Washington Post retracting his accusations. Carter apologized to Will for \"any incorrect statement that I have ever made about his role in the use of my briefing book... I have never thought Mr. Will took my book, that the outcome of the debate was damaging to my campaign or that Mr. Will apologized to me.\"[22]\n\n2009 global sea ice level[edit]\nIn a Washington Post column that expressed doubt over the effects of global warming, Will stated that: \"According to the University of Illinois' Arctic Climate Research Center, global sea ice levels now equal those of 1979.\"[23] This and several other claims attracted the attention of environmentalists, such as British author and activist George Monbiot.[24] Asked to respond, the website of Arctic Climate Research at the University of Illinois states that: \"We do not know where George Will is getting his information, but our data shows that on February 15, 1979, global sea ice area was 16.79 million sq. km and on February 15, 2009, global sea ice area was 15.45 million sq. km. Therefore, global sea ice levels are 1.34 million sq. km less in February 2009 than in February 1979.\"[25] Will responded in a column that he accurately reported the Center's information and the challenge was mistaken.[26] This drew a second response from Monbiot, who insisted Will had not accurately reported the Center's information.[27] The debate continued in several forums, including a subsequent op-ed by Chris Mooney published in The Washington Post challenging Will's assertions.[28]\n\nColumn regarding campus assaults[edit]\nWill's June 6, 2014, newspaper column about \"the supposed campus epidemic of rape\" was widely criticized,[29] with Democratic U.S. senators and feminists highly critical of the article. Will wrote, \"...when [colleges and universities] make victimhood a coveted status that confers privileges, victims proliferate.\"[30] Will's column sparked an outcry on Twitter, with professed rape victims recounting their stories of sexual assault and violence.[31] In The Guardian, Jessica Valenti wrote: \"It takes a particular kind of ignorance to argue that people who come forward to report being raped in college are afforded benefits of any kind.\"[32] In an open letter to Will, Senators Richard Blumenthal, Dianne Feinstein, Tammy Baldwin and Bob Casey wrote:\n\nYour column suggests that we \u2014 including some of us who have worked on this issue for many years \u2013 all have missed a subculture on college campuses where survivors of sexual assault are inducted into a privileged class. The culture you described is so antiquated, so counter-intuitive and so contrary to anything we heard that we hope you will make an effort to hear the stories survivors bravely shared with us about the struggles they face in addressing what has happened to them \u2014 often with little meaningful assistance from authorities expected to help them.[33]\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch dropped Will's column from its pages as a result of the column. Editor Tony Messenger wrote: \"The column was offensive and inaccurate; we apologize for publishing it.\"[34] Will responded to the senators in his blog, saying his article was based on \"simple arithmetic involving publicly available reports\", and that sexual assault \"should be dealt with by the criminal justice system, and not be adjudicated by improvised campus processes.\"[35]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nThis article is part of a series onConservatismin the United States\nSchools\nCompassionate\nFiscal\nFusion\nLibertarian\nModerate\nMovement\nNeo\nPaleo\nProgressive\nSocial\nTraditionalist\n\n\nPrinciples\nAmerican exceptionalism\nAnti-communism\nChristian nationalism\nClassical liberalism\nConstitutionalism\nFamily values\nJudeo-Christian values\nLimited government\nMilitarism\nMoral absolutism\nNatural law\nPatriotism\nRepublicanism\nRight to bear arms\nRule of law\nTradition\n\n\nHistory\nConservative coalition\nConservative Democrat\nConservative Manifesto\nLoyalists\nMcCarthyism\nModern timeline\nNew Right\nOld Right\nOverview\nReagan Doctrine\nReaganomics\nStalwart Republicans\nSouthern Agrarians\n\n\nIntellectuals\nBabbitt\nBoorstin\nBozell Jr.\nBuchanan\nBuckley\nBurnham\nChambers\nDolan\nEliot\nGeorge\nGoldberg\nGottfried\nHanson\nHazony\nHoppe\nJaffa\nKirk\nKirkpatrick\nKreeft\nKristol (Bill)\nKristol (Irving)\nKuehnelt-Leddihn\nLaffer\nLasch\nLodge\nLovecraft\nLukacs\nMansfield\nMeese\nMeyer\nNisbet\nNock\nPodhoretz\nRansom\nSantayana\nSowell\nStrauss\nViereck\nVoegelin\nWashington\nWeaver\nWill\n\n\nPoliticians\nAbbott\nAdams\nQuincy Adams\nAgnew\nBuchanan\nBush (George H.

On immigration, Will supports tighter border security and a \"path to citizenship\" for illegal immigrants.[39]\n\nSocial issues[edit]\nWill argued that the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision caused a \"truncation of democratic debate about abortion policy.\"[40] On crime, Will is opposed to the death penalty.[41] He thinks that higher incarceration rates make the populace safer.[42] Additionally, Will is generally skeptical of affirmative action programs.[43] Will favors the legalization of drugs.[44]\n\nEconomic issues[edit]\nWill is a libertarian-style conservative who supports deregulation and low taxes as he thinks these stimulate economic growth and are more morally fair.[45] He was opposed to both George W. Bush and Barack Obama's stimulus plans.[46] Will supports abolishing the minimum wage[47] and creating voluntary personal retirement accounts in order to reduce the federal cost of Social Security.[48] In February 2013, Will wrote in support of a proposal by \"relentlessly liberal\" Sherrod Brown to break up consolidated banks and finance industry conglomerates, ending \"too big to fail\" by restoring the Glass-Steagall Act.[49]\n\nCampaign finance reform[edit]\nWill opposes attempts to regulate campaign funding, arguing that any such legislation is unconstitutional and would unfairly favor incumbent politicians. Additionally, he contends that spending money is a form of free speech and political participation. By giving the government power to regulate speech, Will believes that this will make the government \"even bigger.\" Instead, he believes that we need \"more speech, advocating less government\" in order to reduce the importance of politics in our lives, thus indirectly reducing political spending.[50]\n\nCriticism of Republican politicians[edit]\nWhile identified with conservative politics, Will has criticized a number of individuals and policies associated with the Republican Party and American conservatism. He was among the first to oppose President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to the United States Supreme Court.[51]\nWill was hawkish in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and he expressed reservations about Bush administration Iraq policies. He eventually criticized what he said was an unrealistically optimistic set of political scenarios. In March 2006, in a column written in the aftermath of the apparently sectarian bombing of the Askariya Shrine in Samarra, Will challenged the Bush administration\u2014and U.S. government representatives in Iraq\u2014to be more honest about the difficulties the United States faced in rebuilding and maintaining order within Iraq, comparing the White House's rhetoric unfavorably to that of Winston Churchill during the early years of World War II. Will described the optimistic assessments delivered from the Bush administration as the \"rhetoric of unreality.\"[52] He criticized the Bush Iraq policy, and broader White House and congressional foreign and domestic policy making, in his keynote address for the Cato Institute's 2006 Milton Friedman Prize dinner.[53]\nWill was also a harsh and early critic of both Sarah Palin and John McCain's 2008 election campaign. He criticized Palin's understanding of the role of the Vice President and her qualifications for that role.[54] In late 2011, as the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries approached, Will said that frontrunner Newt Gingrich \"embodies almost everything disagreeable about modern Washington\", and described him as \"the classic rental politician\".[55] In a 2013 interview with Reason writers Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch, Will said his views have gradually but steadily become more libertarian.[56]\nWill criticized Donald Trump several times during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, calling him a \"one-man Todd Akin\", and urged conservative voters to \"help him lose 50 states\u2014condign punishment for his comprehensive disdain for conservative essentials.\"[57] In turn, Trump criticized Will and brought attention to the fact that his wife Mari Maseng Will was an advisor to Scott Walker's presidential campaign.[citation needed] Will criticized Trump again, saying Trump was a bigger threat than Hillary Clinton. In June 2016, citing his disapproval of Trump, Will told journalist Nicholas Ballasy in an interview that he had left the Republican Party and was registered as an unaffiliated voter.[5]\nIn June 2019, Will asserted that the Republican Party had become a cult.[58] In July 2020, Will announced he would vote for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[6]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nFamily[edit]\nWill has three children\u2014Victoria, Geoffrey, and Jonathan\u2014with his first wife, Madeleine;[59] their eldest child,[60] Jonathan, was born in 1972 with Down syndrome, which Will has written about in his column on occasion.[61][62][63] In 1989, he and Madeleine divorced after 22 years of marriage.[64]\nIn 1991, Will married Mari Maseng. They have one child, a son named David, born in 1992, and live in Chevy Chase, Maryland, an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C.[65] Maseng is a political consultant and speechwriter who was in charge of communications for the Rick Perry 2012 presidential campaign, and most recently worked on Scott Walker's 2016 presidential campaign. She earlier worked on Michele Bachmann's 2012 presidential campaign, and offered her services to the Mitt Romney 2012 campaign.[66][67] She previously worked for Ronald Reagan as a presidential speechwriter, deputy director of transportation, and Assistant to the President for Public Liaison. She also was a former communications director for Senator Bob Dole.\n\nReligious beliefs[edit]\nWill is a self-described \"amiable, low-voltage atheist\".[68]  He was for quite a number of years a fairly active member of the Episcopal Church.\n\nInterests[edit]\nWill (at far left) with members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and George W. Bush at the White House in 2004\nWill, a Chicago Cubs fan,[69][70] has written extensively on baseball, including his best-selling book Men at Work: The Craft of Baseball. He was one of the interview subjects for Ken Burns's PBS documentary series Baseball.\n\nReferences in popular culture[edit]\nWill was occasionally lampooned in the comic Doonesbury, particularly in a December 1980 sequence of strips in which several characters attend a party hosted by Will for the Reagans.[71]\nWill was lampooned in a skit on an April 1990 episode of the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. Dana Carvey played Will as the host of the fictional baseball trivia game show George F. Will's Sports Machine, in which the answers are all highflown literary metaphors that leave the contestants befuddled; the exasperated contestants finally get Will to try to throw a baseball, which he is unable to do.[72]\nIn the Seinfeld season 6 episode \"The Jimmy\", Kramer mentions that he finds George Will attractive.[73]\nIn the 30 Rock season 1 episode \"Jack-Tor\", Tracy Jordan remarks while reading a newspaper that George Will \"just gets more and more conservative.\"[74]\n\nHonorary awards and recognition[edit]\nIn addition to more than 16 honorary degrees:\n\n1977: Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\n1978: Headliner Award for consistently outstanding feature columns\n1979: Finalist for National Magazine Award in essays and criticism\n1980: Silurian Award for editorial writing\n1991: Silurian Award for editorial writing\n1991: First Place in Interpretive Columns: Clarion Awards from Women in Communications\n1991: Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.,[75] Arizona State University\n1992: Madison Medal Award, Princeton University\n1993: Honoris Causa initiate of Omicron Delta Kappa at Washington and Lee University\n1993: William Allen White Award, William Allen White School of Journalism at the University of Kansas\n2003: Walter B. Wriston Lecture Award, The Manhattan Institute\n2005: Bradley Prize, The Bradley Foundation[76]\n2006: Champion of Liberty Award, Goldwater Institute[77]\nOn May 18, 2019, The Lincoln Academy of Illinois granted Will the Order of Lincoln award, the highest honor bestowed by the State of Illinois.[78]\nWorks[edit]\nThe Pursuit of Happiness and Other Sobering Thoughts.

He is the CEO, founder, and owner of Mercury Radio Arts, the parent company of his television and radio network TheBlaze. He hosts the Glenn Beck Radio Program, a talk-radio show nationally syndicated on Premiere Radio Networks. Beck also hosts the Glenn Beck television program, which ran from January 2006 to October 2008 on HLN, from January 2009 to June 2011 on Fox News and now airs on TheBlaze. Beck has authored six New York Times\u2013bestselling books.[9]\nIn April 2011, Beck announced that he would \"transition off of his daily program\" on Fox News, but would continue to team with Fox.[10] His last daily show on Fox was June 30, 2011.[11] In 2012, The Hollywood Reporter placed Beck on its Digital Power Fifty list.[12] Beck launched TheBlaze in 2011 after leaving Fox News. He hosts an hour-long afternoon program, The Glenn Beck Program, on weekdays, and a three-hour morning radio show; both are broadcast on TheBlaze. Beck is also the producer of TheBlaze's For the Record.[13]\nBeck has received both praise and criticism, characterized by his supporters as a defender of traditional American values and by his detractors as a demagogue. During Barack Obama's presidency, Beck promoted conspiracy theories about Obama, his administration, George Soros, and others.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nBeck was born in Everett, Washington, the son of Mary Clara (n\u00e9e Janssen) and William Beck, who lived in Mountlake Terrace, Washington, at the time of their son's birth.[14] The family later moved to Mount Vernon, Washington,[15] where they owned and operated a downtown bakery.[15] He is descended from German immigrants who came to the United States in the 19th century.[16] Beck was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended Immaculate Conception Catholic School in Mount Vernon.\nBeck and his sister moved with their mother to Sumner, Washington, attending a Jesuit school[17] in Puyallup. In 1979, when Beck was 15, his mother drowned in Puget Sound while fishing with a man in Commencement Bay west of Tacoma.[18][19] Her companion also drowned; police investigators believed that one of the victims may have fallen overboard and the other drowned in a rescue attempt.[20][19] Beck has called his mother's death a suicide in interviews.[19]\nAfter their mother's death, Beck moved to his father's home in Bellingham, where Beck graduated from Sehome High School in 1982.[21][22] Beck also regularly vacationed with his maternal grandparents, Ed and Clara Janssen, in Iowa.[23] In the aftermath of his mother's death and his stepbrother's subsequent suicide, Beck has said he used \"Dr. Jack Daniel's\" to cope. At 18, after graduating from high school, he moved to Provo, Utah, and worked at radio station KAYK. Feeling he \"didn't fit in\", Beck left Utah after six months,[24] taking a job at Washington, D.C.'s WPGC in February 1983.[19]\n\nPersonal life\nGlenn Beck speaking at Restoring Honor at the Lincoln Memorial\nWhile working at WPGC, Beck met his first wife, Claire.[25] They married in 1983 and had two daughters, Mary and Hannah. Mary developed cerebral palsy as a result of a series of strokes at birth in 1988.[25] The couple divorced in 1994 amid Beck's struggles with substance abuse. He is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict,[26] and has said he has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[27][28][29]\nBy 1994, Beck was suicidal, and imagined shooting himself to the music of Kurt Cobain.[28] He credits Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) with helping him achieve sobriety. He said he stopped drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis in November 1994, the same month he attended his first AA meeting.[28] Beck later said that he had gotten high every day for the previous 15 years, since the age of 16.[19]\nIn 1996, while working for a New Haven area radio station, Beck took a theology class at Yale University, with a written recommendation from Senator Joe Lieberman, a Yale alumnus who was a fan of Beck's show at the time.[30] Beck enrolled in an \"Early Christology\" course, but soon withdrew, marking the extent of his post-secondary education.[28][31]\n\nIsraeli citizens holding banner at the Jerusalem Restoring Courage rally, in which Beck was the main speaker\nBeck then began a \"spiritual quest\" in which he \"sought out answers in churches and bookstores\".[28] As he later recounted in his books and stage performances, Beck's first attempt at self-education involved reading the work of six wide-ranging authors, constituting what Beck jokingly calls \"the library of a serial killer\": Alan Dershowitz, Pope John Paul II, Adolf Hitler, Billy Graham, Carl Sagan, and Friedrich Nietzsche.[30] During this time, Beck's Mormon friend and former radio partner Pat Gray argued in favor of the \"comprehensive worldview\" offered by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an offer that Beck rejected until a few years later.[28] (Later, after moving to the New York City area, he had a consultation with Graham, which he said affected him strongly.[32]\nIn 1999, Beck married his second wife, Tania.[28] After they went looking for a faith on a church tour together,[28] they joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in October 1999, partly at the urging of his daughter Mary.[33][34] Beck was baptized by Pat Gray.[28] Beck and Tania have two children together. Until April 2011, the couple lived in New Canaan, Connecticut, with the four children.[35][36]\nIn July 2010, Beck announced that he had been diagnosed with macular dystrophy, saying, \"A couple of weeks ago I went to the doctor because of my eyes. I can't focus my eyes. He did all kinds of tests and he said, 'you have macular dystrophy ... you could go blind in the next year. Or, you might not.'\" The disorder can make it difficult to read, drive or recognize faces.[37]\nIn July 2011, Beck leased a house in the Fort Worth suburb of Westlake, Texas.[38] The Blaze was based in Irving, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, since 2011.[39]\nOn November 10, 2014, Beck announced on TheBlaze that he had been suffering from a severe neurological disorder for at least the last five years. He described many strong and debilitating symptoms that made it difficult for him to work,[40] and also announced that he had \"a string of health issues that quite honestly made me look crazy, and quite honestly, I have felt crazy because of them\".[41] Beck said that a chiropractor who specializes in \"chiropractic neurology\", Frederick Carrick, had \"diagnosed [him] with several health issues, including an autoimmune disorder, which he didn't name, and adrenal fatigue.\" Over 10 months he had received a series of treatments and felt better.[42] On January 13, 2022, Beck announced that his second case of COVID-19 was \"getting into my lungs\".[43]\n\nCareer\n\n\nGlenn Beck has managed to monetize virtually everything that comes out of his mouth.\n\n\n\u2013Forbes, April 2010[9][44]\n\n\nIn 2002, Beck created the media platform Mercury Radio Arts[30][45] as the umbrella over his broadcast, publishing, Internet, and live show interests. Beck founded Mercury Radio Arts in 2002, naming it after the Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre, which produced live radio broadcasts during the 1930s. The company produces all of Beck's productions, including his eponymous radio show, books, live stage shows, and his official website.[46][47]\n\nRadio\nSee also: Glenn Beck Radio Program\nIn 1983, Beck moved to Corpus Christi, Texas, to work at radio station KZFM.[25] In mid-1985, he was hired away from KZFM to be the lead DJ for WRKA's morning-drive radio broadcast in Louisville, Kentucky.[25] His four-hour weekday show was called Captain Beck and the A-Team.[48] Beck had a reputation as a \"young up-and-comer\". The show was not political and included the genre's usual off-color antics: juvenile jokes, pranks, and impersonations.[30] It slipped to third in the market and Beck left abruptly in 1987 amid a dispute with WRKA management.[49]\nMonths later, Beck was hired by Phoenix Top-40 station KOY-FM, then known as Y-95. Beck was partnered with Arizona native Tim Hattrick to co-host a local \"morning zoo\" program.[28] During his time at Y-95, Beck cultivated a rivalry with local pop radio station KZZP and that station's morning host Bruce Kelly. Through practical jokes and publicity stunts, Beck drew criticism from the staff at Y-95 when the rivalry culminated in Beck telephoning Kelly's wife on the air, mocking her recent miscarriage.[25] In 1989, Beck resigned from Y-95 to accept a job in Houston at KRBE, known as Power 104. He was fired in 1990 due to poor ratings.[25]\nBeck then moved to Baltimore, Maryland, and the city's leading Top-40 station, WBSB, known as B104. There, he partnered with Pat Gray, a morning DJ. During his tenure at B104, Beck was arrested and jailed for speeding in his DeLorean.[28] According to a former associate, Beck was \"completely out of it\" when a station manager went to bail him out.[28] After Gray and Beck were fired, they spent six months in Baltimore, planning their next move. In early 1992, they moved to WKCI-FM (KC101), a Top-40 radio station in New Haven, Connecticut.[28] In 1995, WKCI apologized after Beck and Gray mocked a Chinese-American caller on air who felt offended by a comedy segment by playing a gong sound effect and having executive producer Alf Gatineau mock a Chinese accent. That incident led to protests by activist groups.[50] When Gray left the show to move to Salt Lake City, Beck continued with co-host Vinnie Penn. At the end of 1998, Beck was informed that his contract would not be renewed at the end of 1999.[28]\nThe Glenn Beck Program first aired in 2000 on WFLA (AM) in Tampa, and took its afternoon time slot from 18th to first place within a year.[51][52] In January 2002, Premiere Radio Networks launched the show nationwide on 47 stations. The show then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, broadcasting from new flagship station WPHT. On November 5, 2007, The New York Times reported that Premiere Radio Networks was extending Beck's contract. By May 2008, it had reached over 280 terrestrial stations as well as XM Satellite. It was ranked fourth in the nation with over 6.5 million listeners.[53] As of July\u00a02013[update], Beck was tied for fourth in the ratings, behind Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Dave Ramsey.[54]\n\nTelevision\nSee also: Glenn Beck (TV program)\nIn January 2006, CNN's Headline News announced that Beck would host a nightly news-commentary show in its new prime-time block Headline Prime. The show, simply called Glenn Beck, aired weeknights. CNN Headline News called the show \"an unconventional look at the news of the day featuring his often amusing perspective\".[55] At the end of his tenure at CNN-HLN, Beck had the second-largest audience, behind Nancy Grace.[56] In 2008, he won the Marconi Radio Award for Network Syndicated Personality of the Year.[8]\nIn October 2008, it was announced that Beck would join the Fox News Channel, leaving CNN Headline News.[57] After moving to Fox, Beck hosted Glenn Beck, beginning in January 2009, as well as a weekend version.[58] One of his first guests was Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[59] He also had a regular segment on Fridays, \"At Your Beck and Call\", on the Fox News Channel program The O'Reilly Factor.[60] As of September\u00a02009[update], Beck's program drew more viewers than all three competing time-slot shows combined on CNN, MSNBC and HLN.[61][62]\nBeck's show's high ratings did not come without controversy.[57] The Washington Post's Howard Kurtz reported that Beck's use of \"distorted or inflammatory rhetoric\" had complicated the channel's and its journalists' efforts to neutralize White House criticism that Fox is not really a news organization.[57] Television analyst Andrew Tyndall echoed these sentiments, saying that Beck's incendiary style had created \"a real crossroads for Fox News\", saying, \"they're right on the cusp of losing their image as a news organization.\"[57]\nIn April 2011, Fox News and Mercury Radio Arts, Beck's production company, announced that Beck would \"transition off of his daily program\" on Fox News in 2011.[63] His last day at Fox was later announced as June 30.[64][65] FNC and Beck announced that he would team with Fox to produce a slate of projects for Fox News and its digital properties.[10] Fox News head Roger Ailes later referenced Beck's entrepreneurialism and political movement activism, saying, \"His [Beck's] goals were different from our goals ... I need people focused on a daily television show.\"[66] Beck hosted his last daily show on Fox on June 30, 2011, when he recounted the accomplishments of the show and said, \"This show has become a movement. It's not a TV show, and that's why it doesn't belong on television anymore. It belongs in your homes. It belongs in your neighborhoods.\"[11] In response to critics who said he was fired, Beck pointed out that his final show was airing live.[11] Immediately after the show he did an interview on his new GBTV internet television channel.[11]\n\nTheBlaze TV (formerly GBTV)\nMain article: TheBlaze TV\nBeck's Fox News one-hour show ended on June 30, 2011,[67] and a new two-hour show began his television network, which started as a subscription-based internet TV network, TheBlaze TV, originally called GBTV, on September 12, 2011.[68][69] Using a subscription model, it was estimated that Beck was on track to generate $27 million in his first year of operation.[70] This was later upgraded to $40 million by The Wall Street Journal when subscriptions topped 300,000.[71]\n\nBooks\nMercury Ink has a co-publishing deal with Simon & Schuster and was founded by Glenn Beck in 2011 as the publishing imprint of Mercury Radio Arts.[72] Started in 2011, Mercury Ink publishes adult and young adult novels and non-fiction titles. Authors signed to Mercury Ink include Beck and New York Times best seller Richard Paul Evans.\nBeck has reached No. 1 on The New York Times Bestseller List in four separate categories as of 2010[update]: Hardcover Non-Fiction,[73][74] Paperback Non-Fiction,[73] Hardcover Fiction,[75] and Children's Picture Books.[76]\nBeck has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss's book Tools of Titans.\n\nStage shows and speeches\n\n\nWhen Beck meets his fans, he does so with the gusto of a public figure engaging his constituents. People he meets often give him presents and notes. He signs autographs, poses for photos. He has perfected the Everyman shtick that presidential candidates spend years trying to master in places like Iowa.\n\n\n\u2013The New York Times Magazine, 2010[30]\n\n\nSince 2005, Beck has toured American cities twice a year, presenting a one-man stage show. His stage productions are a mix of stand-up comedy and inspirational speaking. In a critique of his live act, Salon magazine's Steve Almond describes Beck as a \"wildly imaginative performer, a man who weds the operatic impulses of the demagogue to the grim mutterings of the conspiracy theorist\".[77] A show from the Beck '08 Unelectable Tour was shown in around 350 U.S. movie theaters.[78]\n\nIn Beck's hometown of Mt. Vernon, Washington, supporters and detractors hold handmade signs on the day Beck was honored by the mayor.\nThe finale of 2009's Common Sense Comedy Tour was simulcast in over 440 theaters.[79] The events have drawn 200,000 fans in recent years.[80]\nIn March 2003, Beck ran a series of rallies, which he called Glenn Beck's Rally for America, in support of troops deployed for the upcoming Iraq War. On July 4, 2007, he hosted the 2007 Toyota Tundra \"Stadium of Fire\" in Provo, Utah. America's Freedom Foundation presents the annual event at LaVell Edwards Stadium at Brigham Young University.[81] In May 2008, Beck gave the keynote speech at the NRA convention in Louisville, Kentucky.[82]\nIn late August 2009, the mayor of Beck's hometown, Mount Vernon, Washington, announced that he would award Beck the Key to the City, designating September 26, 2009, as \"Glenn Beck Day\". Due to local opposition, the city council voted unanimously to disassociate itself from the award.[83] The key presentation ceremony sold out the 850-seat McIntyre Hall and an estimated 800 detractors and supporters demonstrated outside the building. Earlier that day, approximately 7,000 people attended the Evergreen Freedom Foundation's \"Take the Field with Glenn Beck\" at Seattle's Safeco Field.[84]\nIn December 2009, Beck produced a one-night special film, The Christmas Sweater: A Return to Redemption.[85] In January and February 2010, he teamed with fellow Fox News host Bill O'Reilly to tour several cities in a live stage show called \"The Bold and Fresh Tour 2010\". The January 29 show was recorded and broadcast to movie theaters throughout the country.[86]\nIn July 2013, Beck produced and hosted a one-night stage event, Man in the Moon, held at the USANA Amphitheatre in West Valley City, Utah. The amphitheater sold out all 20,000 of its seats and a recording of the event was released on television and DVD in August 2013. The event was a narrative story told from the Moon's point of view, from the beginnings of the Book of Genesis to the first Moon landing. The Moon narrates the story.\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn 2011, Beck founded the nonprofit organization Mercury One, the mission of which is to \"restore the human spirit by encouraging dependence on God, providing humanitarian aid, preserving heritage, and empowering all to stand for truth.\"[87] In early 2011, he began work toward developing a clothing line to be sold to benefit the charity. In October 2011, Mercury One began selling the upscale clothing line 1791 exclusively at its website, 1791.com. The clothing in the line's 11-piece inaugural offering was manufactured by American Mojo of Lowell, Massachusetts.[88]\nIn July 2014, after tens of thousands of undocumented immigrant children crossed into Texas via the Southern United States border, unaccompanied by parents, Beck announced that he, Senator Mike Lee, and Representative Louie Gohmert would travel to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border with Mercury One. He said they would bring tractor trailers full of food, hot meals, and teddy bears for the unaccompanied minors. While Beck made clear in interviews that they wanted a full repeal of DACA, he also said he believed in the importance of helping these children. \"Through no fault of their own, they are caught in political crossfire, and while we continue to put pressure on Washington and change its course of lawlessness, we must also help\", Beck said. \"It is not either/or. It is both. We have to be active in the political game, and we must open our hearts.\"[89]\nAs of 2017, Beck's Nazarene Fund had reportedly relocated 10,524 Christian refugees from northern Iraq and Syria to other host countries, including the U.S., Australia, France, Slovakia, Greece, Lebanon, Brazil, and Canada. The fund's website says 1,646 families have been evacuated from the ISIS-ravaged region since its launch in 2014, and 45,000 people have received humanitarian aid as a result of donations to Mercury One.[90]\n\nProjects and rallies\n9\u201312 Project and Tea Party protests\nMain article: 9-12 Project\nIn March 2009, Beck put together a campaign, the 9-12 Project, named after nine principles and 12 values that he says embody the spirit of the American people on the day after the September 11 attacks.[91] The Colorado 9-12 Project hosted a \"Patriot Camp\" for kids in grades 1\u20135, featuring programs on \"our Constitution, the Founding Fathers, and the values and principles that are the cornerstones of our nation\".\n\nRestoring Honor rally\nMain article: Restoring Honor rally\nBeck promoted and hosted the Restoring Honor rally at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., on August 28, 2010. The rally\u2014which purported to embrace religious faith and patriotism\u2014was co-sponsored by the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, promoted by FreedomWorks, and supported by the Tea Party movement.[92] Attendance was estimated at 87,000 (\u00b1 9,000) based on aerial photos.[93]\n\n\"America's First Christmas\"\nIn December 2010, Beck went to Wilmington, Ohio, a town devastated by the late-2000s recession, to host live events to encourage his fans to go to the town to boost the local economy in a project called \"America's First Christmas\".[94] He hosted an event and his radio and television shows from the local theater.[95]\n\nRestoring Courage 2011 international tour\nMain article: Restoring Courage tour\nBeck headlined his \"Restoring Courage\" events in Jerusalem, Israel, in August 2011 in a campaign he said was designed to encourage people worldwide \"to stand with the Jewish people\".[96][97] After Jerusalem, Beck visited Cape Town, South Africa, and was scheduled to visit Venezuela.[98]\n\n2012 presidential campaign\nActively supporting Mitt Romney as \"perhaps the best-known Mormon after the Republican presidential candidate and a major influence on evangelical Christians, ... Beck has emerged as an unlikely theological bridge between the first Mormon presidential nominee and a critical electorate [evangelicals]\", according to a pre-election article in The New York Times. Along with personal campaign appearances in Ohio and Iowa, Beck directly addressed doctrinal issues between Mormons and evangelical Christians (the latter often consider the former a \"cult\" rather than Christian) on his radio show in September 2012. During the one-hour show, he asked his audience, \"Does Mitt Romney's Mormonism make him too scary or weird to be elected president of the United States?\" The article concluded by addressing the \"fear of making Mormonism mainstream\" as a reason Beck could be acceptable to evangelicals and Romney not be, quoting John C. Green, the author of The Faith Factor: How Religion Influences American Elections:\n\nThere's a difference between a public figure like Glenn Beck and someone who could be the president of the United States. ... Many evangelicals believe this country was founded by Christian leaders. It is important that the person in the White House be positive about Christianity, if not a devout Christian himself.[99]\nRestoring Love rally and \"Day of Service\"\nIn August 2012, Beck held a rally at AT&T Stadium in Irving, Texas. The event's theme was service to one's fellow citizens, and loving each other. The event saw a \"Day of Service\", which saw Mercury One volunteering to feed homeless and disadvantaged people, doing community-building projects, and mowing lawns. It culminated in a keynote speech by Beck imploring the audience to \"commit to each other. Go home and wake up your neighbors.\" Of serving fellow Americans, Beck said, \"Those who count us out are counting on one weekend of action, one weekend of speeches. One weekend. One day. Please, my fellow countrymen, let this be the first of many.\"[100][101]\n\nRestoring Unity and Never Again Is Now\nIn August 2015, Beck and Mercury Radio Arts organized a rally that saw a little over 20,000 people march through the streets of Birmingham, Alabama, in a statement of unity and support for persecuted Christians in Iraq, a cause Mercury One focuses on, and as a call for unity among the American people. After the march, the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex held a rally featuring speakers including Beck, Ted Cruz, Rafael Cruz, Jon Voight, Alveda King, and David Barton.\n\nPolitical views\nBeck has called himself a conservative with libertarian leanings.[102] Among his core values, he lists personal responsibility, private charity, the right to life, freedom of religion, limited government, and the family as the cornerstone of society.[103] Beck believes in low national debt, and has said, \"A conservative believes that debt creates unhealthy relationships. Everyone, from the government on down, should live within their means and strive for financial independence.\"[104] He supports individual gun ownership rights, opposes gun control legislation, and supports the NRA and its state chapters.[105]\nBeck rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[106] He contests the evidence, and has said, \"There is more proof for the resurrection of Jesus than man-made climate change.\"[106] He views the American Clean Energy and Security Act as a form of wealth redistribution, and he has promoted a petition rejecting the Kyoto Protocol.[107]\nAlthough opposed to illegal immigration, Beck announced in 2014 that Mercury One would make efforts to provide food and relief to the large numbers of migrant children.[108]\nOn March 18, 2015, Beck announced that he had left the Republican Party, saying that it had failed to effectively stand against Obamacare and immigration reform, and because of its opposition to lawmakers such as Mike Lee and Ted Cruz.[5]\nBeck endorsed Cruz for president of the United States in 2016.[109] In October 2016, Beck called opposing Donald Trump a \"moral, ethical choice\".[110] On the campaign trail in support of Cruz, Beck said, \"If Donald Trump wins, it is going to be a snowball to hell.\"[111] After Cruz dropped out of the race, Beck endorsed independent Evan McMullin.[112][113]\n\nOpposition to progressivism\n\n\nWhat's the difference between a communist or socialist and a progressive? Revolution or evolution? One requires a gun and the other eats away slowly.\n\n\n\u2013Glenn Beck, keynote address at the February 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference[114][115]\n\n\nDuring his 2010 keynote speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Beck wrote progressivism on a chalkboard and declared, \"This is the disease. This is the disease in America\", adding that \"progressivism is the cancer in America and it is eating our Constitution!\"[114][115] According to Beck, the progressive ideas of men such as John Dewey, Herbert Croly, and Walter Lippmann, influenced the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, eventually becoming the foundation for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.[114] Beck has said that such progressivism infects both main political parties and threatens to \"destroy America as it was originally conceived\".[114] In his book Common Sense, he argues that \"progressivism has less to do with the parties and more to do with individuals who seek to redefine, reshape, and rebuild America into a country where individual liberties and personal property mean nothing if they conflict with the plans and goals of the State.\"[114]\nA collection of progressives whom Beck has called \"Crime Inc.\" make up what he contends is a clandestine conspiracy to take over and transform the United States.[116][117][118] Some of these include Cass Sunstein, Van Jones, Andy Stern, John Podesta, Wade Rathke, Joel Rogers and Francis Fox Piven.[116][119] Other figures Beck has tied to \"Crime Inc.\" include Al Gore, Franklin Raines,[120] Maurice Strong, George Soros,[121] John Holdren and Barack Obama.[117] According to Beck, these people already have or are surreptitiously working to fulfill their agenda with an array of organizations and corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Fannie Mae, ACORN, Apollo Alliance, Tides Center, Chicago Climate Exchange, Generation Investment Management, Enterprise Community Partners, Petrobras, Center for American Progress, and the SEIU.[117][121] In his quest to root out these \"progressives\", Beck has compared himself to Israeli Nazi hunters, vowing on his radio show that \"to the day I die I am going to be a progressive-hunter. I'm going to find these people that have done this to our country and expose them. I don't care if they're in nursing homes.\"[30] Beck compared Al Gore to the Nazis while equating the campaign against global warming to the Nazi campaign against the Jews.[122]\nAccording to the book The Philosophy of Conspiracy Theories, Beck \"believes in the existence of a large-scale, long-term socialist conspiracy \u2013 encompassing elements of both the Democratic and Republican Parties \u2013 to deny American citizens their God-given rights to liberty and freedom from taxation.\"[123]\nProgressive historian Sean Wilentz has denounced what he calls Beck's progressive-themed conspiracy theories and \"gross historical inaccuracies\", contending that Beck is merely echoing the decades-old \"right-wing extremism\" of the John Birch Society.[124] According to Wilentz, Beck's \"version of history\" places him in a long line of figures who have challenged mainstream political historians and presented an inaccurate opposing view as the truth, stating:\n\nGlenn Beck is trying to give viewers a version of American history that is supposedly hidden. Supposedly, all we historians\u00a0\u2013  left, right and center\u00a0\u2013  have been doing for the past 100 years is to keep true American history from you. And that true American history is what Glenn Beck is teaching. It's a version of history that is beyond skewed. But of course, that's what Beck expects us to say. He lives in a kind of Alice in Wonderland world, where if people who actually know the history say what he's teaching is junk, he says, 'That's because you're trying to hide the truth.'[124]\nConservative David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, has also alleged Beck's propensity for negationism, remarking, \"Beck offers a story about the American past for people who are feeling right now very angry and alienated. It is different enough from the usual story in that he makes them feel like they've got access to secret knowledge.\"[30]\nIn 2020, Beck argued that the election of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders could lead to \"another Holocaust.\"[125]\n\nBarack Obama and the Obama administration\nBeck promoted numerous conspiracy theories and falsehoods about President Barack Obama and the Obama administration.[126][127][128][129] He suggested that Obama was building FEMA concentration camps to put opponents in,[130] that Obama was planning to fake a terrorist attack such as the Oklahoma City bombing to boost the administration's popularity,[131] and that Obama was George Soros's \"puppet\".[132] He often likened Obama and his administration to Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich.[130] Beck falsely claimed that the John Holdren, who led the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Obama administration, \"proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population.\"[133]\nIn 2009, Beck argued that Obama had repeatedly shown \"a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture\", saying, \"I'm not saying he doesn't like white people. I'm saying he has a problem. This guy is, I believe, a racist.\"[134] These remarks drew criticism and resulted in a boycott in which at least 57 advertisers requested that their ads be removed from his programming.[135][136][137][138] He later apologized for the remarks, telling Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace that he has a \"big fat mouth\" and miscast as racism what is actually, as he theorizes, Obama's belief in black theology.[139] In November 2012, Beck attempted to auction a mason jar holding an Obama figurine described as submerged in urine but in fact submerged in beer. Bidding reached $11,000 before eBay decided to remove the auction and cancel all bids.[140][141]\nIn a 2016 interview with The New Yorker, Beck said of his commentary on Obama: \"I did a lot of freaking out about Barack Obama.\" He added, \"Obama made me a better man.\" Beck said that he regrets calling Obama a racist and supports Black Lives Matter. He said, \"There are things unique to the African-American experience that I cannot relate to. I had to listen to them.\"[127]\n\nVan Jones\nIn July 2009, Beck began to focus many episodes on his TV and radio shows on Van Jones, special advisor for Green Jobs at Obama's White House Council on Environmental Quality. Beck called Jones a \"self-avowed, radical revolutionary communist\". PolitiFact rated Beck's claim \"mostly false\", noting that Jones, who has been open about his past as a communist during the early 1990s, had since expressed firmly capitalist beliefs.[142]\nBeck also criticized Jones for his involvement in STORM, a Bay Area radical group with Marxist roots,[143] and his support for death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal, who had been convicted of killing a police officer. Beck spotlighted a video of Jones calling Republicans \"assholes\", and a petition Jones signed suggesting that George W. Bush knowingly let the September 11 attacks happen. Time magazine credited Beck with leading conservatives' attack on Jones.[80]\nIn a move The New York Times called a White House response to the controversies, Jones said that \"the agenda of this president was bigger than any one individual\" and resigned his position in September 2009.[144] Jones called his opponents' attacks as a \"vicious smear campaign\" and an effort to use \"lies and distortions to distract and divide\".[143]\n\nCass Sunstein\nCass Sunstein, Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama White House, was a frequent target of Beck's conspiracy theories.[145][146] Beck led opposition against Sunstein's nomination to the position,[147] calling Sunstein \"the most dangerous man in America\"[148] and suggesting that Sunstein was plotting ways to \"ban\" conspiracy theorizing.[149]\n\nACORN\nIn 2009, Beck and other conservative commentators were critical of Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) making multiple claims including voter registration fraud in the 2008 presidential election.[150] In September 2009, he broadcast a series of alleged undercover videos by conservative activists James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles, which portrayed ACORN community organizers offering inappropriate tax and other advice to people who had said they wanted to import \"very young\" girls from El Salvador to work as child prostitutes.[151][152] Following the videos' release, the U.S. Census Bureau severed ties with the group while the U.S. House and Senate voted to cut all of its federal funding.[80]\nOn December 7, 2009, the former Massachusetts Attorney General, after an independent internal investigation of ACORN, found the videos that had been released appeared to have been edited, \"in some cases substantially\". He found no evidence of criminal conduct by ACORN employees, but concluded that ACORN had poor management practices that contributed to unprofessional actions by a number of its low-level employees.[153][154][155][156] On March 1, 2010, the District Attorney's office for Brooklyn determined that the videos were \"heavily edited\"[157] and concluded that there was no criminal wrongdoing by the ACORN staff in the videos from the Brooklyn ACORN office.[158][159] On April 1, 2010, an investigation by the California Attorney General found the videos from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino to be \"heavily edited\",[160] and the investigation did not find evidence of criminal conduct on the part of ACORN employees.[160][161] On June 14, 2010, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its findings, which showed that ACORN evidenced no sign that it, or any of its related organizations, mishandled any federal money they had received.[162][163] In March 2010, ACORN announced it would be closing its offices and disbanding due to loss of funding from government and private donors.[164]\nAccording to a 2010 study in the journal Perspectives on Politics, Beck played a prominent role in media attacks on ACORN.[165]\n\nSatire website\nIn 2009, lawyers for Beck brought a case (Beck v. Eiland-Hall) against the owner of a satirical website named GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The claim that the domain name of the website is itself defamatory was described as a first in cyberlaw.[166] Beck's lawyers argued that the site infringed on his trademarked name and that the domain name should be turned over to Beck.[167] The WIPO ruled against Beck, but Eiland-Hall voluntarily transferred the domain to Beck anyway, saying that the First Amendment had been upheld and that he no longer had a use for the domain name.[168]\n\nJewish Funds for Justice\nIn January 2011, in protest against what they saw as inappropriate references to the Holocaust and to Nazis by Beck (and by Roger Ailes of Fox News), four hundred rabbis signed an open letter published as a paid advertisement in The Wall Street Journal. The ad was paid for by Jewish Funds for Justice (JFFJ), which had previously called for Beck's firing. The JFFJ have claimed on their website that Beck seems \"to draw his material straight from the anti-Semitic forgery, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion\".[169] The letter states that Beck and Fox had \"diminish[ed] the memory and meaning of the Holocaust when you use it to discredit any individual or organization you disagree with. That is what Fox News has done in recent weeks.\" In response, a Fox News executive told Reuters the letter was from a \"George Soros-backed leftwing political organization\".[170][171]\n\nGeorge Soros conspiracy theories\nBeck is a prominent proponent of conspiracy theories about George Soros, a Jewish philanthropist.[172] Beck falsely claimed that Soros as a boy helped to \"send the Jews to the death camps.\"[172] Beck frequently referred to Soros as a puppet-master and repeated the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that Soros caused the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[172] In 2010, Beck was accused of being anti-Semitic due to his smears against Soros. The Anti-Defamation League said Beck's remarks about Soros sending Jews to the death camps were \"horrific\" and \"totally off-limits.\"[173]\nOn February 22, 2011, during a discussion on his radio show about the controversy surrounding his earlier comments about Soros, Beck said \"Reform Rabbis are generally political in nature. It's almost like radicalized Islam in a way where it's less about religion than it is about politics.\" He was quickly criticized by other conservatives, rabbis, and others. The Anti-Defamation League labeled Beck's remarks \"bigoted ignorance\". On February 24, Beck apologized on air, agreeing that his comments were \"ignorant\".[174][175]\nIn 2016, Beck, a friend of actor and director Mel Gibson claimed he and Gibson shared a conversation in which Gibson claimed Jewish people had stolen a copy of The Passion of the Christ before its official theatrical release, and that Jewish people were assaulting him in the streets.[176]\n\n2011 Norway attacks\nBeck condemned the 2011 Norway attacks,[177] but was condemned for his comparison of murdered and surviving members of the Norwegian Workers' Youth League to the Hitler Youth. He said, \"There was a shooting at a political camp which sounds a little like, you know, the Hitler Youth or whatever, you know what I mean. Who does a camp for kids that's all about politics? Disturbing.\"[178] The statement was ill-received in Norway, prompting political commentator and Labour party member Frank Aarebrot to label Beck as a \"vulgar propagandist\", a \"swine\" and a \"fascist\",[179] and Torbj\u00f8rn Eriksen, former press secretary to Norway's prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, to describe Beck's comment as \"a new low\", adding that \"Glenn Beck's comments are ignorant, incorrect and extremely hurtful\".[180] Commentators pointed out that groups affiliated with the Tea Party movement and the Beck-founded 9\u201312 Project also sponsor politically oriented camp programs for children.[179][180][181][182][183]\n\nTrump comments and 2016 SIRIUS XM Suspension\nBeck opposed Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign for president, comparing him to Adolf Hitler and describing him as \"an immoral man who is absent decency or dignity.\"[184][185]\nSirius XM suspended Beck on May 31, 2016, for remarks made during an interview a week earlier. During an interview with author Brad Thor about a hypothetical situation where Trump was abusing his power as president and Congress was unable to stop him, Thor asked \"what patriot will step up and [assassinate him] if, if, he oversteps his mandate as president?\"[186] Thor and the show's general manager both denied that the comments were a call for his assassination.[187] Beck's radio show was moved from the SIRIUS XM Patriot channel to the Triumph channel soon after.[188]\nBeck's opposition to Trump did not sit well with many Trump supporters and hurt his businesses and viewership.[189][190] On May 18, 2018, Beck stated on his radio program that he intended to vote for Trump in the 2020 presidential election, calling Trump's record \"pretty damn amazing\".[191] Beck said Trump's defeat in the 2020 election would be \"the end of the country as we know it.\"[184]\n\nInfluences\nPolitical and historical\n\n\nThe old American mind-set that Richard Hofstadter famously called the paranoid style\u2014the sense that Masons or the railroads or the Pope or the guys in black helicopters are in league to destroy the country\u2014is aflame again, fanned from both right and left ... No one has a better feeling for this mood, and no one exploits it as well, as Beck. He is the hottest thing in the political-rant racket, left or right.\n\n\n\u2013David Von Drehle, Time, 2009[80]\n\n\nAn author with ideological influence on Beck is W. Cleon Skousen (1913\u20132006), a prolific conservative political writer, American constitutionalist and faith based political theorist.[192][193] As an anti-communist supporter of the John Birch Society,[194] and a limited-government activist,[195] Skousen, who was Mormon, wrote on a wide range of subjects: the Six-Day War, Mormon eschatology, New World Order conspiracies, even parenting.[195] Skousen believed that American political, social, and economic elites were working with communists to foist a world government on the United States.[114] Beck praised Skousen's \"words of wisdom\" as \"divinely inspired\", referencing Skousen's The Naked Communist[196] and especially The 5,000 Year Leap (originally published in 1981),[195] which Beck said in 2007 had \"changed his life\".[195] According to Skousen's nephew, Mark Skousen, Leap reflects Skousen's \"passion for the United States Constitution\", which he \"felt was inspired by God and the reason behind America's success as a nation\".[197] The book is recommended by Beck as \"required reading\" to understand the current American political landscape and become a \"September twelfth person\".[195] Beck authored a foreword for the 2008 edition of Leap and Beck's on-air recommendations in 2009 propelled the book to number one in the government category on Amazon for several months.[195] In 2010, Matthew Continetti of the conservative Weekly Standard criticized Beck's conspiratorial bent, terming him \"a Skousenite\".[114] Additionally, Alexander Zaitchik, author of the 2010 book Common Nonsense: Glenn Beck and the Triumph of Ignorance, which features an entire chapter on \"The Ghost of Cleon Skousen\",[198] refers to Skousen as \"Beck's favorite author and biggest influence\", while observing he authored four of the 10 books on Beck's 9-12 Project required-reading list.[199]\nIn his discussion of Beck and Skousen, Continetti said that one of Skousen's works \"draws on Carroll Quigley's Tragedy and Hope (1966), which argues that the history of the 20th century is the product of secret societies in conflict\".[114] He observed in Beck's novel, The Overton Window (which Beck describes as \"faction\", or fiction based on fact), a character says: \"Carroll Quigley laid open the plan in Tragedy and Hope, the only hope to avoid the tragedy of war was to bind together the economies of the world to foster global stability and peace.\"[114]\nBeck's views on early-20th-century progressivism are greatly influenced by Ronald J. Pestritto, who teaches at Hillsdale College.[200] The portal page GlennBeck.com for \"American Progressivism\"[201] uses Pestritto's teachings and links directly to one of his books. Pestritto wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal detailing \"Glenn Beck, Progressives and Me\".[202] The New York Times observed that Pestritto was a regular guest on Beck's Fox News show, .[203][204][205]\nPrinceton University historian Sean Wilentz says that alongside Skousen, John Birch Society founder Robert W. Welch, Jr., is a key ideological foundation of Beck's worldview.[206] According to Wilentz, Beck \"has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of.\"[206]\nOther books that Beck regularly cites on his programs are Amity Shlaes's The Forgotten Man, Jonah Goldberg's Liberal Fascism, Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen's A Patriot's History of the United States, and Burton W. Folsom, Jr.'s New Deal or Raw Deal.[114] Beck has also urged his listeners to read The Coming Insurrection, a book by a French Marxist group[114] discussing what they see as the imminent collapse of capitalist culture.[207]\nOn June 4, 2010, Beck endorsed Elizabeth Dilling's 1936 work The Red Network: A Who's Who and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots, remarking, \"this is a book, The Red Network, this came in from 1936. People, [Joseph] McCarthy was absolutely right ... This is, who were the communists in America.\"[208] Beck was criticized by an array of people, including Menachem Z. Rosensaft and Joe Conason, who said that Dilling was an outspoken anti-Semite and a Nazi sympathizer.[209][210][211]\n\nReligious\nBeck during his religiously themed speech at the Restoring Honor rally on August 28, 2010\nBeck has credited God for saving him from drug and alcohol abuse, professional obscurity, and friendlessness.[212] In 2006, he performed an inspirational monologue in Salt Lake City, Utah,[24] detailing how he was transformed by the \"healing power of Jesus Christ\", which was released as a CD two years later by Deseret Book, a publishing company owned by the LDS Church, entitled An Unlikely Mormon: The Conversion Story of Glenn Beck.[213]\nWriter Joanna Brooks contends that Beck developed his \"amalgamation of anti-communism\" and \"connect-the-dots conspiracy theorizing\" only after his entry into the \"deeply insular world of Mormon thought and culture\".[192] Brooks theorizes that Beck's calls to fasting and prayer are rooted in Mormon collective fasts to address spiritual challenges, while his \"overt sentimentality\" and penchant for weeping represent the hallmark of a \"distinctly Mormon mode of masculinity\" where \"appropriately-timed displays of tender emotion are displays of power\" and spirituality.[192] Philip Barlow, the Arrington chair of Mormon history and culture at Utah State University, has said that Beck's belief that the U.S. Constitution was an \"inspired document\" and his calls for limited government and not exiling God from the public sphere \"have considerable sympathy in Mormonism\".[214] Beck has acknowledged that Mormon \"doctrine is different\" from traditional Christianity, but said that this was what attracted him to it: \"for me some of the things in traditional doctrine just doesn't work.\"[215]\n\nPublic reception\n\n\nTo his admirers, Glenn Beck has been a voice crying in the wilderness, a prophet who warns us that we have been wandering in darkness too long. To detractors, he is a clown and a buffoon, at best, a dangerous demagogue, at worst.\n\n\n\u2013Lee Harris, The Weekly Standard, 2010[216]\n\n\nIn 2009, Beck's show was one of the highest rated news commentary programs on cable TV.[217][218][219][220] For a Barbara Walters ABC special, Beck was selected as one of America's \"Top 10 Most Fascinating People\" of 2009.[221] In 2010, he was selected for Time's top 100 most influential people under the \"Leaders\" category.[222]\nBeck has called himself an entertainer,[223] a commentator rather than a reporter,[224] and a \"rodeo clown\".[223] He has said that he identifies with Howard Beale, a character portrayed by Peter Finch in the film Network: \"When he came out of the rain and he was like, 'none of this makes any sense'\u2014I am that guy.\"[225]\n\nBeck at CPAC 2011\nAccording to Tampa Bay Times, Beck's supporters have praised him as a constitutional stalwart defending their traditional American values.[226]\nTime magazine described Beck as \"the new populist superstar of Fox News\", saying it is easier to see a set of attitudes rather than a specific ideology, noting his criticism of Wall Street, yet defending bonuses to AIG, as well as denouncing conspiracy theories about the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) but warning against indoctrination of children by the AmeriCorps program.\"[227] (Paul Krugman[228] and Mark Potok,[229] on the other hand, have been among those asserting that Beck helps spread \"hate\" by covering issues that stir up extremists.) What seems to unite Beck's disparate themes, Time argued, is a sense of siege.[227] An earlier Time cover story called Beck \"a gifted storyteller with a knack for stitching seemingly unrelated data points into possible conspiracies\", proclaiming that he has \"emerged as a virtuoso on the strings\" of conservative discontent by mining \"the timeless theme of the corrupt Them thwarting a virtuous Us\".[80]\nBeck's shows have been called a \"mix of moral lessons, outrage and an apocalyptic view of the future ... capturing the feelings of an alienated class of Americans\".[223] One of Beck's Fox News Channel colleagues, Shepard Smith, has jokingly called Beck's studio the \"fear chamber\", with Beck countering that he preferred the term \"doom room\".[80]\nRepublican South Carolina U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham criticized Beck as a \"cynic\" whose show was antithetical to \"American values\" at The Atlantic's 2009 First Draft of History conference, remarking, \"Only in America can you make that much money crying.\"[230] The progressive watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting's (FAIR) Activism Director, Peter Hart, argues that Beck red-baits political adversaries and promotes a paranoid view of progressive politics.[231] Howard Kurtz, of The Washington Post, has remarked, \"Love him or hate him, Beck is a talented, often funny broadcaster, a recovering alcoholic with an unabashedly emotional style.\"[57]\nLaura Miller writes in Salon that Beck is a contemporary example of \"the paranoid style in American politics\" described by historian Richard Hofstader:\n\nThe Paranoid Style in American Politics reads like a playbook for the career of Glenn Beck, right down to the paranoid's \"quality of pedantry\" and \"heroic strivings for 'evidence'\", embodied in Beck's chalkboard and piles of books. But Beck lacks an archenemy commensurate with his stratospheric ambitions, which makes him appear even more absurd to outsiders.[232]\nBeck has acknowledged accusations of being a conspiracy theorist, saying on his show that there is a \"concentrated effort now to label me a conspiracy theorist\".[233][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nParticularly as a consequence of Beck's Restoring Honor rally in 2010, the fact that Beck is Mormon caused concern among some politically sympathetic Christian Evangelicals on theological grounds.[234][235][236][237] Tom Tradup, vice president at Salem Radio Network, which serves more than 2,000 Christian-themed stations, expressed this sentiment after the rally, saying, \"Politically, everyone is with it, but theologically, when he says the country should turn back to God, the question is: Which God?\"[212] A September 2010 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) and Religion News Service (RNS) found that of those Americans who hold a favorable opinion of Beck, only 45% believe he is the right person to lead a religious movement, with that number further declining to 37% when people are informed he is Mormon.[238][239] Daniel Cox, director of research for PRRI, summed up this position by stating:\n\nThe disparity between Glenn Beck's favorability ratings and how people feel about him as a religious leader suggests that people are more drawn to him for political reasons than religious ones. Many of Beck's strongest supporters, such as Republicans and white Evangelicals, perceive real differences between their own faith and Beck's Mormon faith, and this may become a liability in his efforts to lead as a religious figure.[238]\nPete Peterson of Pepperdine's Davenport Institute said that Beck's speech at the rally belonged to an American tradition of calls to personal renewal. Peterson wrote: \"A Mormon surrounded onstage by priests, pastors, rabbis, and imams, Beck [gave] one of the more ecumenical jeremiads in history.\"[240] Evangelical pastor Tony Campolo said in 2010 that conservative evangelicals respond to Beck's framing of conservative economic principles, saying that Beck's and ideological fellow travelers' \"marriage between evangelicalism and patriotic nationalism is so strong that anybody who is raising questions about loyalty to the old, lassez-faire capitalist system is ex-post facto unpatriotic, un-American, and by association non-Christian.\" Newsweek religion reporter Lisa Miller, after quoting Campolo, opined, \"It's ironic that Beck, a Mormon, would gain acceptance as a leader of a new Christian coalition. ... Beck's gift ... is to articulate God's special plan for America in such broad strokes that they trample no single creed or doctrine while they move millions with their message.\"[241]\n\nCritical biographies\nIn June 2010, investigative reporter Alexander Zaitchik released a critical biography, Common Nonsense: Glenn Beck and the Triumph of Ignorance, with a title mocking Beck's work, Common Sense.[242] In an interview about the book, Zaitchik theorized, \"Beck's politics and his insatiable hunger for money and fame are not mutually exclusive\", adding:\n\nBeck's true religion is not Patriotism, Mormonism, or Conservatism. His true religion is cross-platform self-marketing ... According to Beck's worldview, there's no inherent contradiction between his sophisticated instinct for self-promotion, his propagandist rodeo clown act, his self-image as a media mogul, and his professed belief system. I think he actually believes that God wants him to make a ton of money and become this huge celebrity by fear mongering and generally doing whatever it takes in the media to promote right-wing causes.[243]\nIn September 2010, Philadelphia Daily News reporter Will Bunch released The Backlash: Right-Wing Radicals, High-Def Hucksters, and Paranoid Politics in the Age of Obama.[244] One of Bunch's theses is that Beck is nothing more than a morning zoo deejay playing a fictional character as a money-making stunt.[244] Writer Bob Cesca, in a review of Bunch's book, compares Beck to Steve Martin's faith-healer character in the 1992 film Leap of Faith, before describing the \"derivative grab bag of other tried and tested personalities\" that Bunch contends comprises Beck's persona:\n\nHis [Beck's] adenoidal \"Clydie Clyde\" voice is based on morning zoo pioneer Scott Shannon's \"Mr. Leonard\" character. His history is borrowed from the widely debunked work of W. Cleon Skousen. His conspiracy theories are horked from Alex Jones and maybe Jack Van Impe. His anti-Obama, anti-socialist monologues are pure Joe McCarthy. His chalkboard is stolen from televangelist Gene Scott. His solemn, over-processed radio monologue delivery is a dead ringer for Eric Bogosian in Talk Radio. This is all well-worn stuff, but no one has drawn it all together and sculpted it for the purpose of conning an especially susceptible audience during turbulent racial and economic times.[244]\nIn October 2010 a polemical biography by Dana Milbank was released: Tears of a Clown: Glenn Beck and the Tea Bagging of America.[245]\n\nSatire, spoof and parody\nBeck has been the subject of mockery and ridicule by a number of humorists. In response to his animated delivery and views, he was parodied in an impersonation by Jason Sudeikis on Saturday Night Live.[246] The Daily Show's Jon Stewart has spoofed Beck's 9\u201312 project with his own \"11-3 project\", consisting of \"11 principles and 3 herbs and spices\",[247] impersonated Beck's chalk board-related presentation style for an entire show,[248] and quipped about Beck: \"finally, a guy who says what people who aren't thinking are thinking\".[249] Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report satirized Beck's \"war room\" by creating his own \"doom bunker\".[250] Through the character Eric Cartman, South Park parodied Beck's television program and his commentary style in the episode \"Dances with Smurfs\".[251] The Onion, a satirical periodical and faux news site, ran an Onion News Network video \"special report\" lamenting that the \"victim in a fatal car accident was tragically not Glenn Beck\".[252] Meanwhile, the Current TV cartoon SuperNews! ran an animated cartoon feature titled \"The Glenn Beck Apocalypse\", where Beck is confronted by Jesus Christ, who rebukes him as the equivalent of \"Sarah Palin farting into a balloon\".[253] Political comedian and satirist Bill Maher has mocked Beck's followers as an \"army of diabetic mallwalkers\",[254] while The Buffalo Beast named Beck the most loathsome person in America in 2010, declaring, \"It's like someone found a manic, doom-prophesying hobo in a sandwich board, shaved him, shot him full of Zoloft and gave him a show.\"[30] The October 30, 2010, Rally To Restore Sanity and/or Fear in Washington, hosted by Comedy Central personalities Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, was conceived as a parody of Beck's earlier Rally to Restore Honor,[255] even though Stewart and Colbert said that they came up with the idea of holding a rally in March[256] and Stewart had put down the deposit for the National Mall before Beck announced his rally.[257]\n\nDefamation lawsuit and settlement\nIn March 2014, Abdulrahman Alharbi filed suit for defamation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Beck and his business entities, The Blaze and Mercury Radio Arts, along with his distributor Premiere Radio Networks. Alharbi's defamation claim arose from Beck's repeated broadcasts \"identifying Alharbi as an active participant\" in the Boston Marathon bombing, even after federal authorities cleared Alharbi, who was injured in the attack, of any wrongdoing and confirmed that he was an innocent victim.[258][259] In December 2014, the judge rejected Beck's attempt to have the case dismissed.[260] In September 2016, the suit was settled on confidential terms.[259]\n\nSee also\nBeck University\nConservative talk radio\nList of most-listened-to radio programs\nWorks\nNon-fiction\nThe Real America: Messages from the Heart and Heartland.

He began blogging on national security issues in October 2005, when he was becoming increasingly concerned with what he viewed as attacks on civil liberties by the George W. Bush administration in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.[5][6] He became a vocal critic of the Iraq War and has maintained a critical position of American foreign policy.\nGreenwald started contributing to Salon in 2007, and to The Guardian in 2012. In June 2013, while at The Guardian, he began publishing a series of reports detailing previously unknown information about American and British global surveillance programs based on classified documents provided by Edward Snowden. His work contributed to The Guardian's 2014 Pulitzer Prize win and he was among a group of three reporters who won the 2013 George Polk Award. In 2014, he cofounded The Intercept, of which he was an editor until he resigned in October 2020. Greenwald subsequently started self-publishing on Substack.[7]\nThrough The Intercept Brasil in June 2019, Greenwald published leaked conversations between senior officials involved in Operation Car Wash, a corruption case in Brazil. The conversations appeared to show the investigative judge acting prejudicially towards Lula in the lead up to the 2018 elections. Greenwald was charged with cybercrimes by Brazilian prosecutors over the leaks in January 2020,[8] though the charges were dismissed by a federal judge a month later.[9]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nGreenwald was born in Queens in New York City to Arlene and Daniel Greenwald.[10] Greenwald's family moved to Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, when he was an infant;[11][12][13] his parents separated when he was six.[14] His parents, who are Jewish, and his grandparents did try to introduce him to Judaism, but he grew up without practicing an organized religion, did not have a bar mitzvah, and has said his \"moral precepts aren't informed in any way by religious doctrine\".[15] Greenwald attended Nova Middle School and Nova High School in Davie, Florida.[16]\nInspired by his grandfather's time on the then-Lauderdale Lakes City Council, Greenwald, still in high school, decided to run at the age of 17 for an at-large seat on the council in the 1985 elections.[17] He was unsuccessful, coming in fourth place with 7% of the total vote.[18] In 1991, Greenwald ran again, coming in third place with 18% of the vote.[18][19] After that, he stopped running for political office and instead focused on law school.[13]\nHe received a B.A. in philosophy from George Washington University in 1990 and a J.D. from New York University School of Law in 1994.[11][13] His experiences on his college debate team influenced his career path.[20] \"That developed, I think, a lot of the skills and interest that ended up guiding my future career,\" he said in an interview.\n\nLitigation attorney[edit]\nGreenwald practiced law in the litigation department at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz from 1994 to 1995. In 1996, he co-founded his own litigation firm, Greenwald Christoph & Holland (later renamed Greenwald Christoph PC), where he litigated cases concerning issues of U.S. constitutional law and civil rights.[11][12] He worked pro bono much of the time, and his cases included representing white supremacist Matthew Hale in Illinois, who, Greenwald believed, was wrongly imprisoned,[21] and the neo-nazi National Alliance.[22]\nAbout his work in First Amendment speech cases, Greenwald told Rolling Stone magazine in 2013, \"to me, it's a heroic attribute to be so committed to a principle that you apply it not when it's easy ... not when it supports your position, not when it protects people you like, but when it defends and protects people that you hate\".[23]\nLater, according to Greenwald, \"I decided voluntarily to wind down my practice in 2005 because I could, and because, after ten years, I was bored with litigating full-time and wanted to do other things which I thought were more engaging and could make more of an impact, including political writing.\"[12]\n\nJournalism[edit]\nUnclaimed Territory and Salon[edit]\nIn October 2005, he began his blog Unclaimed Territory focusing on the investigation pertaining to the Plame affair, the CIA leak grand jury investigation, the federal indictment of Scooter Libby and the NSA warrantless surveillance (2001\u201307) controversy. In April 2006, the blog received the 2005 Koufax Award for \"Best New Blog\".[11] According to Sean Wilentz in the New Statesman, Greenwald \"seemed to take pride in attacking Republicans and Democrats alike\".[22]\nIn February 2007, Greenwald became a contributing writer for the Salon website, and the new column and blog superseded Unclaimed Territory, although Salon featured hyperlinks to it in Greenwald's dedicated biographical section.[24][25]\n\nGreenwald, Noam Chomsky and Amy Goodman in April 2011\nAmong the frequent topics of his Salon articles were the investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks and the candidacy of former CIA official John O. Brennan for the jobs of either Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (D/CIA) or the next Director of National Intelligence (DNI) after the election of Barack Obama. Brennan withdrew his name from consideration for the post after opposition centered in liberal blogs and led by Greenwald.[26][27][28][29][30][31]\nIn a 2010 article for Salon, Greenwald described U.S. Army Private Chelsea Manning as \"a whistle-blower acting with the noblest of motives\" and \"a national hero similar to Daniel Ellsberg\".[32] In an article for The Raw Story published in 2011, Greenwald criticized the prison conditions in which Manning was held after her arrest by military authorities.[33]\nGreenwald was described by Rachel Maddow during his period writing for Salon as \"the American left\u2019s most fearless political commentator.\"[22]\n\nThe Guardian[edit]\nIn July 2012, Greenwald joined the American wing of Britain's Guardian newspaper, to contribute a weekly column and a daily blog.[34][35] Greenwald wrote on Salon that the move offered him \"the opportunity to reach a new audience, to further internationalize my readership, and to be re-invigorated by a different environment\" as reasons for the move.[34][36]\n\nGlobal surveillance disclosure[edit]\nMain article: 2013 Global surveillance disclosure\nSnowden, Poitras, and Greenwald were the recipients of the 2014 Carl von Ossietzky medal.\nGreenwald was initially contacted anonymously in late 2012 by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the U.S. National Security Agency,[37] who said he held \"sensitive documents\" that he wished to share.[38] Greenwald found the measures that Snowden asked him to take to secure their communications too annoying to employ.[37] Snowden then contacted documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras about a month later in January 2013.[39]\nAccording to The Guardian, Snowden was attracted to Greenwald and Poitras by a Salon article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras' films had made her a \"target of the government\".[38][40] Greenwald began working with Snowden in either February[41] or in April, after Poitras asked Greenwald to meet her in New York City, at which point Snowden began providing documents to them both.[37]\nAs part of the global surveillance disclosure, the first of Snowden's documents were published on June 5, 2013, in The Guardian in an article by Greenwald reporting on the top-secret United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order requiring Verizon to provide the National Security Agency with telephone metadata for all calls between the U.S. and abroad, as well as all domestic calls.[42][43][44] Greenwald said that Snowden's documents exposed the \"scale of domestic surveillance under Obama\".[45] In September 2021, Yahoo! News reported that in 2017, after the publication of the Vault 7 files, \"top intelligence officials lobbied the White House\" to designate Glenn Greenwald as an \"information broker\" to allow for more investigative tools against him, \"potentially paving the way\" for his prosecution. However, the White House rejected this idea. \"I am not the least bit surprised,\" Greenwald told Yahoo! News, \"that the CIA, a longtime authoritarian and antidemocratic institution, plotted to find a way to criminalize journalism and spy on and commit other acts of aggression against journalists.\"[46]\nThe series on which Greenwald worked contributed to The Guardian (alongside The Washington Post) winning the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 2014.[47][48]\nGreenwald's work on the Snowden story was featured in the documentary Citizenfour, which won the 2014 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Greenwald appeared on stage with director Laura Poitras and Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, to accept the award.[49] In the 2016 feature film Snowden, directed by Oliver Stone, Greenwald was played by actor Zachary Quinto.[50]\n\nTestimony[edit]\nIn a statement delivered before the National Congress of Brazil in early August 2013, Greenwald testified that the U.S. government had used counter-terrorism as a pretext for clandestine surveillance to compete with other countries in the \"business, industrial and economic fields\".[51][52]\nOn December 18, 2013, Greenwald told the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs of the European Parliament that \"most governments around the world are not only turning their backs on Edward Snowden but also on their ethical responsibilities\".[53] Speaking via a video link, Greenwald said that, \"It is the UK through their interception of underwater fibre optic cables, that is a primary threat to the privacy of European citizens when it comes to their telephone and emails\". In a statement given to the European Parliament, Greenwald said:\n\nThe ultimate goal of the NSA, along with its most loyal, one might say subservient junior partner the British agency GCHQ \u2013 when it comes to the reason why the system of suspicion of surveillance is being built and the objective of this system \u2013 is nothing less than the elimination of individual privacy worldwide\u2014\u200aGlenn Greenwald[54]\nOn October 15, 2013, Greenwald left The Guardian, to pursue a \"once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity that no journalist could possibly decline\".[55][56]\n\nFirst Look Media and The Intercept[edit]\nFinancial backing for The Intercept was provided by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.[57][58] Omidyar told media critic Jay Rosen that the decision was fueled by his \"rising concern about press freedoms in the United States and around the world\". Greenwald, along with his colleagues Laura Poitras and Jeremy Scahill, initially were working on creating a platform online to support independent journalism, when they were approached by Omidyar, who was hoping to establish his own media organization. That news organization, First Look Media, launched its first online publication, The Intercept, on February 10, 2014.[59] Greenwald initially served as editor, alongside Poitras and Scahill. The organization is incorporated as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charitable entity.[60][61]\nThe Intercept was in contact during the 2016 presidential campaign with Guccifer 2.0, who relayed some of the material about Hillary Clinton, gathered via a data breach, to Greenwald. The Grugq, a counterintelligence specialist, reported in October 2016: \"The Intercept was both aware that the e-mails were from Guccifer 2.0, that Guccifer 2.0 has been attributed to Russian intelligence services, and that there is significant public evidence supporting this attribution.\"[62]\nBy 2019, he was serving as an Intercept columnist without any control over the site's news reporting.[63] On October 29, 2020, Greenwald resigned from The Intercept, giving his reasons as political censorship and contractual breaches by the editors, who he said had prevented him from reporting on allegations concerning Joe Biden's conduct with regard to China and Ukraine and had demanded that he not publish the article in any other publication.[64] Betsy Reed, the editor-in-chief, disputed Greenwald's accusations and claims of censorship, and accused him of presenting dubious claims by the Trump campaign as journalism.[64][65][66] Greenwald said he would begin publishing his work on Substack, and had begun \"exploring the possibility of creating a new media outlet.\"[67][68] After resigning from The Intercept, Greenwald published his article about Biden and his correspondence with the editors of The Intercept on his Substack page.[64]\n\nSubstack, Locals, and Rumble[edit]\nAfter his resignation from The Intercept, Greenwald began publishing reporting and commentary on Substack, an online, subscriber-based newsletter platform, where (as of June 2023), he amassed over 295,000 subscribers.[69] In 2023, Greenwald announced that he would begin hosting System Update, a nightly, one-hour live program on Rumble, an alternative to video-hosting platform YouTube.[70] System Update consists of a monologue concerning topical political issues, often related to media criticism and developments within the American security state, as well as interviews with guests. Such guests have included academics, political figures, and journalists Jeffrey Sachs, John Mearsheimer, Edward Snowden, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Lee Fang, and Matt Taibbi, among others. After moving to Rumble, Greenwald republished his Substack work to Locals, Rumble's Substack alternative.\n\nAppearances on conservative media[edit]\nAccording to Simon van Zuylen-Wood writing for New York magazine in early 2018, Greenwald has \"repositioned himself as a bomb-throwing media critic\" since the Snowden revelations.[71] Greenwald has become a frequent guest on Fox News,[72][73] particularly on Tucker Carlson Tonight.[74][73] He claims that MSNBC has banned him from appearing on the network because of his criticisms of Rachel Maddow.[75]\n\n2019 Operation Car Wash Telegram chat leaks in Brazil[edit]\nMain articles: Vaza Jato and List of scandals in Brazil\nVaza Jato\nScandal\nVaza Jato\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\nS\u00e9rgio Moro\nDeltan Dallagnol\nGlenn Greenwald\nRodrigo Janot\nAlberto Youssef\nEike Batista\nMarcelo Odebrecht\n\nCompanies\nPetrobras\nOdebrecht\n\nNews media\nThe Intercept\nVeja\nFolha de S.Paulo\nLe Figaro\nEl Pa\u00eds\nThe Washington Post\n\nJudges\nGilmar Ferreira Mendes\nEnrique Ricardo Lewandowski\nK\u00e1ssio Nunes Marques\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Dias Toffoli\nLuiz Fux\nC\u00e1rmen L\u00facia Antunes Rocha\nLuiz Edson Fachin\nvte\nOn June 9, 2019, Greenwald and journalists from investigative journalism magazine The Intercept Brasil where he was an editor, released several messages exchanged via Telegram between members of the investigation team of Operation Car Wash \u2013 called Car Leaks. The messages implicated members of Brazil's judiciary system and of the Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava-Jato taskforce, including former judge and Minister of Justice S\u00e9rgio Moro, and lead prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol, in the violation of legal and ethical procedures during the investigation, trial and arrest of former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, with the alleged objective of preventing him from running for a third term in the 2018 Brazilian general election, among other crimes. The FBI was also involved. Following the leak, Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo and Veja confirmed the authenticity of the messages and worked in partnership with The Intercept Brasil to sort the remaining material in their possession before releasing it.[76]\nOn July 23, Brazilian Federal Police announced that they had arrested and were investigating Araraquara hacker Walter Delgatti Neto for breaking into the authorities' Telegram accounts. Neto confessed to the hack and to having given copies of the chat logs to Greenwald. Police said the attack had been accomplished by abusing Telegram's phone number verification and exploiting vulnerabilities in voicemail technology in use in Brazil by using a spoofed phone number. The Intercept neither confirmed nor denied Neto being their source, citing freedom of the press provisions of the 1988 Brazilian Constitution.[77]\nGreenwald faced death threats and homophobic harassment from Bolsonaro supporters due to his reporting on the Telegram messages.[78] A New York Times profile by Ernesto Londo\u00f1o about Greenwald and his husband David Miranda, a left-wing congressman, described how the couple became targets of homophobia from Bolsonaro supporters as a result of the reporting.[79][80] The Washington Post reported that Greenwald had been targeted with fiscal investigations by the Bolsonaro government, allegedly as retaliation for the reporting,[81] and AP called Greenwald's reporting \"the first test case for a free press\" under Bolsonaro.[82]\nIn reporting on retaliation against Greenwald from the Bolsonaro government and its supporters, The Guardian said the articles published by Greenwald and The Intercept \"have had an explosive impact on Brazilian politics and dominated headlines for weeks\", adding that the expos\u00e9s \"appeared to show prosecutors in the sweeping Operation Car Wash corruption inquiry colluding with S\u00e9rgio Moro, the judge who became a hero in Brazil for jailing powerful businessmen, middlemen and politicians.\"[83]\nOn August 9, after President Bolsonaro threatened to imprison Greenwald for this reporting,[84] Supreme Court justice Gilmar Mendes ruled that any investigation of Greenwald in connection with the reporting would be illegal under the Brazilian constitution, citing press freedom as a \"pillar of democracy\".[85]\nIn November 2019, Brazilian journalist Augusto Nunes physically attacked Greenwald during a joint appearance on a Brazilian radio program. Immediately prior to the attack, Nunes had argued that a family judge ought to take away Greenwald's adopted children, prompting Greenwald to call him a coward. Two of Jair Bolsonaro's sons praised Nunes' actions, while former presidential candidate Ciro Gomes defended Greenwald.[86]\nIn January 2020, Greenwald was charged by Brazilian prosecutors with cybercrimes,[8] in a move that Trevor Timm in The Guardian described as retaliation for his reporting.[87] The Canary website described the charges as \"ominously similar to the indictment of Julian Assange\" and quoted Max Blumenthal and Jen Robinson as remarking on the similarity of the two sets of charges.[88] Greenwald received support from The New York Times which published an editorial stating \"Mr. Greenwald's articles did what a free press is supposed to do: They revealed a painful truth about those in power\". The Freedom of the Press Foundation made a statement asking the Brazilian government to \"halt its persecution of Greenwald\".[89] In February 2020, a federal judge dismissed the charges against Greenwald, citing a ruling from Supreme Court justice Gilmar Mendes that shielded him.[9]\n\nBooks[edit]\nGreenwald's first book, How Would a Patriot Act? Defending American Values From a President Run Amok, was published by Working Assets in 2006. It was a New York Times bestseller,[90] and ranked No. 1 on Amazon.com, both before its publication (due to orders based on attention from 'UT' readers and other bloggers) and for several days after its release, ending its first week at No. 293.[91]\nA Tragic Legacy, his second book, examined the presidency of George W. Bush. Published in hardback by Crown (a division of Random House) on June 26, 2007, and reprinted in a paperback edition by Three Rivers Press on April 8, 2008, it was also a New York Times bestseller. Great American Hypocrites: Toppling the Big Myths of Republican Politics was also first published by Random House in April 2008.[92][93] Metropolitan Books released his fourth and fifth books, With Liberty and Justice for Some: How the Law Is Used to Destroy Equality and Protect the Powerful and No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State, in October 2011 and May 2014, respectively.[94] The latter work spent six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list,[95] and was named one of the ten Best Non-Fiction Books of 2014 by The Christian Science Monitor.[96]\nGreenwald wrote the book Securing Democracy: My Fight for Press Freedom and Justice in Brazil as a follow-up to No Place to Hide. It was published by Haymarket Books in April 2021. It describes his publication in 2019 of leaked telephone calls, audio and text messages related to Operation Car Wash and the retaliation he received from Jair Bolsonaro's government.[97][98]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nUnited States[edit]\nGeorge W. Bush and Barack Obama eras[edit]\nDavid Miranda and Greenwald speak at the National Congress of Brazil in the wake of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures.\nIn his 2006 book How Would a Patriot Act?, Greenwald wrote that he was politically apathetic at the time of the Iraq War and accepted the George W. Bush administration's judgement that \"American security really would be enhanced by the invasion of this sovereign country.\" Greenwald is critical of actions jointly supported by Democrats and Republicans, writing in 2010: \"The worst and most tyrannical government actions in Washington are equally supported on a fully bipartisan basis.\"[99] In How Would a Patriot Act?, Greenwald described his 'pre-political' self as neither liberal nor conservative as a whole, voting neither for George W. Bush nor for any of his rivals (indeed, not voting at all).[100]\nHe criticized the policies of the Bush administration and those who supported it, arguing that most of the American \"corporate news media\" excused Bush's policies and echoed the administration's positions rather than asking hard questions.[101][102] Greenwald accused mainstream U.S. media of \"spreading patriotic state propaganda\".[103]\n\nDonald Trump and Russian election interference[edit]\nGreenwald has criticized some of the policies of the Trump administration, saying, \"I think the Trump White House lies more often. I think it lies more readily. I think it lies more blatantly.\"[104]\nDuring the Trump administration Greenwald was a critic of the Democratic Party, alleging a double standard in their foreign policy: \"Democrats didn't care when Obama hugged Saudi despots, and now they pretend to care when Trump embraces Saudi despots or Egyptian ones.\"[104]\nGreenwald expressed skepticism of the James Clapper-led US intelligence community's assessment that Russia's government interfered in the 2016 presidential election.[71][104] Regardless of the accuracy of the assessment, he doubted its significance,[71] stating \"This is stuff we do to them, and have done to them for decades, and still continue to do.\"[104]\nSusan Hennessey, an NSA lawyer at the time of Snowden's NSA revelations, told Marcy Wheeler writing for The New Republic in January 2018, that Greenwald was only relaying \"surface commentary\" rather than evidence for or against Russian interference in the 2016 election.[105] Tamsin Shaw wrote in The New York Review of Books in September 2018: \"Greenwald has repeatedly, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, decried as Russophobia the findings that Putin ordered interference in the 2016 US presidential election\".[106]\nGreenwald remained doubtful of assertions that the Trump presidential campaign worked with the Russians after the release of the letter about the Mueller's findings from attorney general William Barr in late March 2019. He called the investigation \"a scam and a fraud from the beginning\" in an appearance on Democracy Now!.[107] Greenwald told Tucker Carlson on Fox News: \"Let me just say, [MSNBC] should have their top host on primetime go before the cameras and hang their head in shame and apologize for lying to people for three straight years, exploiting their fears to great profit\".[108] He said he is formally banned from appearing on MSNBC, citing confirmations from two unnamed producers for the network, for his criticisms of its coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. MSNBC stated it has not barred Greenwald from appearing on its programs.[109]\nAfter the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, on April 22 he wrote that the press continued to report that Trump's campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.[110] In January 2020, Greenwald described the various assertions regarding Russian influence on American politics as \"At the very best, ... wildly exaggerated hysteria and the kind of jingoistic fear-mongering that\u2019s plagued U.S. Politics since the end of WWII\".[111]\n\nLater comments[edit]\nIn conversation around 2021 with Glenn Beck, Greenwald said:\n\n\"The Democratic Party is a party that I view as completely repressive and not just the Democratic Party but the liberal movement that supports it. By liberal, just to be clear, I don't mean the far left, the kind of left-wing movement that supported Bernie Sanders\u2014a lot of them hate Democrats at least as much as people on the right. I mean establishment liberals of the Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton strain.\"[73]\nOn Twitter, he wrote in March 2021:\n\"If you think the real power centers in the US are the Proud Boys, 4chan, & Boogaloos rather than the CIA, FBI, NSA, Wall Street and Silicon Valley, and spend most of your time battling the former while serving the latter as stenographers, your journalism is definitionally shit.\"[112]\nIn May 2021, he tweeted:\n\n\"The cultural left (meaning the part of the left focused on cultural issues rather than imperialism or corporatism) ... has become increasingly censorious, moralising, controlling, repressive, petulant, joyless, self-victimising, trivial and status-quo-perpetuating.\"[113]\nIsrael and allegations of antisemitism[edit]\nGreenwald is a strong critic of both Benjamin Netanyahu and Jair Bolsonaro.\nGreenwald has criticized the Israeli government, including its foreign policy, claimed influence on U.S. politics and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.[114][115] In May 2016, Greenwald accused The New York Times of \"abject cowardice\" in its use of quotation marks for the occupation of Gaza and alleged \"journalistic malfeasance\" in the incident \"out of fear of the negative reaction by influential factions\". After Greenwald's criticism, the New York Times removed the quotation marks in the article he had criticised.[116][117]\nJeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic in January 2012 said Greenwald \"evinces toward Israel a disdain that is quite breathtaking. He holds Israel to a standard he doesn't hold any other country, except the U.S.\"[118] Liel Leibovitz in Tablet magazine in 2013 considered it \"largely inaccurate\" to match Greenwald's \"obsessive focus on Israel\u2019s supposed role in evil global conspiracies to simple anti-Semitism. Instead, the ideology that drives [his] tendency to see the NSA and Israel as two heads of the same Satanic beast is more complex and ideologically-driven\u2014an attack on the doctrines of exceptionalism that fueled the rise of both America and Israel.\"[119]\nFollowing the Charlie Hebdo murders in January 2015, David Bernstein in The Washington Post wrote Greenwald (in an Intercept article) \"certainly appears to believe that Der Sturmer-like anti-Semitic cartoons are the moral and logical equivalent of making fun of Moses or Muhammed.\"[120]\nIn an exchange with Greenwald in February 2019, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., tweeted, \"It's all about the Benjamins baby\", suggesting that money rather than principle motivated US politicians' support for Israel, including payments from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) to US politicians. Many Democrats and Republicans, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, condemned the tweet arguing it perpetuated an antisemitic stereotype of Jewish money and influence fueling American politicians' support of Israel.[121] Greenwald defended Omar: \"we\u2019re not allowed to talk about an equally potent well-organized and well-financed lobby that ensures a bipartisan consensus in support of U.S. defense of Israel, that the minute that you mention that lobby, you get attacked as being anti-Semitic.\"[122]\n\nJulian Assange[edit]\nIn a November 2018 Guardian article, Luke Harding and Dan Collyns cited anonymous sources which stated that Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret meetings with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2013, 2015, and 2016.[123] Greenwald said that if Manafort had entered the Ecuadorian consulate, there would be evidence from the surrounding cameras.[124] Greenwald, a former contributor to The Guardian, stated that the paper \"has such a pervasive and unprofessionally personal hatred for Julian Assange that it has frequently dispensed with all journalistic standards in order to malign him.\"[125]\nGreenwald criticized the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act of 1917 for his role in the 2010 publication of the Iraq War documents leak. Greenwald wrote in The Washington Post: \"The Trump administration has undoubtedly calculated that Assange\u2019s uniquely unpopular status across the political spectrum [in the United States] makes him the ideal test case for creating a precedent that criminalizes the defining attributes of investigative journalism.\"[126]\n\nJair Bolsonaro[edit]\nIn October 2018, Greenwald said that Bolsonaro was \"often depicted wrongly in the Western media as being Brazil's Trump, and he's actually much closer to say Filipino President Duterte or even the Egyptian dictator General el-Sisi in terms of what he believes and what he's probably capable of carrying out.\"[127]\nGreenwald said that Bolsonaro could be a \"good partner\" for President Trump \"If you think that the U.S. should go back to kind of the Monroe Doctrine as [National Security Adviser] John Bolton talked openly about, and ruling Latin America, and U.S. interests\".[128]\nGreenwald has faced death threats and homophobic harassment from Bolsonaro supporters due to his reporting on leaked Telegram messages about Brazil's Operation Car Wash and Bolsonaro's justice minister S\u00e9rgio Moro.[78] President Bolsonaro threatened Greenwald with possible imprisonment. The Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism condemned Bolsonaro's threats.[129]\nIn January 2020, Brazilian federal prosecutors charged Greenwald with cybercrimes, alleging he was part of a \"criminal organization\" that hacked into the cellphones of prosecutors and other public officials in 2019. Prosecutors said he played a \"clear role in facilitating the commission of a crime\" by, for example, encouraging hackers to delete archives to cover their tracks. Greenwald, who was not detained, called the charges \"an obvious attempt to attack a free press in retaliation for the revelations we reported about Minister of Justice S\u00e9rgio Moro and the Bolsonaro government.\"[130] In February 2020, a federal judge dismissed the charges against Greenwald, citing a ruling from Supreme Court justice Gilmar Mendes that shielded him.[9]\n\nImmigration[edit]\nIn 2005, Greenwald criticized illegal immigration, saying that it would result in a \"parade of evils\" and arguing that large numbers of illegal immigrants could not be assimilated and would \"wreak havoc\". He subsequently disavowed that belief.[131][132]\n\nAnimal rights and veganism[edit]\nGreenwald is a vegan and an advocate for animal rights.[133][134][135] He and his husband Miranda once owned 24 rescue dogs.[71][136] In March 2017, Greenwald announced plans to build a shelter with Miranda for stray pets in Brazil that would be staffed by homeless people.[137] In March 2018, Greenwald tweeted videos showing the shelter operating.[138]\n\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine[edit]\nIn an appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Greenwald expressed support for the Ukraine biolabs conspiracy theory.[139][140][141]\nIn 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine placed Greenwald on a list of public figures who it alleges promote Russian propaganda.[142]\n\nReception[edit]\nGreenwald has been placed on numerous \"top 50\" and \"top 25\" lists of columnists in the United States.[152] In June 2012, Newsweek magazine named him one of America's Top Ten Opinionists, saying that \"a righteous, controlled, and razor-sharp fury runs through a great deal\" of his writing, and: \"His independent persuasion can make him a danger or an asset to both sides of the aisle.\"[153]\n\nGreenwald in Auckland, New Zealand, September 2014\nJosh Voorhees, writing for Slate, reported that in 2013 congressman Peter King (R-NY) suggested Greenwald should be arrested for his reporting on the NSA PRISM program and NSA leaker Edward Snowden.[154] Journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin said \"I would arrest [Snowden] and now I'd almost arrest Glenn Greenwald\",[155] but later made an apology for his statement, which Greenwald accepted.\n\nStanding ovation for Greenwald, Germany, December 2014\nIn a February 2014 interview, Greenwald said he risked detention if he reentered the U.S., but insisted that he would \"force the issue\" on principle, and return for the \"many reasons\" he had to visit, including if he won a prestigious award of which he was rumoured to be the winner.[156] Later that month, it was announced that he was, in fact, among the recipients of the 2013 Polk Awards, to be conferred April 11, 2014, in Manhattan.[157] In a subsequent interview, Greenwald stated he would attend the ceremony.[158] On April 11, Greenwald and Laura Poitras accepted the Polk Award in Manhattan. Their entry into the United States was trouble-free and they traveled with an ACLU attorney and a German journalist \"to document any unpleasant surprises\". Accepting the award, Greenwald said he was \"happy to see a table full of Guardian editors and journalists, whose role in this story is much more integral than the publicity generally recognizes\".[159] On April 14, the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service was awarded jointly to The Guardian and The Washington Post for revelation of widespread secret surveillance by the NSA. Greenwald, along with Laura Poitras and Ewen MacAskill, had contributed to The Guardian\u2032s reporting.[160]\nIn 2014, Sean Wilentz wrote in The New Republic, that some of Greenwald's opinions were where the far-left and far-right meet, characterizing his views as falling \"often, but not always under the rubric of libertarianism.\"[161] In a 2017 article in The Independent, Brian Dean wrote: \"Greenwald has been critical of Trump, but is perceived by many as someone who spends far more time criticising 'Dems' and 'liberals' (analysis of his Twitter account tends to give this impression).\"[162] Simon van Zuylen-Wood in a 2018 piece for New York magazine entitled \"Does Glenn Greenwald Know More Than Robert Mueller?\" described \"a new-seeming category of Russia-skeptic firebrands sometimes called the alt-left.\"[163] In February 2019, Max Boot wrote in The Washington Post: \"Indeed, it's often hard to tell the extremists apart. Anti-vaccine activists come from both the far left and the far right \u2014 and while most of those who defend President Trump's dealings with Russia are on the right, some, such as Glenn Greenwald and Stephen F. Cohen, are on the left.\"[164] In a May 2019 Haaretz article, Alexander Reid Ross described Tucker Carlson's and Glenn Greenwald's positions as being a \"crossover between leftists and the far-right in defense of Syria's Bashar Assad, to dismiss charges of Russian interference in U.S. elections and to boost Russian geopolitics\".[165]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 2005, the then 38-year-old Greenwald took a long vacation to Rio de Janeiro where he met David Miranda, a then 19-year-old who had spent his childhood in the Jacarezinho Favela.[166] Days after they met, the couple decided to move in together; the two would later marry.[167] Miranda later served as a Congressman with the left-wing PDT party, having formerly represented the PSOL party.[166] The couple lived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[168][167] In 2017, Greenwald and Miranda announced that they had gained legal guardianship of two brothers, who are from Macei\u00f3, a city in Northeastern Brazil.[169][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed][170] They formally adopted the two boys in Brazil in 2018.[171]\nGreenwald and Miranda were close personal friends of Brazilian human rights advocate and politician Marielle Franco, known for criticism of police tactics and corruption, who was fatally shot by unknown assailants.[172][173] A New York Times profile described how Greenwald's reporting on high-level Bolsonaro officials and Miranda's outspoken opposition in Congress turned them into primary targets of Bolsonaro's administration.[79]\nWhile Greenwald does not participate in any organized religion, he has said he believes in \"the spiritual and mystical part of the world\" and that yoga is \"like a bridge into that, like a window into it.\"[174] Greenwald has been critical of the New Atheist movement, in particular, Sam Harris and other critics of Islam.[175]\nOn May 9, 2023, Greenwald announced via Twitter that Miranda had died in a Rio de Janeiro hospital. Miranda had been treated for nine months in the hospital's ICU for a gastrointestinal infection.[176][177]\n\nRecognition[edit]\nGeschwister-Scholl-Award for Greenwald, University of Munich, December 2014\nGreenwald received, together with Amy Goodman, the first Izzy Award for special achievement in independent media, in 2009,[178] and the 2010 Online Journalism Award for Best Commentary for his investigative work on the conditions of Chelsea Manning.[179]\nHis reporting on the National Security Agency (NSA) won numerous other awards around the world, including top investigative journalism prizes from the George Polk Award for National Security Reporting,[180] the 2013 Online Journalism Awards,[181] the Esso Award for Excellence in Reporting in Brazil for his articles in O Globo on NSA mass surveillance of Brazilians (becoming the first foreigner to win the award),[182] the 2013 Libertad de Expresion Internacional award from Argentinian magazine Perfil,[183] and the 2013 Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.[184] The team that Greenwald led at The Guardian was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their reporting on the NSA.[185] Foreign Policy Magazine then named him one of the top 100 Global Thinkers of 2013.[186]\nIn 2014, Greenwald received the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis, an annual German literary award, for the German edition of No Place to Hide.[187] Greenwald was also named the 2014 recipient of the McGill Medal for Journalistic Courage[188] from the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication of the University of Georgia.[189]\n\nBibliography[edit]\n2021 Securing Democracy: My Fight for Press Freedom and Justice in Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil.

Lowry.\nGlenn LouryLoury in 2012BornGlenn Cartman Loury (1948-09-03) September 3, 1948 (age\u00a075)Chicago, Illinois, U.S.EducationNorthwestern University (BA)Massachusetts Institute of Technology (PhD)SpouseLinda Datcher LouryChildren4Academic careerInstitutionsUniversity of MichiganBoston UniversityBrown UniversityHarvard UniversityFieldSocial economicsDoctoraladvisorRobert Solow[1]InfluencesGary BeckerThomas SowellContributionsCoate-Loury modelInformation at IDEAS\u00a0/\u00a0RePEc\n\nGlenn Cartman Loury, (born September 3, 1948[2]) is an American economist, academic, and author. He is the Merton P. Stoltz Professor of the Social Sciences and Professor of Economics at Brown University, where he has taught since 2005.[3] At the age of 33, Loury became the first African American professor of economics at Harvard University to gain tenure.\nLoury achieved prominence during the Reagan Era as a leading black conservative intellectual.[4][5] In the mid-1990s, following a period of seclusion, he adopted more  progressive views.[6] Loury has somewhat re-aligned with views of the American right, with The New York Times describing his political orientation in 2020 as \"conservative-leaning.\"[7][8][9]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nLoury was born on September 3, 1948, in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, growing up in a redlined neighborhood. Before going to college he fathered two children, and supported them with a job in a printing plant. When he wasn't working he took classes at Southeast Junior College, where he won a scholarship to study at Northwestern University.[10][11] In 1972, he received his B.A. degree in mathematics from Northwestern University. He received his Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1976, writing his dissertation, \"Essays in the Theory of the Distribution of Income\", under the supervision of Robert M. Solow.[12] At MIT he met his future wife, Linda Datcher Loury.[13]\n\nCareer[edit]\nLoury became an assistant professor of economics at Northwestern University after receiving his doctorate. In 1979, he moved to teach at the University of Michigan, and was promoted to full professor of economics in 1980.\nIn 1982, at age 33, Loury became the first black tenured professor of economics in the history of Harvard University.[4] \nHe moved to Harvard's Kennedy School of Government after two years.[14] While at Kennedy school he would befriend William Bennett and Bill Kristol[4]\n(He later said in an interview that his economics appointment was a mistake because he \"wasn\u2019t yet fully established as a scientist\".[15])\nIn 1987, Loury was under consideration to be an Undersecretary of Education in the Reagan administration. He withdrew from consideration on June 1, three days before citing personal reasons.[16]\nAfter a subsequent period of seclusion and self-reflection, Loury reemerged as a born-again Christian and described himself as a \"black progressive.\"[17]\nLoury left Harvard in 1991 to go to Boston University, where he headed the Institute on Race and Social Division. In 2005, Loury left Boston University for Brown University, where he was named a professor in the Economics Department, and a research associate of the Population Studies and Training Center.\nLoury's areas of study include applied microeconomic theory: welfare economics, game theory, industrial organization, natural resource economics, and the economics of income distribution. In addition to economics, he has also written extensively on the themes of racial inequality and social policy.[18] Loury testified on racial issues before the Senate Banking Committee on March 4, 2021.[19] and presented at the Bruce D. Benson Center Lecture Series at the University of Colorado Boulder on February 8, 2021.[citation needed]\nLoury hosts The Glenn Show on his Substack with John McWhorter, often regarding questions of race and education.[20][non-primary source needed]\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nOn a 2017 episode of the Sam Harris podcast Waking Up, Loury stated that while he used to be \"a Reagan conservative\", he now thought of himself as a \"centrist Democrat, or maybe a mildly right-of-center Democrat.\"[21] The New York Times described Loury as \"conservative-leaning\" and The Wall Street Journal described Loury as a \u201cReagan Republican\u201d.[22][23]\nHe has spoken out in opposition to cancel culture.[24] On January 9, 2007, Loury spoke out against increasing the number of troops in Iraq.[25]\n\nPresidential elections and candidates[edit]\nLoury was opposed to Barack Obama in his 2008 presidential run.[26] He continued to criticize Obama as president calling his tenure \u201cdepressing in the extreme\".[27] He also criticized Obama's closeness to Al Sharpton.[28]\nIn 2016, he supported Hillary Clinton.[29] After the 2016 United States presidential election, Loury said it was dangerous for people not to recognize Donald Trump as the 45th President.  During debates with John McWhorter, Loury defended Donald Trump.[30] During Trump's presidency he doubted claims that Trump was an existential threat to the public. After Trump refused to concede that he lost the 2020 United States presidential election, however, he rebuked Trump.[31] Loury would later blame Trump for the 2021 United States Capitol attack but opposed the second impeachment of Donald Trump.[32]\n\nRace[edit]\nLoury opposes reparations for slavery and affirmative action.[16][33] He has said that \"affirmative action is not the solution, but neither is it the problem\".[34] Conversely, he has criticized affirmative action saying, \"Affirmative action is dishonest. It\u2019s not about equality, it\u2019s about covering ass\".[35][36]\nIn 1984, Loury drew the attention of critics with \"A New American Dilemma\", published in The New Republic, a piece in which he addressed what he termed \"fundamental failures in black society\" such as \"the lagging academic performance of black students, the disturbingly high rate of black-on-black crime, and the alarming increase in early unwed pregnancies among blacks\".[37]\nIn June 2020, Loury published a rebuttal to a letter that Brown University president Christina Paxson sent to students and alumni in response to the murder of George Floyd by a policeman. Loury questioned the purpose of Paxson's letter, saying it either \"affirmed platitudes to which we can all subscribe, or, more menacingly, it asserted controversial and arguable positions as though they were axiomatic certainties.\"[38]\n\nImmigration[edit]\nOn immigration, Loury said in an interview segment in The First Measured Century, \"There are benefits of immigration, and there are also costs. The benefits in terms of cheaper, eager labor to help we Americans produce the products that we want to consume. The costs are in terms of making it more difficult to equalize the economic circumstances of some Americans who are at the bottom of the heap, because they now have more competition for their labor, as a result of immigration.\"[39]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\nLoury was elected as a member of the Econometric Society in 1994, Vice President of the American Economics Society in 1997, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000, and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2011.[40][41][42] He was elected president of the Eastern Economics Association in 2013. Loury is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and is a main academic contributor to the 1776 Unites project. He received the Bradley Prize in 2022, and was named the John Kenneth Galbraith Fellow from the American Academy of Political & Social Science for that same year.[43][44]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nLoury fathered two children as a teenager.[45]\nLoury and his wife, Linda Datcher Loury, had two sons together.[45] Linda died in 2011.[13] He has since remarried.[46]\n\nPublications[edit]\nLoury, Glenn (1995).

Also in 1971, she co-founded the Women's Action Alliance which, until 1997, provided support to a network of feminist activists and worked to advance feminist causes and legislation. In the 1990s, Steinem helped establish Take Our Daughters to Work Day, an occasion for young girls to learn about future career opportunities.[7] In 2005, Steinem, Jane Fonda, and Robin Morgan co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that \"works to make women visible and powerful in the media.\"[8]\nAs of May\u00a02018[update], Steinem was traveling internationally as an organizer and lecturer, and was a media spokeswoman on issues of equality.[9]\nIn 2015, Steinem, alongside two Nobel Peace Laureates (Mairead Maguire of Northern Ireland and Leymah Gbowee of Liberia[10]), Abigail Disney, and other prominent women peace activists, undertook a journey from the capital of North Korea, Pyongyang to South Korea, crossing the most heavily militarized zone in the world between the two Koreas.\n\nSteinem speaking with supporters at the Women Together Arizona Summit at Carpenters Local Union in Phoenix, Arizona, September 2016.\n\nEarly life[edit]\nSteinem was born on March 25, 1934, in Toledo, Ohio,[4] the daughter of Ruth (n\u00e9e Nuneviller) and Leo Steinem. Her mother was Presbyterian, mostly of German (including Prussian) and some Scottish descent.[11][12] Her father was Jewish, the son of immigrants from W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, and Radziej\u00f3w, Poland.[12][13][14][15] Her paternal grandmother, Pauline Perlmutter Steinem, was chairwoman of the educational committee of the National Woman Suffrage Association, a delegate to the 1908 International Council of Women, and the first woman to be elected to the Toledo Board of Education, as well as a leader in the movement for vocational education.[16] Pauline also rescued many members of her family from the Holocaust.[16]\nThe Steinems lived and traveled about in a trailer, from which Leo carried out his trade as a roaming antiques dealer.[16] Before Gloria was born, her mother, Ruth, then age 34, had a \"nervous breakdown\" which left her an invalid, trapped in delusional fantasies that occasionally turned violent.[17] She changed \"from an energetic, fun-loving, book-loving\" woman into \"someone who was afraid to be alone, who could not hang on to reality long enough to hold a job, and who could rarely concentrate enough to read a book.\"[17] Ruth spent long periods in and out of sanatoriums for the mentally ill.[17] Steinem was ten years old when her parents separated in 1944.[17] Her father went to California to find work, while she and her mother continued to live together in Toledo.[18][17]\nWhile her parents divorced under the stress of her mother's illness, Steinem did not attribute it at all to male chauvinism on the father's part\u2014she claims to have \"understood and never blamed him for the breakup.\"[19] Nevertheless, the impact of these events had a formative effect on her personality: while her father, a traveling salesman, had never provided much financial stability to the family, his exit aggravated their situation.[20] Steinem concluded that her mother's inability to hold on to a job was evidence of general hostility towards working women.[20] She also concluded that the general apathy of doctors towards her mother emerged from a similar anti-woman animus.[20] Years later, Steinem described her mother's experience as pivotal to her understanding of social injustices.[21]:\u200a129\u2013138\u200a These perspectives convinced Steinem that women lacked social and political equality.[21]\nSteinem attended Waite High School in Toledo and Western High School in Washington, D.C., graduating from the latter while living with her older sister Susanne Steinem Patch.[22][23] She then attended Smith College,[24] an institution with which she continues to remain engaged, from which she received her A.B. magna cum laude and graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[clarification needed][9]\nIn 1957, Steinem had an abortion. The procedure was performed by Dr. John Sharpe, a British physician, when abortion was still illegal.[25] Years later, Steinem dedicated her memoir My Life on the Road (2015)[26] to him. She wrote,\n\"Dr. John Sharpe of London, who in 1957, a decade before physicians in England could legally perform an abortion for any reason other than the health of the woman, took the considerable risk of referring for an abortion a twenty-two-year-old American on her way to India. Knowing only that she had broken an engagement at home to seek an unknown fate, he said, 'You must promise me two things. First, you will not tell anyone my name. Second, you will do what you want to do with your life.'\"[27]\nIn the late 1950s, Steinem spent two years in India as a Chester Bowles Asian Fellow. After returning to the United States, she served as director of the Independent Research Service, an organization funded in secret by a donor that turned out to be the CIA.[28] She worked to send non-Communist American students to the 1959 World Youth Festival.[28] In 1960, she was hired by Warren Publishing as the first employee of Help! magazine.[29]\nIn 1950s, she was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, and later she went ahead to model her campaign after Gandhi's independence movement.[30][31]\n\nJournalism[edit]\nEsquire magazine features editor Clay Felker gave freelance writer Steinem what she later called her first \"serious assignment\", regarding contraception; he didn't like her first draft and had her re-write the article.[32] Her resulting 1962 article about the way in which women are forced to choose between a career and marriage preceded Betty Friedan's book The Feminine Mystique by one year.[32][33]\nIn 1963, while working on an article for Huntington Hartford's Show magazine, Steinem was employed as a Playboy Bunny at the New York Playboy Club.[34] The article, published in 1963 as \"A Bunny's Tale\", featured a photo of Steinem in Bunny uniform and detailed how women were treated at those clubs.[35] Steinem has maintained that she is proud of the work she did publicizing the exploitative working conditions of the bunnies and especially the sexual demands made of them, which skirted the edge of the law.[36][37] However, for a brief period after the article was published, Steinem was unable to land other assignments; in her words, this was \"because I had now become a Bunny\u2014and it didn't matter why.\"[36][38]  However, on the upside, the article compelled the owner of Playboy, Hugh Hefner, to review and improve the working conditions of the Bunnies.\nIn the interim, she conducted an interview with John Lennon for Cosmopolitan magazine in 1964.[39] In 1965, she wrote for NBC-TV's weekly satirical revue, That Was The Week That Was (TW3), contributing a regular segment entitled \"Surrealism in Everyday Life\".[40] Steinem eventually landed a job at Felker's newly founded New York magazine in 1968.[32]\nIn 1969, she covered an abortion speak-out for New York Magazine, which was held in a church basement in Greenwich Village, New York.[41][42] Steinem had had an abortion herself in London at the age of 22.[43] She felt what she called a \"big click\" at the speak-out, and later said she didn't \"begin my life as an active feminist\" until that day.[42] As she recalled, \"It [abortion] is supposed to make us a bad person. But I must say, I never felt that. I used to sit and try and figure out how old the child would be, trying to make myself feel guilty. But I never could! I think the person who said: 'Honey, if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament' was right. Speaking for myself, I knew it was the first time I had taken responsibility for my own life. I wasn't going to let things happen to me. I was going to direct my life, and therefore it felt positive. But still, I didn't tell anyone. Because I knew that out there it wasn't [positive].\"[43] She also said, \"In later years, if I'm remembered at all it will be for inventing a phrase like 'reproductive freedom'\u00a0 ... as a phrase it includes the freedom to have children or not to. So it makes it possible for us to make a coalition.\"[44]\n\nThe first issue of Ms., released in 1972\nIn 1972, she co-founded the feminist magazine Ms. alongside founding editors Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Mary Thom, Patricia Carbine, Joanne Edgar, Nina Finkelstein, Dorothy Pitman Hughes, and Mary Peacock; it began as a special edition of New York, and Clay Felker funded the first issue.[32] Its 300,000 test copies sold out nationwide in eight days.[45][46] Within weeks, Ms. had received 26,000 subscription orders and more than 20,000 reader letters.[46] In 1974, Ms. collaborated with public television to produce the television program Woman Alive!, and Steinem was featured in the first episode in her role as co-founder of Ms. magazine.[47] The magazine was sold to the Feminist Majority Foundation in 2001; Steinem remains on the masthead as one of six founding editors and serves on the advisory board.[46]\nAlso in 1972, Steinem became the first woman to speak at the National Press Club.[48]\nIn November 1977, Steinem spoke at the 1977 National Women's Conference among other speakers including Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford, Lady Bird Johnson, Bella Abzug, Barbara Jordan, Cecilia Burciaga, Lenore Hershey, and Jean O'Leary.[49]\nIn 1978, Steinem wrote a semi-satirical essay for Cosmopolitan titled \"If Men Could Menstruate\" in which she imagined a world where men menstruate instead of women. She concludes in the essay that in such a world, menstruation would become a badge of honor with men comparing their relative sufferings,  rather than the source of shame that it had been for women.[50]\nOn March 22, 1998, Steinem published an op-ed in The New York Times (\"Feminists and the Clinton Question\") in which she claimed that Bill Clinton's alleged behavior did not constitute sexual harassment, although she did not actually challenge the accounts by his accusers.[51] The op-ed was criticized by various writers, as in the Harvard Crimson[52] and in the Times itself.[53] In 2017, Steinem, in an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian, stood by her 1998 New York Times op-ed, but also said: \"I wouldn't write the same thing now.\"[54]\n\nActivism[edit]\nIn 1959, Steinem led a group of activists in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to organize the Independent Service for Information on the Vienna festival, to advocate for American participation in the World Youth Festival, a Soviet-sponsored youth event.\nIn 1968, Steinem signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.[55]\nIn 1969, she published an article, \"After Black Power, Women's Liberation\"[56] which brought her to national fame as a feminist leader.[6] As such she campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in its favor in 1970.[57][58] That same year she published her essay on a utopia of gender equality, \"What It Would Be Like If Women Win\", in Time magazine.[59]\nOn July 10, 1971, Steinem was one of more than three hundred women who founded the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC), including such notables as Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan, Shirley Chisholm, and Myrlie Evers-Williams.[60] As a co-convener of the Caucus, she delivered the speech \"Address to the Women of America\", stating in part:\n\nThis is no simple reform. It really is a revolution. Sex and race because they are easy and visible differences have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labor on which this system still depends. We are talking about a society in which there will be no roles other than those chosen or those earned. We are really talking about humanism.[61]\nIn 1972, she ran as a delegate for Shirley Chisholm in New York, but lost.[62]\nIn March 1973, she addressed the first national conference of Stewardesses for Women's Rights, which she continued to support throughout its existence.[63] Stewardesses for Women's Rights folded in the spring of 1976.[63]\nDespite her influence in the feminist movement, Steinem also earned criticism from some feminists as well, who questioned whether she was committed to the movement or using it to promote her glamorous image.[64] The Redstockings also singled her out for agreeing to cooperate with the CIA-backed Independent Research Service.[64] It was also acknowledged that Steinem worked as a CIA agent when this operation was taking place.[65][66]\nSteinem, who grew up reading Wonder Woman comics, was also a key player in the restoration of Wonder Woman's powers and traditional costume, which were restored in issue #204 (January\u2013February 1973).[67]  Steinem, offended that the most famous female superhero had been depowered, had placed Wonder Woman (in costume) on the cover of the first issue of Ms. (1972)\u2014Warner Communications, DC Comics' owner, was an investor\u2014which also contained an appreciative essay about the character.[67][68] In doing so, however, Steinem forced the firing of Samuel R. Delany who had taken over scripting duties with issue #202. Delany was supposed to write a six-issue story arc, which would culminate in a battle over an abortion clinic where Wonder Woman was to defend women trying to use their services, a critical feminist issue at the time. The story outlines and the work already done on the issues was scrapped, something that Steinem was not aware of and made no attempt to rectify.[69]\nIn 1976, the first women-only Passover seder was held in Esther M. Broner's New York City apartment and led by Broner, with 13 women attending, including Steinem.[70]\nIn 1977, Steinem became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP).[71] WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.\nIn 1984, Steinem was arrested along with a number of members of Congress and civil rights activists for disorderly conduct outside the South African embassy while protesting against the South African apartheid system.[72]\nAt the outset of the Gulf War in 1991, Steinem, along with prominent feminists Robin Morgan and Kate Millett, publicly opposed an incursion into the Middle East and asserted that ostensible goal of \"defending democracy\" was a pretense.[73]\nDuring the Clarence Thomas sexual harassment scandal in 1991, Steinem voiced strong support for Anita Hill and suggested that one day Hill herself would sit on the Supreme Court.[74]\nIn 1992, Steinem co-founded Choice USA, a non-profit organization that mobilizes and provides ongoing support to a younger generation that lobbies for reproductive choice.[75][76][77]\nIn 1993, Steinem co-produced and narrated an Emmy Award-winning TV documentary for HBO about child abuse, called, \"Multiple Personalities: The Search for Deadly Memories\".[9] Also in 1993, she and Rosilyn Heller co-produced an original TV movie for Lifetime, \"Better Off Dead\", which examined the parallel forces that both oppose abortion and support the death penalty.[9]\nShe contributed the piece \"The Media and the Movement: A User's Guide\" to the 2003 anthology Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium, edited by Robin Morgan.[78]\nOn June 1, 2013, Steinem performed on stage at the \"Chime For Change: The Sound Of Change Live\" Concert at Twickenham Stadium in London, England.[79] Later in 2014, UN Women began its commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, and as part of that campaign Steinem (and others) spoke at the Apollo Theater in New York City.[80] Chime For Change was funded by Gucci, focusing on using innovative approaches to raise funds and awareness especially regarding girls and women.[79][81]\nSteinem has stated, \"I think the fact that I've become a symbol for the women's movement is somewhat accidental. A woman member of Congress, for example, might be identified as a member of Congress; it doesn't mean she's any less of a feminist but she's identified by her nearest male analog. Well, I don't have a male analog so the press has to identify me with the movement. I suppose I could be referred to as a journalist, but because Ms. is part of a movement and not just a typical magazine, I'm more likely to be identified with the movement. There's no other slot to put me in.\"[82]\nContrary to popular belief, Steinem did not coin the feminist slogan \"A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle\". Although she helped popularize it, the phrase is actually attributable to Irina Dunn.[83] When Time magazine published an article attributing the saying to Steinem, Steinem wrote a letter saying the phrase had been coined by Dunn.[84]\nAnother phrase sometimes wrongly attributed to Steinem is: \"If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.\" Steinem herself attributed it to \"an old Irish woman taxi driver in Boston\", whom she said she and Florynce Kennedy met.[85]\n\nSteinem joins Women Cross DMZ[edit]\nOn May 24, 2015, International Women's Day for Disarmament, thirty women\u2014 including two Nobel Peace laureates and retired Colonel Ann Wright\u2014 from 15 countries linked arms with 10,000 Korean women, stationing themselves on both sides of the DMZ to urge a formal end to the Korean War (1950-1953), the reunification of families divided during the war, and a peace building process with women in leadership positions to resolve seventy years of hostility following WWII.[86] It was unusual for South Korea and North Korea to reach consensus on allowing peace activists to enter the tense border area, one of the world's most dangerous places, where hundreds of thousands of troops are stationed in a heavily mined zone that divides South Korea from nuclear North Korea.[10]\nIn addition to Steinem, participants in crossing the DMZ included organizer Christine Ahn from Hawaii; feminist Suzuyo Takazato from Okinawa; Amnesty International human rights lawyer Erika Guevara of Mexico; Liberian peace and reconciliation advocate Leymah Gbowee; Philippines lawmaker Liza Maza; Northern Ireland peace activist Mairead Maguire and Colonel Ann Wright, a retired officer who resigned from the U.S. military to protest the US invasion of Iraq.\nSteinem was the honorary co-chairwoman of 2015 Women's Walk For Peace In Korea with Mairead Maguire, and in the weeks leading up to the walk Steinem told the press, \"It's hard to imagine any more physical symbol of the insanity of dividing human beings.\"[10] The group's main goal is to advocate disarmament and seek Korea's reunification. It will be holding international peace symposiums both in Pyongyang and Seoul in which women from both North Korea and South Korea can share experiences and ideas of mobilizing women to stop the Korean crisis. It is especially believed that the role of women in this act would help and support the reunification of family members divided by the split prolonged for 70 years.[87][88][89][90]\nShe is also the chair of the advisory board of Apne Aap Women Worldwide, an organization fighting sex trafficking and inter-generational prostitution in India, founded by Ruchira Gupta.[91] She has also written extensively on her travels, experiences with women and the Indian feminist movement with her colleague and friend, Ruchira Gupta.[92][93]\nIn 2014, Steinem and Gupta traveled through India to meet the country's young feminists, writers, and thought leaders. A diary was kept documenting their travels, \"Notes on A Tour of the Indian Women's Movement\".\nSince 2011, Steinem has been one co-conveners of the Frontline Women's Fund, a project of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute along with former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay and Jessica Neuwirth. The Frontline Women's Fund is a fund for women that strengthens frontline women's rights activists around the world by increasing their access to financial resources, political leaders, and media visibility. Today they support 15 partner organizations in 13 countries and manage two thematic funds \u2013 the Gloria Steinem Equality Fund to End Sex Trafficking with 13 grantees and the Efua Dorkenoo Fund to End Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) with 5 grantees.\n\nInvolvement in political campaigns[edit]\nSteinem's involvement in presidential campaigns stretches back to her support of Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential campaign.[94]\n\n1968 election[edit]\nA proponent of civil rights and fierce critic of the Vietnam War, Steinem was initially drawn to Senator Eugene McCarthy because of his \"admirable record\" on those issues, but after meeting him and hearing him speak, she found him \"cautious, uninspired, and dry\".[21]:\u200a87\u200a As the campaign progressed, Steinem became baffled at \"personally vicious\" attacks that McCarthy leveled against his primary opponent Robert F. Kennedy, even as \"his real opponent, Hubert Humphrey, went free\".[21]:\u200a88\u200a\nOn a late-night radio show, Steinem garnered attention for declaring \"George McGovern is the real Eugene McCarthy\".[95] In 1968, Steinem was chosen to pitch the arguments to McGovern as to why he should enter the presidential race that year; he agreed, and Steinem \"consecutively or simultaneously served as pamphlet writer, advance 'man', fund raiser, lobbyist of delegates, errand runner, and press secretary\".[21]:\u200a95\u200a\nMcGovern lost the nomination at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and Steinem later wrote of her astonishment at Hubert Humphrey's \"refusal even to suggest to Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley that he control the rampaging police and the bloodshed in the streets\".[21]:\u200a96\u200a\n\n1972 election[edit]\nSteinem at the LBJ Library in 1975\nAt the Women's Action Alliance news conference of January 12, 1972\nSteinem was reluctant to re-join the McGovern campaign, as although she had brought in McGovern's single largest campaign contributor in 1968, she \"still had been treated like a frivolous pariah by much of McGovern's campaign staff\". In April 1972, Steinem remarked that he \"still doesn't understand the Women's Movement\".[21]:\u200a114\u200a\nMcGovern ultimately excised the abortion issue from the party's platform, and recent publications show McGovern was deeply conflicted on the issue.[96] Steinem later wrote this description of the events:\n\nThe consensus of the meeting of women delegates held by the caucus had been to fight for the minority plank on reproductive freedom; indeed our vote had supported the plank nine to one.  So fight we did, with three women delegates speaking eloquently in its favor as a constitutional right. One male Right-to-Life zealot spoke against, and Shirley MacLaine also was an opposition speaker, on the grounds that this was a fundamental right but didn't belong in the platform. We made a good showing.  Clearly we would have won if McGovern's forces had left their delegates uninstructed and thus able to vote their consciences.[21]:\u200a100\u2013110\u200a\nGloria Steinem in 1977, photographed by Lynn Gilbert\nHowever, Germaine Greer flatly contradicted Steinem's account, reporting, \"Jacqui Ceballos called from the crowd to demand abortion rights on the Democratic platform, but Bella [Abzug] and Gloria stared glassily out into the room, thus killing the abortion rights platform\", and asking \"Why had Bella and Gloria not helped Jacqui to nail him on abortion? What reticence, what loserism had afflicted them?\"[97] Steinem later recalled that the 1972 Convention was the only time Greer and Steinem ever met.[98]\nThe cover of Harper's that month read, \"Womanlike, they did not want to get tough with their man, and so, womanlike, they got screwed\".[99]\n\n2004 election[edit]\nIn the run-up to the 2004 election, Steinem voiced fierce criticism of the Bush administration, asserting, \"There has never been an administration that has been more hostile to women's equality, to reproductive freedom as a fundamental human right, and has acted on that hostility\", adding, \"If he is elected in 2004, abortion will be criminalized in this country\".[100] At a Planned Parenthood event in Boston, Steinem declared Bush \"a danger to health and safety\", citing his antagonism to the Clean Water Act, reproductive freedom, sex education, and AIDS relief.[101]\n\n2008 election[edit]\nSteinem was an active participant in the 2008 presidential campaign, and praised both the Democratic front-runners, commenting,\n\nBoth Senators Clinton and Obama are civil rights advocates, feminists, environmentalists, and critics of the war in Iraq\u00a0 ... Both have resisted pandering to the right, something that sets them apart from any Republican candidate, including John McCain. Both have Washington and foreign policy experience; George W. Bush did not when he first ran for president.[102]\nNevertheless, Steinem endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton, citing her broader experience, and saying that the nation was in such bad shape it might require two terms of Clinton and two of Obama to fix it.[103]\nShe also made headlines for a New York Times op-ed in which she cited gender and not race as \"probably the most restricting force in American life\".[104]  She elaborated, \"Black men were given the vote a half-century before women of any race were allowed to mark a ballot, and generally have ascended to positions of power, from the military to the boardroom, before any women.\"[104]\nSteinem again drew attention for, according to the New York Observer, seeming \"to denigrate the importance of John McCain's time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam\"; Steinem's broader argument \"was that the media and the political world are too admiring of militarism in all its guises\".[105]\nFollowing McCain's selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate, Steinem penned an op-ed in which she labeled Palin an \"unqualified woman\" who \"opposes everything most other women want and need\", described her nomination speech as \"divisive and deceptive\", called for a more inclusive Republican Party, and concluded that Palin resembled \"Phyllis Schlafly, only younger\".[106]\n\n2016 election[edit]\nSteinem at an event campaigning for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in September 2016.\nIn an HBO interview with Bill Maher, Steinem, when asked to explain the broad support for Bernie Sanders among young Democratic women, responded, \"When you're young, you're thinking, 'Where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie.'\"[107] Her comments triggered widespread criticism, and Steinem later issued an apology and said her comments had been \"misinterpreted\".[108]\nSteinem endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[109] Steinem was an honorary co-chair of and speaker at the Women's March on Washington on January 21, 2017, the day after the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.[110]\n\nCIA ties and leader of Independent Research Service[edit]\nIn 1967, Steinem revealed in an interview with The New York Times that she worked full time from 1958 until 1962 at the Independent Research Service, which was largely financed by the CIA.[111] In May 1975, Redstockings, a radical feminist group, published a report that Steinem and others put together on the Vienna Youth Festival and its attendees for the Independent Research Service.[112][113] Redstockings raised the question of whether Steinem had continuing ties with the CIA, which Steinem denied.[114] Steinem defended her relationship to the CIA, saying: \"In my experience The Agency was completely different from its image; it was liberal, nonviolent and honorable.\"[65]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Steinem had a four-year relationship with the publisher Mortimer Zuckerman.[115][116][117][118]\nOn September 3, 2000, at age 66, Steinem married David Bale, father of actor Christian Bale.[24] The wedding was performed at the home of her friend Wilma Mankiller, the first female Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation.[119] Steinem technically became stepmother to Bale's four adult children; she has no biological children. Steinem and Bale were married for only three years before he died of brain lymphoma on December 30, 2003, at age 62.[120]\nSteinem was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1986[121] and trigeminal neuralgia in 1994.[122]\nCommenting on aging, Steinem says that as she approached 60 she felt like she entered a new phase in life that was free of the \"demands of gender\" that she faced from adolescence onward.[123]\nSteinem lives alone in New York's Upper East Side, where she owns the first three floors of her historic brownstone apartment building. In 2021, on her 87th birthday, Google Arts & Culture launched a virtual tour of her home, where she has lived since 1966.[124][125][126][127]\nWhen taking part in season 5 of Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr., comedian Tig Notaro discovered she and Steinem are distant cousins.[128]\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nGloria Steinem (right) and Alice Walker celebrate Steinem's 75th birthday in the Fall 2009 issue of Ms.\nAlthough most frequently considered a liberal feminist, Steinem has repeatedly characterized herself as a radical feminist.[129] More importantly, she has repudiated categorization within feminism as \"nonconstructive to specific problems\", saying: \"I've turned up in every category. So it makes it harder for me to take the divisions with great seriousness.\"[122] Nevertheless, on concrete issues, Steinem has staked several firm positions.\n\nFemale genital mutilation[edit]\nIn 1979, Steinem wrote the article on female genital mutilation that brought it into the American public's consciousness; the article \"The International Crime of Female Genital Mutilation\" was published in the March 1979 issue of Ms.[21]:\u200a292\u200a[130] The article reported on the \"75 million women suffering with the results of genital mutilation\".[21]:\u200a292\u200a[130] According to Steinem, \"The real reasons for genital mutilation can only be understood in the context of the \"patriarchy\": men must control women's bodies as the means of production, and thus repress the independent power of women's sexuality.\"[21]:\u200a292\u200a[130]\nSteinem's article contains the basic arguments that would later be developed by philosopher Martha Nussbaum.[131]\n\nFeminist theory[edit]\nSteinem at the LBJ Library in 2019\nSteinem has frequently voiced her disapproval of the obscurantism and abstractions some claim to be prevalent in feminist academic theorizing.[122][132] She said, \"Nobody cares about feminist academic writing. That's careerism. These poor women in academia have to talk this silly language that nobody can understand in order to be accepted\u00a0[...] But I recognize the fact that we have this ridiculous system of tenure, that the whole thrust of academia is one that values education, in my opinion, in inverse ratio to its usefulness\u2014and what you write in inverse relationship to its understandability.\"[122] Steinem later singled out deconstructionists like Judith Butler for criticism, saying, \"I always wanted to put a sign up on the road to Yale saying, 'Beware: Deconstruction Ahead'. Academics are forced to write in language no one can understand so that they get tenure. They have to say 'discourse', not 'talk'. Knowledge that is not accessible is not helpful. It becomes aerialised\u2014and I think it's important that women's experiences be given a narrative.\"[132]\n\nKinsey Reports[edit]\nIn addition to feminism, Steinem has also been a prominent advocate for analyzing the Kinsey Reports.[133][134]\n\nPornography[edit]\nSteinem has criticized pornography, which she distinguishes from erotica, writing: \"Erotica is as different from pornography as love is from rape, as dignity is from humiliation, as partnership is from slavery, as pleasure is from pain.\"[21]:\u200a219\u200a[135] Steinem's argument hinges on the distinction between reciprocity versus domination, as she writes, \"Blatant or subtle, pornography involves no equal power or mutuality. In fact, much of the tension and drama comes from the clear idea that one person is dominating the other.\"[21]:\u200a219\u200a[135]\nOn the issue of same-sex pornography, Steinem asserts, \"Whatever the gender of the participants, all pornography including male-male gay pornography is an imitation of the male-female, conqueror-victim paradigm, and almost all of it actually portrays or implies enslaved women and master.\"[21]:\u200a219\u200a[135] Steinem has also cited \"snuff films\" as a serious threat to women.[21]:\u200a219\u200a[135]\n\nSame-sex marriage[edit]\nIn an essay published in Time magazine on August 31, 1970, \"What Would It Be Like If Women Win\", Steinem wrote about same-sex marriage in the context of the \"Utopian\" future she envisioned, writing:\n\nWhat will exist is a variety of alternative life-styles. Since the population explosion dictates that childbearing be kept to a minimum, parents-and-children will be only one of many \"families\": couples, age groups, working groups, mixed communes, blood-related clans, class groups, creative groups. Single women will have the right to stay single without ridicule, without the attitudes now betrayed by \"spinster\" and \"bachelor.\" Lesbians or homosexuals will no longer be denied legally binding marriages, complete with mutual-support agreements and inheritance rights. Paradoxically, the number of homosexuals may get smaller. With fewer over-possessive mothers and fewer fathers who hold up an impossibly cruel or perfectionist idea of manhood, boys will be less likely to be denied or reject their identity as males.[136]\nAlthough Steinem did not mention or advocate same-sex marriage in any published works or interviews for more than three decades, she again expressed support for same-sex marriage in the early 2000s, stating in 2004 that \"[the] idea that sexuality is only okay if it ends in reproduction oppresses women\u2014whose health depends on separating sexuality from reproduction\u2014as well as gay men and lesbians.\"[137] Steinem is also a signatory of the 2008 manifesto, \"Beyond Same-Sex Marriage: A New Strategic Vision For All Our Families and Relationships\", which advocates extending legal rights and privileges to a wide range of relationships, households, and families.[138]\n\nTransgender rights[edit]\nIn 1977, Steinem expressed disapproval that the heavily publicized sex reassignment surgery of tennis player Ren\u00e9e Richards had been in her opinion characterized as either a frightening look at what feminism could cause or as proof that feminism was no longer necessary. Steinem wrote that the issue was at minimum \"a diversion from the widespread problems of sexual inequality.\" She also wrote that, while she supported the right of individuals to identify as they choose, she believed some transsexuals \"surgically mutilate their own bodies\" in order to conform to a gender role that is inexorably tied to physical body parts. She claimed that \"feminists are right to feel uncomfortable about the need for and uses of transsexualism.\"[21]:\u200a206\u2013210\u200a\nOn October 2, 2013, Steinem clarified her remarks on transgender people in an op-ed for The Advocate, writing that critics failed to consider that her 1977 essay was \"written in the context of global protests against routine surgical assaults, called female genital mutilation by some survivors.\"[139] Steinem later in the piece expressed unequivocal support for transgender people, saying that transgender people \"including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned.\"[139] She also apologized for any pain her words might have caused.[139]\nOn June 15, 2020, Steinem co-wrote a letter with Mona Sinha to the editor of The New York Times, in which they opposed the elimination of civil rights protections for transgender healthcare by the Trump administration. In it, they made note of precolonial American traditions of gender variance and claimed that \"the health of any of us affects the health of all of us, and excluding trans people endangers us all.\"[140]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\nMain article: List of awards received by Gloria Steinem\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Southern California's Bill of Rights Award[9]\nAmerican Humanist Association's 2012 Humanist of the Year (2012)[9]\nBBC's 100 Women list (2023).[141]\nBenjamin N.

(The actual name of the piece by Steinem being referred to here is \"A Bunny's Tale\".)\nIn 2011, Gloria: In Her Own Words, a documentary, first aired.[163]\nIn 2013, Female Force: Gloria Steinem, a comic book by Melissa Seymour, was published.[164][165][166]\nAlso in 2013, Steinem was featured in the documentary MAKERS: Women Who Make America about the feminist movement.[167]\nIn 2014, Who Is Gloria Steinem?, by Sarah Fabiny, was published.[168]\nAlso in 2014, Steinem appeared in season 1, episode 8, of the television show The Sixties.[169]\nAlso in 2014, Steinem appeared in season 6, episode 3, of the television show The Good Wife.[170]\nIn 2016, Steinem was featured in the catalog of clothing retailer Lands' End. After an outcry from anti-abortion customers, the company removed Steinem from their website, stating on their Facebook page: \"It was never our intention to raise a divisive political or religious issue, so when some of our customers saw the recent promotion that way, we heard them. We sincerely apologize for any offense.\"  The company then faced further criticism online, this time both from customers who were still unhappy that Steinem had been featured in the first place, and customers who were unhappy that Steinem had been removed.[171]\nIn Jennifer Lopez's 2016 music video for her song \"Ain't Your Mama\", Steinem can be heard saying part of her \"Address to the Women of America\" speech, specifically, \"This is no simple reform. It really is a revolution.\"[172][173]\nAlso in 2016, the television series Woman premiered, featuring Steinem as producer and host; it is a documentary series concerning sexist injustice and violence worldwide.[174]\nThe Gloria Steinem Papers are held in the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College, under collection number MS 237.[175]\nThe play Gloria: A Life, about Steinem's life, opened October 2018 at the Daryl Roth Theatre, directed by Diane Paulus.[176]\nThe Glorias is an American biographical film about Steinem which premiered in 2020.[177] In the film, she is played by four actresses who portray her life at various ages: Ryan Kiera Armstrong as a child, Lulu Wilson as a teen, Alicia Vikander between the ages of 20 and 40, and Julianne Moore as an older woman.\nIn 2020, Steinem was portrayed by Rose Byrne in the FX miniseries Mrs. America, depicting the movement to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).[178]\nIn 2023, she guest starred on the Season 2 episode ' Alive! of the MAX series And Just Like That...\n\nWorks[edit]\nThe Thousand Indias (1957)\nThe Beach Book (1963), New York: Viking Press.

He is the host of the late-night comedy talk show Gutfeld!,[1] and hosted a Saturday night edition of Gutfeld! called The Greg Gutfeld Show from May 2015 until March 2021, when it was announced the show would transition to weeknights. \nGutfeld is also one of five co-hosts and panelists on the political talk show The Five. Both of his shows air on the Fox News Channel. From 2007 to 2015, Gutfeld hosted the 3AM series Red Eye, a late-night talk show that also aired on the Fox News Channel.[2]\n\n\nEarly life and education\nGutfeld was born in San Mateo, California, the son of Jacqueline Bernice \"Jackie\" (n\u00e9e Cauhape) and Alfred Jack Gutfeld.[3] Raised Catholic, he attended the all-boys Roman Catholic Jun\u00edpero Serra High School[4] and the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in English.[5][6]\nIn a 2009 interview, Gutfeld explained that he started to experience a change in his political thinking while he was attending college:[7]\n\nI became a conservative by being around liberals, and I became a libertarian by being around conservatives. You realize that there's something distinctly in common between the two groups, the left and the right; the worst part of each of them is the moralizing.\nCareer\nAfter college, Gutfeld interned at The American Spectator, as an assistant to conservative writer R. Emmett Tyrrell. He then worked as a staff writer at Prevention magazine and as an editor for various Rodale Press magazines. In 1995, he became a staff writer at Men's Health. He was promoted to editor-in-chief of Men's Health in 1999. A year later, he was replaced by David Zinczenko.\nGutfeld then became editor-in-chief of Stuff, then owned by Dennis Publishing. During his tenure, circulation increased from 750,000 to 1.2 million. In 2003, Gutfeld hired several dwarfs to attend a conference of the Magazine Publishers of America on the topic of \"buzz\", with instructions to be as loud and annoying as possible.[8] The stunt generated publicity but led to Gutfeld being fired soon afterward; he then became \"director of brand development\" at Dennis Publishing.[8] He edited the company's Maxim magazine in the U.K. from 2004 to 2006.[6] Gutfeld's contract expired without renewal after losses in readership under his tenure.[9]\nGutfeld was one of the first posting contributors to The Huffington Post, from its launch in 2005 until October 2008. Frequent targets of his commentaries included Huffington Post colleagues Deepak Chopra, Cenk Uygur, and Arianna Huffington.[10]\n\nGutfeld speaking at Turning Point USA, 2018.\nBeginning on February 5, 2007, Gutfeld served as host of the late-night talk show Red Eye on the Fox News Channel. The hour-long show initially aired at 2:00 A.M. ET Monday through Saturday mornings and at 11:00 P.M. on Saturday evenings. However, beginning in October 2007, the show began airing at 3:00 A.M. Monday through Saturday mornings while retaining its 11:00 P.M timeslot on Saturday evenings. From 2007 to 2013, Bill Schulz served as Gutfeld's sidekick, and Andy Levy served as the show's ombudsman. Schulz had been Gutfeld's colleague at Stuff magazine, and Levy was a fellow blogger at The Huffington Post. On July 11, 2011, Gutfeld became a co-host and panelist on the Fox News political talk show The Five, which airs weekdays at 5:00 P.M. ET.[11] Gutfeld left Red Eye in February 2015, with Tom Shillue succeeding him as host of the program.[12] On May 31, 2015, Gutfeld began hosting a new weekly late-night talk show on Fox News called The Greg Gutfeld Show; which aired at 10:00 P.M. ET on Saturdays. In February 2021, it was announced that, beginning in the second quarter, the show would move to weeknights at 11:00 P.M. ET.[13] On March 10, 2021, it was announced that the new weeknight show would be called Gutfeld! and premiere on April 5.[14] In August 2021, Gutfeld!  overtook The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in the nightly ratings, becoming the highest-rated late-night talk show in the United States. It averaged 2.12 million nightly viewers, more than The Late Show, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and Jimmy Kimmel Live!.[15]\nBy the end of 2021, the combined viewership for Gutfeld! and The Five averaged over five million viewers.[16]\nGutfeld has appeared as a guest on Coffee with Scott Adams[17][18] and The Adam Carolla Show.[19]\n\nRecognition\nIn late 2021, Gutfeld was named the 12th-most influential person in American media by the Mediaite website.[16]\n\nControversies\nApology to Canadians\nDuring a Red Eye segment that aired on March 17, 2009, Gutfeld and his panel discussed Canadian Lieutenant General Andrew Leslie's statement that the Canadian Armed Forces may require a one-year \"synchronized break\" once Canada's mission in Afghanistan ended in 2011: \"Meaning, the Canadian military wants to take a breather to do some yoga, paint landscapes, run on the beach in gorgeous white Capri pants.\"[20] The comedian panelist Doug Benson added: \"I didn't even know they were in the war.... I thought that's where you go if you don't want to fight. Go chill in Canada.\"[20] Gutfeld also said: \"Isn't this the perfect time to invade this ridiculous country? They have no army!\"[20]\nThe segment was posted to YouTube three days after the reported deaths of four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan, prompting widespread outrage.[21][22][23] Canada had then been in command of the NATO mission in Kandahar Province, the birthplace and former capital of the Taliban, for three years.[24] Along with Helmand Province, it was \"home to some of the fiercest opposition to coalition forces\" and reported to \"have the highest casualty rates per province.\"[25]\nCanadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay called on Fox to apologize for the comments and described the remarks as \"despicable, hurtful and ignorant.\"[26] Gutfeld, while maintaining that the show is satirical and irreverent, offered the following apology: \"The March 17 episode of Red Eye included a segment discussing Canada's plan for a 'synchronized break,' which was in no way an attempt to make light of troop efforts. However, I realize that my words may have been misunderstood. It was not my intent to disrespect the brave men, women, and families of the Canadian military, and for that, I apologize.\"[26][27]\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Gutfeld said that the media were emotionally manipulating viewers with footage from the conflict \"...because that makes a profit for news companies.\"[28][29] Gutfeld was rebuked by Fox News foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall who was on the ground in Kyiv: \"This is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response. This is absolutely what\u2019s happening.\"[28][29] A few days later, Hall was seriously injured, while Pierre Zakrzewski (who also works for Fox) and a Ukrainian journalist were killed, in a surprise attack on the journalists by Russian forces.[30] Gutfeld's mother-in-law, the mother of Elena Gutfeld, was also evacuated from Ukraine due to the efforts of Fox News colleagues Steve Brannigan and Lucas Tomlinson.[31]\n\nComments on the Holocaust\nDuring the July 24, 2023, broadcast of The Five, Gutfeld and co-host Jessica Tarlov discussed an educational curriculum in Florida public schools that would teach students that \"slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit\".[32] Tarlov, who said she is Jewish, disagreed with the curriculum and asked if this could be argued for those who perished in the Holocaust. Gutfeld then invoked Viktor Frankl's book Man's Search For Meaning, implying that those who survived the Holocaust had to be skilled or useful.[32]\nOn July 25, the Auschwitz Memorial disagreed with Gutfeld's statement, writing on Twitter: \"While it is true that some Jews may have used their skills or usefulness to increase their chances of survival during the Holocaust, it is essential to contextualize this statement properly and understand that it does not represent the complex history of the genocide perpetrated by Nazi Germany.\"[33] The same day, Andrew Bates, deputy White House press secretary, called Gutfeld's comments \"a horrid, dangerous, extreme lie that insults the memory of the millions of Americans who suffered from the evil of enslavement\".[34] The Daily Beast also reported that unnamed Fox News employees strongly disagreed with Gutfeld's statements. One producer stated it was \"a disgusting thing to say\" while another insider claimed \"his career would be over.\"[35] [36]\n\nPersonal life\nGutfeld said that he voted by mail in the 2016 presidential election, but The Washington Post could find no evidence in voting records. Gutfeld thinks it is possible that he missed the official deadline.[16]\nAs of 2018[update], Gutfeld resides in New York City with his Russian wife, Elena Moussa. He met the photo editor in London, where he lived for three years.[7][37][16]\nGutfeld was raised Roman Catholic and served as an altar boy.[38] He describes himself as an \"agnostic atheist\".[37]\nA fan of hard rock and heavy metal music, Gutfeld has spoken on-air about being a fan of many bands, including Power Trip. Gutfeld paid tribute to Power Trip's singer Riley Gale after his death in 2020.[39] Members of the heavy band GWAR have appeared several times on his show.[40]\nGutfeld is also a self-described libertarian.[41]\n\nBooks\nGutfeld at a book signing for his book Not Cool (March 2014)\nThe Scorecard: The Official Point System for Keeping Score in the Relationship Game.
