Based in Los Angeles, California, it is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization. According to its website, the foundation is committed to advancing \"the values of individual freedom and choice, limited government, and market-friendly policies.\" In the 2014 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), the foundation was number 41 (of 60) in the \"Top Think Tanks in the United States\".[5]\nReason Foundation's policy research areas include: air traffic control, American domestic monetary policy, school choice, eminent domain, government reform, housing, land use, immigration, privatization, public\u2013private partnerships, urban traffic and congestion, transportation, industrial hemp, medical marijuana, police raids and militarization, free trade, globalization, and telecommunications.[6] Affiliated projects include Drew Carey's Reason TV video website. Reason Foundation staff also regularly contribute to the Out of Control Policy Blog.\nReason Foundation cofounder Robert Poole is an MIT-trained engineer and the author of Cutting Back City Hall.[7] The book provided the intellectual support for Margaret Thatcher's privatization efforts in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.[8] Poole remains at Reason serving as an officer on the organization's board of trustees and director of transportation. He founded Reason magazine with Manny Klausner and Tibor Machan.[7]\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nRobert Poole founded Reason Foundation and served as its president from 1978 to 2001.[1] Patricia Lynn Scarlett took over as president in 2001, but soon resigned to join the George W. Bush administration as assistant secretary for policy, management, and budget at the Department of the Interior.[citation needed] David Nott, a Stanford University graduate, has served as Reason Foundation's president since 2001.[1]\nThe foundation is an associate member of the State Policy Network, a U.S. national network of free-market-oriented think tanks.[9]\n\nFunding and partners[edit]\nAs a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Reason Foundation is supported by donations and sale of its publications.[1] According to 2012 disclosures,[4] its largest donors were the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation ($1,522,212) and the Sarah Scaife Foundation ($2,016,000).\nIn 2020, the independent rating group Charity Navigator rated Reason with four out of four stars.[10][11]\n\nPublications[edit]\nPart of a series onLibertarianism\nConcepts\nAbstention\nAge of consent reform\nAnti-authoritarianism\nAnti-capitalism\nAntimilitarism\nAnti-statism\nClass struggle\nCounter-economics\nCrypto-anarchism\nDecentralization\nDeparturism\nDirect action\nEconomic freedom\nEgalitarianism\nEvictionism\nExpropriative anarchism\nFederalism (anarchist)\nFree association (Marxism and anarchism)\nFree love\nFree market\nFree-market environmentalism\nFree migration\nFree trade\nFreedom of association\nFreedom of contract\nGift economy\nHomestead principle\nIllegalism\nIndividualism\nIndividual reclamation\nLiberty\nLibertarianism (metaphysics)\nLocalism\nNatural law\nNatural rights and legal rights\nNight-watchman state\nNon-aggression principle\nParticipatory economics\nPropaganda of the deed\nProperty is theft!\nRefusal of work\nSelf-governance\nSelf-ownership\nSingle tax\nSocial ecology\nSpontaneous order\nSquatting\nStateless society\nTax resistance\nVoluntary society\nWorkers' councils\nWorkers' self-management\n\nIssues\nAbortion\nAffirmative action\nAnarcho-capitalism and minarchism\nCapital punishment\nCriticism\nForeign intervention\nImmigration\nIntellectual property\nInternal debates\nLGBT rights\nObjectivism\nPolitical alliances\nPolitical parties\nTheories of law\n\nPhilosophers\nLa Bo\u00e9tie\nPaine\nBentham\nGodwin\nHodgskin\nWarren\nEmerson\nStirner\nSpooner\nProudhon\nAndrews\nBakunin\nThoreau\nSpencer\nHerbert\nGeorge\nDe Cleyre\nGoldman\nGandhi\nMises\nPaterson\nHayek\nRand\nFriedman (Milton)\nBookchin\nHess\nRothbard\nChomsky\nNozick\nMachan\nBlock\nFriedman (David)\nKonkin\nHoppe\nHuemer\nBrennan\n\nPoliticians\nBastiat\nGladstone\nActon\nCleveland\nCoolidge\nGoldwater\nPaul\nKorwin-Mikke\nJohnson\nMilei\nHannan\n\nNational variants\nSouth Africa\nSpain\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\n\nHistorical background\nAge of Enlightenment\nAnarchism\nAristotelianism\nLiberalism\nclassical\nradical\n\nRelated topics\nAbolitionism\nAnti-collectivism\nAnti-communism\nAnti-fascism\nAnti-socialism\nAustro-libertarianism\nCenter for Libertarian Studies\nCivil libertarianism\nClassical liberalism\nConstitutionalism\nEconomic liberalism\nFreeman on the land movement\nFusionism\nGreen libertarianism\nLibertarian conservatism\nLibertarian Democrats\nLibertarian socialism\nLibertarian Republicans\nLibertarian science fiction\nLibertarianism in South Africa\nLibertarianism in the United Kingdom\nLibertarianism in the United States\nObjectivism\nPublic choice theory\nSmall government\nSovereign citizen movement\nTechnolibertarianism\n\n\u00a0Libertarianism portal\n\u00a0Anarchism portal\n\u00a0Politics portalvte\nAnnual Privatization Report, Privatization Watch, and Innovators in Action[edit]\nReason Foundation publishes the Annual Privatization Report, which reports on news and trends in U.S. outsourcing, privatization, and public-private partnerships. Privatization Watch is another of the Foundation's privatization publications published quarterly. Innovators in Action is an annual publication that advocates shrinking the size and scope of government, usually through privatization. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Colorado Gov. Bill Owens wrote columns for this publication in 2007.[citation needed]\n\nAnnual Highway Report[edit]\nReason Foundation's Annual Highway Report ranks each state's transportation system on cost-effectiveness and efficiency.[12]\n\nReason magazine[edit]\nMain article: Reason (magazine)\nReason Foundation's primary publication is the magazine, Reason, which was first published in 1968 by Lanny Friedlander,[1] and was originally an infrequently published mimeographed magazine. In 1970, Robert Poole purchased Reason with Manuel S. Klausner and Tibor R. Machan, who set the magazine on a more regular publication schedule.[13] The magazine covers politics, culture, and ideas through a mix of news, analysis, commentary, and reviews.\nReason and Reason Online are editorially-independent publications of the foundation.[14] Reason magazine won three Los Angeles Press Club awards in 2008.[15]\n\nPolicy areas[edit]\nPrivatization[edit]\nReason Foundation cofounder Robert Poole \"is credited as the first person to use the term 'privatization' to refer to the contracting-out of public services and is the author of the first-ever book on municipal privatization, Cutting Back City Hall, published by Universe Books in 1980.\"[7] The book was very influential, notably, by providing the intellectual support for Margaret Thatcher's privatization efforts in the United Kingdom.[8] Thatcher wrote in the foundation's Annual Privatization Report 2006, \"State control is fundamentally bad because it denies people the power to choose and the opportunity to bear responsibility for their own actions. Conversely, privatisation shrinks the power of the state and free enterprise enlarges the power of the people.\"[16]\nThe Reason Foundation supports the privatization of (or public-private partnerships for) almost all government functions. Leonard Gilroy, Reason Foundation's director of government reform, describes privatization as \"a strategy to lower the costs of government and achieve higher performance and better outcomes for tax dollars spent.\"[17] Gilroy also notes that \"If badly executed, privatization like any other policy can fail. Taxpayers are no better off, and may be worse off, if a service is moved from a government agency to an incompetent or inefficient private business.\"[17]\n\nTransportation[edit]\nReason is engaged in several transportation policy endeavors. (Foundation cofounder Robert Poole serves as the director of transportation policy.[as of?]) According to the New York Times, \"[f]or 17 years, Mr. Poole has been the chief theorist for private solutions to gridlock. His ideas are now embraced by officials from Sacramento to Washington.\"[18]\nThe Galvin Mobility Project has led to the production of studies on the causes of congestion, such as the book \"Mobility First: A New Vision for Transportation in a Globally Competitive Twenty-First Century\" by Reason Foundation's director of urban growth and land use policy, Sam Staley.\n\nEducation[edit]\nReason Foundation advocates for education reform through expanded school choice initiatives. Reason's director of education and child welfare, Lisa Snell, authored a study in 2009 entitled Weighted Student Formula Yearbook 2009, which examined school districts using student-based \"backpack funding.\"[19] Snell is also: \"an advisory board member to the National Quality Improvement Center for the Children\u2019s Bureau; on the charter school accreditation team for the American Academy for Liberal Education; and serves as a board member for the California Virtual Academy.\"[20]\n\nMunicipal broadband[edit]\nIn 2006, Reason Foundation issued a report criticizing a municipal Wi-Fi project iProvo in Provo, Utah as financially unstable and ineffective at lowering Internet costs or raising broadband use.[21] iProvo proponents responded vigorously with a white paper rebutting Reason's conclusions.[22]\nIn 2008, Reason issued a follow-up report entitled, iProvo Revisited: Another Year and Still Struggling. According to Reason, the predictions in its first report had proven true: \"iProvo's total losses are likely to exceed $10 million by the end of this fiscal year \u2013 and that figure doesn't include the $39.5 million borrowed to launch the project, most of which still needs to be paid back.\"[23] Reason called for the city to \"cut its losses\" and sell the network to a private company. Shortly after the 2008 report was issued, the mayor of Provo, Lewis Billings, who had been highly critical of the Reason reports, announced that iProvo would in fact be sold to a private enterprise, Broadweave, for $40 million.[24]\n\nClimate change[edit]\nIn 2005, Reason magazine's science writer Ronald Bailey wrote a column declaring that climate change is both real and anthropogenic. He wrote, \"Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up. All data sets \u2013 satellite, surface, and balloon \u2013 have been pointing to rising global temperatures.\"[25]\nIn 2006, Bailey wrote an article entitled \"Confessions of an Alleged ExxonMobil Whore: Actually no one paid me to be wrong about global warming. Or anything else.\"[26] In the article Bailey explains how increasing public rebuff changed his mind on climate change.\n\nWar in Iraq[edit]\nThe Reason Foundation was critical of the cost of the war in Iraq. Reason magazine's May 2008 cover story, \"Trillion Dollar War\",[27] discussed what it viewed as the dubious ways in which the war in Iraq and Afghanistan have been funded by Congress, the military\u2013industrial complex, and the Bush administration.\n\nHealth care[edit]\nOn August 25, 2010, ReasonTV published a video entitled, \"Wheat, Weed and Obamacare: How the Commerce Clause Made Congress All-Powerful\", as part of an effort to question the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), also known as Obamacare.[4] The video has been credited with popularizing the argument in conservative circles that PPACA's individual mandate to buy health insurance is constitutionally equivalent to requiring consumers to buy particular types of fruits or vegetables.[4] This argument was ultimately articulated by Justice Antonin Scalia, who suggested during oral argument of the PPACA cases that if Congress has the power to require Americans to buy health insurance, then \"Therefore, you can make people buy broccoli.\"[4]\n\nBastiat Prize[edit]\nReason Foundation issued an annual Bastiat Prize (named after Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat) to recognize writing that \u201cbest demonstrates the importance of freedom with originality, wit and eloquence\u201d. Awardees include Bari Weiss, Radley Balko, Daniel Hannan, Robert Graboyes, Ross Clark, Virginia Postrel, Tom Easton, Bret Stephens, Amit Varma, Jamie Whyte, Tim Harford, Robert Guest, Brian Carney, and Amity Shlaes.[28]\n\nDrew Carey Project and Reason TV[edit]\nComedian and The Price Is Right host Drew Carey serves on the board of trustees at Reason Foundation. According to an interview by Katherine Herrup of The New York Sun with Nick Gillespie (current editor-in-chief of Reason TV), Carey initially proposed the idea for Reason TV after reading Reason magazine for years. He then both appeared in and narrated many videos produced by Reason TV.[29]\nOne of the collaboration's first projects, Carey's video criticizing the Drug Enforcement Administration's medical marijuana raids, received significant national attention,[30] Some of his other videos for the foundation have promoted free trade; criticized the government's raids of local poker games and an Arizona attempt to ban dancing in a family restaurant (Footloose in Arizona);[31] highlighted a ban on bacon-wrapped hot dogs in Los Angeles; detailed abuse of eminent domain laws; called for more toll roads to relieve congestion; argued for deregulation of organ donation (including kidneys and other organs); and called for immigration reform.[32]\nReason TV produced a full-length documentary entitled Reason Saves Cleveland with Drew Carey applying success stories from around the United States to \"save Cleveland.\" The documentary was awarded \"Best Advocacy Journalism\" at the 53rd Annual Southern California Journalism Awards by the Los Angeles Press Club.[33]\n\nOath of Presidential Transparency[edit]\nReason Foundation and a bipartisan group of more than thirty other organizations asked all of the 2008 U.S. presidential candidates to sign a pledge promising that, if elected, they would deliver the most transparent presidency in history and guaranteeing the executive branch would adhere to the concepts of open government. The candidates who signed the oath were: Sen. Barack Obama (D\u2013Illinois), Rep. Ron Paul (R\u2013Texas), Sen. Sam Brownback (R\u2013Kansas), former Sen. Mike Gravel (D\u2013Alaska), Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D\u2013Ohio), Libertarian candidate Bob Barr, and John Cox.\nReason Foundation's vice president of research Adrian Moore said of the oath, \"The next president should be committed to transparency and accountability. Redesigning the federal government, so that it is more accountable to taxpayers and businesses, is a nonpartisan issue. Transparency will help produce a government focused on results instead of our current system, which is plagued by secrecy, wasteful spending and pork projects.\"[34]\nThen-Senator Barack Obama echoed those sentiments saying, \"Every American has the right to know how the government spends their tax dollars, but for too long that information has been largely hidden from public view. This historic law will lift the veil of secrecy in Washington and ensure that our government is transparent and accountable to the American people.\"[34]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f \"About the Reason Foundation\".

Lowry became editor of National Review in 1997 when selected by its founder, William F. Buckley, Jr., to lead the magazine. Lowry is also a syndicated columnist, author, and political analyst who is a frequent guest on NBC News and Meet the Press. He has written four books.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nLowry was born and grew up in Arlington, Virginia, the son of a social worker mother and an English professor father.[1][2][3][4] After graduating from Yorktown High School in Arlington, Lowry attended the University of Virginia, where he studied English and history.[5] He was editor of the Virginia Advocate, the school's conservative monthly magazine.\n\nCareer[edit]\nAfter graduating, Lowry worked for Charles Krauthammer as a research assistant, and, later, as a reporter for a local newspaper in northern Virginia.[5]\nIn 1992, Lowry joined National Review, after finishing second in the magazine's young writers' contest. In the summer of 1994, he became the articles editor for National Review and moved to Washington, D.C. to cover Congress.[5] In November 1997, Lowry became editor of National Review at the age of 29, taking over from John O'Sullivan, who had succeeded Buckley in that position ten years earlier.[6] At the time, Buckley said of Lowry, \"I am very confident that I've got a very good person.\"[6]\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Lowry praised Florida governor Ron DeSantis for his hands-off approach to COVID-19 in a May 2020 column titled \"Where does Ron DeSantis go to get his apology?\".[7][8]\nLowry writes a syndicated column for King Features and an opinion column for Politico.\nAs a political commentator, he regularly appears on various cable shows and network Sunday shows, including NBC's Meet the Press, ABC's This Week, and FOX News Sunday.\n\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Lowry on Legacy, November 9, 2003, C-SPAN Presentation by Lowry on Lincoln Unbound, June 18, 2013, C-SPAN Presentation by Lowry on Lincoln Unbound, March 22, 2014, C-SPAN Presentation by Lowry on The Case for Nationalism, November 18, 2019, C-SPAN Washington Journal interview with Lowry on The Case for Nationalism, December 29, 2019, C-SPAN\nBooks[edit]\nLowry has written three non-fiction books. His New York Times best-selling book, Legacy: Paying the Price for the Clinton Years[9] is a polemic against former President Bill Clinton, whom he characterizes as \"Navel-Gazer-in-Chief\".[10] In June 2013, he published the Abraham Lincoln political biography Lincoln Unbound.[11]\n\nLowry with then United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at a 2019 National Review Institute summit\nIn November 2019, he published The Case for Nationalism: How It Made Us Powerful, United, and Free.[12] In a review in Foreign Affairs, Georgetown University Professor of Government, Charles King, criticized the book, arguing that Lowry's definition of a nation is vague, ahistorical and contradictory: \"few of Lowry's statements would pass muster with historians\", and that Lowry's assertions about the unity, homogeneity and fixity of units such as Ancient Egypt, Korea, Japan and China \"should be an embarrassment\" to \"any serious thinker.\"[13] Pulitzer Prize winner Carlos Lozada was harshly critical of the book in a review for The Washington Post, describing it as an attempt to sanitize President Donald Trump's variant of nationalism and \"part of a larger effort on the right to create an after-the-fact framework for Trumpism, to contort the president's utterances and impulses into a coherent worldview that can outlast him \u2014 a sort of rescue mission for the conservative movement.\"[14]\nLowry's first novel, the political thriller Banquo's Ghosts, was co-written with Keith Korman and published in 2009.[15]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn June 2011, Lowry married Vanessa Palo at the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in Manhattan.[16]\n\nWorks[edit]\nLowry, Rich (2003).

He was chairman of the board of Gateway from 2005 to 2007, a co-founder of Ardesta, LLC, a venture capital firm, HealthMedia, Inc., a digital health coaching company, and is currently CEO of SensCy,[1] a cybersecurity company based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[2]\nA member of the Republican Party,[3] he won the 2010 Michigan gubernatorial election and won reelection in 2014.[4] Snyder was term-limited and could not seek re-election in 2018 and was succeeded by Democrat Gretchen Whitmer. Snyder was considered a possible Republican Party candidate for Vice President of the United States in 2012, although ultimately Paul Ryan was selected.[5][6][7][8]\nIn 2014, Snyder gained national attention during the Flint water crisis, in which he was accused of mishandling the situation that exposed thousands of Flint residents to lead-contaminated water. A report by the University of Michigan School of Public Health concluded Snyder bore \"significant legal responsibility\" for the Flint water crisis.[9] In 2020, an article was published in Vice detailing evidence of corruption and a cover-up by Snyder, including that he was warned repeatedly about the dangerous effects of the decisions he had made about the Flint water supply.[10] In January 2021, Snyder was among those criminally charged for the crisis.[11] He pled not guilty to two misdemeanor charges.[12][13][14] In December 2022 Genesee County Judge F. Kay Behm dismissed the charges.[15]\n\n\nEarly life, education, and family[edit]\nSnyder was born to Dale F. and Helen Louella Snyder in Battle Creek, Michigan, where he was raised. His father owned a local window-cleaning company in Battle Creek, and was of paternal Dutch descent.[16] He has an elder sister.[17] When he was 16, he took a business class at Kellogg Community College on weekends. By his senior year at Lakeview High School in Calhoun County, Snyder had earned 23 college credits.[18]\nSnyder visited the admissions office of the University of Michigan in November 1975 and spoke with the admissions director, who recommended that Snyder attend Michigan and create his own degree.[19] Snyder received a Bachelor of General Studies in 1977, a Master of Business Administration in 1979, and a Juris Doctor in 1982, all from the University of Michigan.[20][21] Snyder is also a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).[22]\nHe resides in Ann Arbor, Michigan with his wife Sue and their three children and has a vacation home near Gun Lake.[23] The couple were married in 1987 at Cherry Hill Presbyterian Church in Dearborn, Michigan.[24] Snyder has indicated he is a practicing Presbyterian.[24]\n\nMichigan Governor Rick Snyder with First Lady Sue Snyder, at Ford Field in Detroit, January 18, 2013\nBusiness career[edit]\nCoopers & Lybrand[edit]\nSnyder was employed with Coopers & Lybrand, from 1982 to 1991, beginning in the tax department of the Detroit office. Snyder was named partner in 1988. The next year, Snyder was named partner-in-charge of the mergers and acquisitions practice in the Chicago office.[25] He served as an adjunct assistant professor of accounting at the University of Michigan from 1982 to 1984.[26]\n\nGateway, Inc.[edit]\nSnyder joined the computer company Gateway (based in Irvine, California) in 1991 as the executive vice president. He served as president and chief operating officer from 1996 to 1997. He remained on the board of directors until 2007.[27] From 2005 to 2007, Snyder served as the chairman of the board. During 2006, Snyder served as interim chief executive officer while a search for a permanent replacement was made. His tenure on the Gateway board ran from 1991 to 2007 until Gateway was sold to Acer Inc. Snyder stated that he did not vote for outsourcing while he was a Gateway board director and he worked to bring jobs to America as the interim CEO of Gateway.[28]\n\nVenture Capital / Investments[edit]\nIn 1997, Snyder returned to Ann Arbor to found Avalon Investments Inc., a venture capital company with a $100 million fund, along with the co-founder of Gateway, Ted Waitt. Snyder was president and chief executive officer of Avalon from 1997 to 2000. He then co-founded Ardesta LLC, an investment firm, in 2000 along with three co-founders, which invested in 20 start-up companies through 2011. He was chairman and chief executive officer of the company.\n\nHealthMedia, Inc.[edit]\nThis section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. The specific problem is: Reference formatting and run-on sentences. Please help improve this section if you can. (October 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nIn 1998, Snyder angel funded and co-founded, with University of Michigan (U-M) School of Public Health professor Victor Strecher, Ph.D., HealthMedia Incorporated (HMI), a developer of digital health coaching applications that implemented tailored questionnaires to gather personal information with the goal of creating customized health promotion plans for individuals. The U-M's Office of Technology Transfer played an integral role in helping HMI get started with Vic Strecher as the founding CEO and the U-M's publicly funded Health Media Research Laboratory (founded and directed by Strecher and now called the Center for Health Communications Research) providing the new company with exclusive research and development findings into health-related computerized tailored messaging and the exclusive licence to sell that content (UM spawns spinoffs, patents). Despite these university-based start-up and R&D advantages, HMI got off to a poor performance start and in 2001 Snyder replaced the founding CEO (Strecher remained on the HMI board) and personally rescued the company from insolvency with more of his own money. After multiple rounds of more additional financing through venture capital (Arboretum Ventures, Ardesta, Avalon Capital Group, AvTech Ventures, Chrysalis Ventures, Princeton Fund) and yet never achieving profitability, HMI was sold in 2008 for a reported $200 million to Johnson & Johnson. The sale of HMI transferred the ownership of all the personal health information accrued from their millions of users to Johnson & Johnson and played a key role in the negotiated price. At the time of the reported $200 million deal, U-M President Mary Sue Coleman was on Johnson & Johnson's board of directors and the U-M secured millions of dollars with its equity stake in the company.[29]   When campaigning for Michigan governor in 2010, Snyder was quoted as saying, \"That company (HMI) is one of the best success stories in the state.\" (Office of Technology Transfer \u2013 University of Michigan) (The Ann Arbor Chronicle | Live at PJ\u2019s: It\u2019s HealthMedia!). Following Snyder's election as Michigan governor, Johnson & Johnson then folded HMI into a subsidiary (Johnson & Johnson Health and Wellness Solutions) and is no longer operating in the state of Michigan.[30][31]\n\nSensCy, Inc.[edit]\nIn July, 2022, Snyder co-founded SensCy along with former State of Michigan CIO David Behen[32] Ann Arbor entrepreneur Bhushan Kulkarni,[33] and Dave Kelly[34] who led cyber command for the Michigan State Police. SensCy is a cybersecurity start-up focused on helping small and medium-sized organizations improve their cyberhealth. Snyder's firm invented the SensCy Score,[35] a numeric representation of an organization's cyberhealth. The SensCy Score is similar to the FICO score used for credit worthiness as it provides visibility into how a company is performing on key cybersecurity metrics. SensCy stands for Sensible Cyber and aims to be the trusted guide for small and medium-sized organizations.\n\nNon-profit service[edit]\nSnyder serves on the boards of the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village (a National Historic Landmark), the Michigan chapter of the Nature Conservancy, and several boards associated with his alma mater the University of Michigan. He was also first chair of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation in 1999 under Republican governor John Engler and was also the chair of Ann Arbor SPARK.\n\nGubernatorial elections[edit]\n2010[edit]\nMain article: 2010 Michigan gubernatorial election\nRick Snyder in 2009\nSnyder competed with Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard, state Senator Tom George, United States Congressman Peter Hoekstra, and Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox as candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Bill Ford Jr., chairman of the Ford Motor Company, endorsed Snyder for the Republican nomination for governor.[36][37] He campaigned as \"pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, [and] pro-family,\" with a focus on the economy.[21] His campaign emphasized his experience in growing business and creating jobs in the private sector, saying that his opponents were mainly career politicians. Snyder favors the standard exceptions on abortion for rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother (he signed legislation banning partial birth abortion in October 2011); he opposes federal funding of abortions; he would not ban embryonic stem cell research; he supports upholding traditional marriage, but would allow civil unions.[38][39]\nIn August 2010, Snyder won the primary to secure the Republican nomination with a plurality of 36% of the vote. In the general election in November, Snyder faced Democratic nominee Virg Bernero, the mayor of Lansing, and three minor party candidates. In October 2010, Snyder's campaign total exceeded $11.6 million, outpacing his opponent.[40] Snyder released his tax returns for 2007 and 2008.[41] Snyder won with 58 percent of the vote.[42]\nWith Snyder's election in 2010, Republicans gained a majority in the Michigan House and increased the Republican majority held in the Michigan Senate. Snyder was the first Certified Public Accountant (CPA) to be elected governor of the state and at the time, the only CPA to serve as a governor in the United States.[43]\n\n2014[edit]\nMain article: 2014 Michigan gubernatorial election\nIn January 2014, Snyder launched his campaign for a second term as governor.[44][45] He was unopposed in the Republican primary and faced Democratic former United States Representative Mark Schauer for the general election.[46] Snyder was considered vulnerable in his bid for a second term, as reflected in his low approval ratings,[47][48][49][50] however, Schauer suffered from a lack of name recognition.[51][52] He garnered approximately 51% of the vote in the November 2014 election, defeating Schauer and earning a second term.[4]\n\nGovernor of Michigan[edit]\nTenure[edit]\nThis article is in list format but may read better as prose.

(October 2022)\nGovernor Snyder takes the oath from Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Marilyn Kelly\nSnyder (far right) with (from left to right) United States Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides, United States Ambassador to Canada David Jacobson, Canadian Minister of State for Science and Technology Gary Goodyear, Governor General of Canada David Johnston, and Canada 2020 Chair Don Newman at the US\u2013Canada Partnership: Enhancing the Innovation Ecosystem conference at the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier in Ottawa, Ontario, November 2, 2011.\nSnyder was inaugurated as governor on January 1, 2011, at the Capitol in Lansing. His first executive order as governor was to divide the Department of Natural Resources and Environment into two distinct departments as they were a few years before: the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environmental Quality.[53][54]\nOn January 7, 2011, Snyder announced he was appointing Michigan Supreme Court Justice Maura D. Corrigan to head the Department of Human Services and appointed Michigan Appeals Court Judge Brian K. Zahra to fill the resulting Supreme Court vacancy. Snyder delivered his first State of the State address on January 19, the earliest Michigan State of the State since Governor John Engler's 1996 address on January 17. He endorsed the Detroit River International Crossing for the first time publicly in the address, which was received favorably by Republicans.[55] Snyder appointed Andy Dillon, a pro-life Democrat,[56] and formerly Speaker of the House, to serve as state treasurer in his administration.\nSnyder presented his first budget to the legislature on February 17, 2011,[57] calling it a plan for \"Michigan's reinvention,\" and saying it would end Michigan's deficits. He described the budget as containing \"shared sacrifice\" but added that his budget plan would create jobs and spur economic growth. The $46 billion budget reduced $1.8 billion in spending, raised taxes by eliminating tax exemptions on pensions, while at the same time abolished the state's complex business tax, replacing it with a significantly reduced flat tax on the profits of C corporations. This shift in tax burden led State Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer to criticize the budget, saying that it did not involve \"shared sacrifice,\" but instead was balanced \"on the backs of our kids, working families, and our seniors\" and \"picks out who he's willing to leave behind.\"[58] Snyder supported the government backed rescue of the American auto industry. This reflected the view of a 56% of Americans in 2012 who supported the 2009 auto bailout according to a Pew Research Center poll (63% support in Michigan).[59]\nOn March 16, 2011, Snyder signed a controversial bill into law that gave increased powers to emergency managers of local municipalities to resolve financial matters.[60] The bill was repealed by voter initiative in November 2012. However, weeks later in December 2012 Snyder signed a revised version of the bill back into law.[61]\nOn December 22, 2011, Snyder signed into law The Public Employee Domestic Partner Benefit Restriction Act, which prevents the same-sex domestic partners of public employees at both the state and local level from receiving health benefits. In January 2012, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Snyder and the state of Michigan in federal court on behalf of five Michigan same-sex couples, each with one spouse working for local public schools or municipalities in Michigan. The suit alleged that the law violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.[62][63] On June 28, 2013, a federal judge struck down the law.[64] He has also engaged in trade missions to Europe and Asia, focused on attracting attention on companies such as Chrysler.[65]\nFollowing approval from the legislature, Snyder signed the fiscal year 2012 budget in June, the earliest it had been completed in three decades.[66] In May 2012, Snyder joined a bipartisan effort urging the U.S. Congress to pass a measure to affirm that States can collect sales taxes on online purchases.[67][68]\nAs governor, Snyder abolished the state's complex business tax in favor of a flat tax, and signed a bill which raised taxes by eliminating tax exemptions for pensions. For years Snyder had said anti-union legislation was not on his agenda, when on the morning of December 6, 2012, during a lame duck session of the Republican-controlled Michigan legislature, Snyder called a joint press conference with the legislative leadership to announce fast-track right-to-work legislation. The legislation passed both houses of the Michigan legislature that day, without committee votes or public hearings. A $1 million appropriation added to the legislation made it ineligible for repeal via referendum.[69] On December 10, President Barack Obama visited Daimler AG's Detroit Diesel factory in Redford, Michigan, and told employees the legislation was about the \"right to work for less money.\"[70][71] The law effectively provides that payment of union dues cannot be required as a condition of employment.[72] After a required four-day wait between the houses of the legislature passing each other's bills,[73] Snyder signed the legislation into law on December 11, 2012, making Michigan the 24th right-to-work state in the United States as part of a plan to attract business and jobs to the state.[74][75][76] The Employee Free Choice Act, as it was named, has received mixed results in polls.[77]\nA Market Research Group poll conducted in March 2012 showed Snyder's approval rating rising to 50% among likely voters, which matched that of President Barack Obama, placing Snyder among the most popular Republican governors in states carried by Obama in the 2008 election cycle.[78] Snyder was briefly mentioned as a possible pick to be the Republican Party candidate for Vice President of the United States in 2012.[5][6][79] His business executive background and 'positive' style were cited as political assets, with his deeds seen as strengthening the case for electing a business executive candidate as President of the United States.[80][81][82] He was also mentioned as a potential Republican Party candidate for President of the United States in 2016.[83][84][85][86]\nIn December 2012, Snyder signed legislation requiring facilities where at least 120 abortions were performed annually to obtain a state license as freestanding surgical facilities.[87] Planned Parenthood had urged Snyder to veto the bill claiming it unnecessarily increases costs.[88]\nIn January 2013, Snyder traveled to Israel to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He was last in Israel in 1999 as a venture capitalist. \"I had a chance to see the start of high-tech boom in Israel and that's great to see. This is really a startup nation. They've done a great job of being entrepreneurial, innovative, and that's a major part of their economy now and the good part is we can learn from that.\"[89]\nIn March 2013, Snyder announced a financial emergency for the city of Detroit[90] and appointed an emergency manager, Kevyn Orr. As a result of emergency manager appointments under Snyder's watch, over half of the state's black population lived in cities where the local government was appointed rather than elected by the voters.[91]\nOn December 27, 2013, Snyder signed a bill into law which nullified Section 1021 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which contained a controversial provision that allowed the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[92]\nOn January 23, 2014, Snyder announced plans to offer visas to 50,000 immigrant workers with advanced degrees to help jumpstart the Detroit economy. The program's advocates claimed the program was expected to bring an influx of new jobs and a more stable tax base.[93]\nIn June 2014, Snyder appointed a 15-member commission for improving and reforming Michigan's public defense efforts for the poor in the criminal justice system in order to effectively meet and ensure the rights safeguarded by the Constitution.[94]\nOn September 10, Detroit reached a deal with three Michigan counties over regional water and sewer services that was hoped to eliminate one roadblock to federal court approval of the city's plan to adjust its debt and exit bankruptcy. The deal with Oakland, Wayne and Macomb counties created a regional water and sewer authority, but allowed Detroit to maintain control of its local system. The deal was crucial to adjusting the city's $18 billion of debt and exiting the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy.[95]\nOn December 18, the Governor issued an executive order to establish the Michigan Department of Talent and Economic Development to house a new state agency, Talent Investment Agency, created from the merger of Michigan State Housing and Development Authority, the Workforce Development Agency, the Governor's Talent Investment Board and the Unemployment Insurance Agency. Over objections from the state legislature, the department would come into effect 60 days after the start of the next legislative session.[96]\nIn November 2015, Governor Rick Snyder declared his opposition to permitting Syrian refugee relocation to the state of Michigan.[97]\nA compilation of online surveys showed that Snyder's approval rating was below 40 percent in April 2018.[98]\nIn December 2018, Snyder granted clemency to 61 Michigan prisoners.[99]\n\nCabinet[edit]\n\n\nName\nTitle(s)\n\n\nNick Lyon\n\nDirector of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services\n\n\nNick Khouri\n\nState Treasurer\nGroup Executive for Treasury (Treasury Department, Lottery and Gaming control board)\n\n\nRoger Curtis\nDirector of the Department of Talent and Economic Development\n\n\nJeff Mason\nCEO of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation\n\n\nDavid De Vries\n\nMichigan CIO\nDirector of the Department of Technology, Management, and Budget (DTMB)\nValue for Money group executive (Budget Office, DTMB, Office of the State Employer)\n\n\nMaj.

In 2014, emergency manager Darnell Earley was responsible for changing the source of drinking water for the city to the Flint River, which has trihalomethanes (TTHM) in it.[100] It was later discovered that the water was too corrosive, and leached lead out of the service lines that was then ingested by the people of the city.[101][102] In September 2015, a study by the Hurley Medical Center found that the community's children were being poisoned by the lead.[103] While Flint transitioned back to its prior source of water in October 2015,[104] lead levels in the city's water remain above the federal action level.[105][106]\nAmid allegations that the Michigan Health Department was stalling water treatment expert Marc Edwards' effort to obtain public records, journalists have asked when the State of Michigan knew about the lead poisoning.[107] Details were released by the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News on 26 February 2016 that Valerie Brader, Snyder's senior policy adviser and deputy legal counsel, and his chief legal counsel Mike Gadola had expressed concerns to him about Flint's water in October 2014, nearly six months after Flint had begun using the river water to save money, despite Governor Snyder claiming he was unaware of the issue until very recently.[108]\nA petition from Angelo Scott Brown, a Flint pastor and former Democratic Party gubernatorial candidate, to recall Snyder was denied by the Board of State Canvassers.[109][110]  Filmmaker and Flint native Michael Moore has called for Snyder's arrest on charges of corruption and assault, and has started a petition on his website.[111][112]\nOn November 13, 2015, four families filed a federal class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in Detroit against Snyder and thirteen other city and state officials, including former Flint Mayor Dayne Walling and ex-emergency financial manager Darnell Earley. The complaint alleges that the officials acted recklessly and negligently, leading to serious injuries from lead poisoning, including autoimmune disorders, skin lesions, and \"brain fog.\"[113][114][115]\nOn December 15, 2015, Mayor Weaver declared the water issue as a citywide public health state of emergency to prompt help from state and federal officials.[116]  Snyder apologized for the incident.[117][118] Snyder declared a State of Emergency on January 5, 2016, for Genesee County, Michigan.\nOn January 16, 2016, Snyder requested that the federal government declare a state of emergency in Flint.[119]\nAccording to The Detroit News and NPR, \"...in March 2016 Snyder released a new 75-point action plan to address the contamination crisis, calling for a \u201cmuch higher standard\u201d for drinking water regulations but stopping short of advocating for complete replacement of all underground lead service lines in the city. The plan included short-, intermediate- and long-term goals, including making infrastructure improvements; creating a data-sharing agreement with state and federal environmental agencies; and setting up a protocol for a \u201cdrinkability declaration\u201d for Flint water.\"[120][121]\nIn mid-April 2016, Snyder initiated his own 30-Day Flint Challenge. \"The plan was to drink solely Flint tap water for an entire month to show residents that the water was safe and that he cared about the people.\"[122] However, the Detroit Metro Times reported that the governor left town on April 23 to spend the week touring Europe for trade discussions, breaking his promise.\nIn July 2018, Drs Hernan Gomez of the University of Michigan and Kim Dietrich of the University of Cincinnati, toxicology and environmental health experts, published an Op-ed article in the New York Times titled  \u201cThe Children of Flint were not \u2018Poisoned.\u201d In the essay article the authors referred to the findings in a study \u201cToxicohistrionics\u201d: Flint, Michigan and the Lead Crisis published in the June issue of The Journal of Pediatrics.[123] According to their opinion and the study, there was a small increase of children whose blood lead levels surpassed the Centers for Disease Control reference level (from 2.2 percent to 3.7 percent), but none were at a level that required urgent medical treatment.\"[124][125]\nOn April 16, 2020, an article was published giving details of evidence of corruption and a cover-up by Snyder and his \"fixer\" Rich Baird, and saying the statute of limitations on some of the most serious felony misconduct-in-office charges would expire on April 25, 2020. The article was published by Vice News, written by Jordan Chariton and Jenn Dize, the co-founders of Status Coup, with photos by Brittany Greeson.[126] Responses from Michigan state authorities denied that a deadline was approaching and said that criminal prosecutions would follow.[127][128]\nOn January 12, 2021, It was announced that nine former government officials including Rick Snyder would face charges resulting from the Flint water crisis.[129][130] Snyder was charged with two misdemeanors of willful neglect but he pleaded not guilty to the charges.[13][12][131] Following its practice of paying the legal costs for state employees charged with a criminal offense, the administrative board of Michigan approved an up to $1.45 million contract with Warner Norcross & Judd law corporation to defend the former governor Snyder.[132]\n\nSubsequent career[edit]\nJust before leaving the governor's office, Snyder formed a new Ann Arbor based company called RPAction LLC whose staff consists of former officials of the Snyder administration.[133]\nOn June 29, 2019, Snyder accepted a soon-to-be appointment at Harvard to share his knowledge of state and local government.[134] On July 3, he tweeted that he was \"turning down\" the offer: \"It would have been exciting to share my experiences, both positive and negative; our current political environment and its lack of civility makes this too disruptive.  I wish them the best.\"[135]\nSnyder endorsed Democrat Joe Biden during the 2020 United States presidential election, alleging that \"President Trump lacks a moral compass. He ignores the truth\" and that the president \"also demonstrated that he does not fully appreciate policy matters, including public health, the economy and foreign relations, nor does he seem to want to learn.\"[136]\n\nElectoral history[edit]\n\nRepublican Primary \u2013 2010 Michigan gubernatorial election[137]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nRick Snyder\n\n381,327\n\n36.4\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nPete Hoekstra\n\n280,976\n\n26.8\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nMike Cox\n\n240,409\n\n23.0\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nMike Bouchard\n\n127,350\n\n12.2\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nTom George\n\n16,986\n\n1.6\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n1,044,925 \n\n100 \n\n\n\nMichigan gubernatorial election, 2010[138]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\u00b1%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nRick Snyder \n\n1,874,834 \n\n58.11% \n\n+15.81% \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nVirg Bernero\n\n1,287,320\n\n39.90%\n\n-16.46%\n\n\n\n\nLibertarian\n\nKen Proctor\n\n22,390\n\n0.69%\n\n+0.08%\n\n\n\n\nConstitution\n\nStacey Mathia\n\n20,818\n\n0.65%\n\n+0.46%\n\n\n\n\nGreen\n\nHarley Mikkelson\n\n20,699\n\n0.64%\n\n+0.12%\n\n\nMajority\n\n587,514\n\n18.21%\n\n+4.15%\n\n\nTurnout\n\n3,226,088\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican gain from Democratic\n\nSwing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan gubernatorial election, 2014[139]\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\u00b1%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nRick Snyder (incumbent) \n\n1,607,399 \n\n50.92% \n\n-7.19% \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nMark Schauer\n\n1,479,057\n\n46.86%\n\n+6.96%\n\n\n\n\nLibertarian\n\nMary Buzuma\n\n35,723\n\n1.13%\n\n+0.44%\n\n\n\n\nConstitution\n\nMark McFarlin\n\n19,368\n\n0.61%\n\n-0.04%\n\n\n\n\nGreen\n\nPaul Homeniuk\n\n14,934\n\n0.47%\n\n-0.17%\n\n\n\n\nWrite-ins\n\n\n\n50\n\n0.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n\nMajority\n\n128,342\n\n4.06%\n\n-14.15%\n\n\nTurnout\n\n3,156,531\n\n\n\n-2.16%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican hold\n\nSwing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nBiography portalBusiness and economics portalMichigan portalPolitics portal\nFlint water crisis\nFinancial emergency in Michigan\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Team, The SensCy (January 14, 2022). \"About SensCy - SensCy\".
