    "wiki": "American political journalist and commentator\nMichael E. Kinsley[1] (born March 9, 1951) is an American political journalist and commentator. Primarily active in print media as both a writer and editor, he also became known to television audiences as a co-host on Crossfire.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nKinsley was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Lillian (Margolis) and George Kinsley, who practiced medicine.[2][3] Kinsley is Jewish.[4] He attended the Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, then graduated from Harvard College in 1972. At Harvard, Kinsley served as vice president of the university's daily newspaper, The Harvard Crimson. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, then returned to Harvard for law school.\n\nEarly career[edit]\nWhile a third-year law student, Kinsley began working at The New Republic. He was allowed to finish his Harvard juris doctor degree through courses at the evening program at George Washington University Law School.\nKinsley's first exposure to a national television audience was as moderator of William Buckley's Firing Line. In 1979, he became editor of The New Republic and wrote the magazine's TRB column for most of the 1980s and 1990s. That column was reprinted in a variety of newspaper op-ed pages, including The Washington Post, and made Kinsley's reputation as a leading political writer. He shared the 1986 Gerald Loeb Award for Commentary.[5]\nKinsley also served as managing editor of Washington Monthly (in the mid-1970s, while still in school), editor at Harper's (for a year and a half in the early 1980s), and American editor of The Economist (a short-term, honorary position).\n\nCrossfire and Slate[edit]\nFrom 1989 to 1995, Kinsley appeared on CNN's Crossfire, co-hosting with conservative Pat Buchanan. Representing the liberal position in the televised political debates, Kinsley combined a dry wit with nerdy demeanor and analytical skills.\nIn January 1995, Kinsley had a cameo on the first episode of the TV sitcom Women of the House, in which the show's main character, Suzanne Sugarbaker, was a guest on Crossfire. He also appeared in three movies during the 1990s: Rising Sun (1993), Dave (also 1993), and The Birdcage (1996).[6]\nAfter leaving Crossfire in 1995, Kinsley returned to his editorial roots, relocating to Seattle to become founding editor of Microsoft's online journal, Slate. In 1998 he was considered for the position of editor in chief of The New Yorker.[7][8] In 1999 he was named Editor of the Year by the Columbia Journalism Review for his work at Slate.\nKinsley stepped down from Slate in 2002, shortly after disclosing that he had Parkinson's disease.[9]\n\nSubsequent positions[edit]\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Kinsley on Big Babies, January 21, 1996, C-SPAN Presentation by Kinsley on Please Don't Remain Calm, May 8, 2008, C-SPAN Q&A interview with Kinsley on Old Age: A Beginners Guide, May 22, 2016, C-SPAN\nKinsley next moved to the Los Angeles Times as editorial page editor in April 2004. He maintained his Seattle residence and often worked from there, commuting to Los Angeles on a part-time basis. During his tenure, Kinsley tried to overhaul the paper's editorial page and led an abortive experiment with a Wikitorial, while also receiving criticism from USC professor and feminist advocate Susan Estrich alleging a dearth of editorials written by women. Kinsley announced his departure in September 2005 after a falling out with the publisher.[10]\nHe returned to writing a weekly column for The Washington Post and Slate, and in 2006 he served briefly as American editor of The Guardian. He also became a regular columnist for Time magazine, but in May 2009 wrote that the magazine had \"dumped\" him.[11]\nOn September 9, 2010, Kinsley and MSNBC pundit Joe Scarborough joined the staff of Politico as the publication's first opinion columnists. On April 29, 2011, Bloomberg L.P. announced that Kinsley had joined the Bloomberg View editorial board. In January 2013, Kinsley re-joined The New Republic as editor at large.[12] In January 2014, Vanity Fair announced that Kinsley would become a contributing editor and write a monthly column.[13]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 2002, Kinsley married Patty Stonesifer, a longtime top executive at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (As a Microsoft vice president, she had managed the Microsoft news portion of the MSNBC merger, which included Slate.) Stonesifer has two adult children from a previous marriage. She is president and CEO of Martha's Table, a non-profit that develops sustainable solutions to poverty.[14]\nIn 2002, Kinsley revealed that he had Parkinson's disease,[15] and on July 12, 2006, he underwent deep brain stimulation, a type of surgery designed to reduce its symptoms.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nBiography portal\nKinsley gaffe\nList of newspaper columnists\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Kinsley, Michael E. in libraries (WorldCat catalog)\n\n^ Collins, Nancy (28 March 2014). \"Nancy Collins on Michael Kinsley\".

His father was a mail carrier.[3][5][4]\nHe attended Brooklyn College and was a member of the Brooklyn College Varsity Dramatic Society, appearing in productions at local theaters[6] and in radio performances.[7] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1938.[8]\n\nCareer[edit]\nWhile at Brooklyn College, he made his Broadway debut in 1937 in the short-lived production of Wall Street Scene.[9] He also performed in Yiddish radio, and in 1941 changed his name to Michael Strong.[4] After a stage career that included one of the principal roles in the play Men to the Sea, he was signed to a personal contract by Hal. B. Wallis at Paramount Pictures in 1945, and was slated to make his screen debut in the film The Searching Wind in the role created on stage by Montgomery Clift.[10] Strong did not appear in the film.\nHe was a charter member of The Actors Studio.[11]\nStrong appeared in the 1949 stage and William Wyler's 1951 film version of Detective Story, playing a cat burglar, and was cast by Elia Kazan in supporting and ensemble roles, twice appeared in the opening night casts of plays by Arthur Miller. He played the bartender Chuck in Sidney Lumet\u2019s televised adaptation of The Iceman Cometh in 1960. He appeared with Zero Mostel and Eli Wallach in an adaptation of Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco's Rhinoceros. he was the understudy for Jack Klugman in  the 1959 Broadway production of the Gypsy.[4]\nStrong was a regular on live programming during the Golden Age of Television, including the Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse, a showcase for young actors, and in early television series including Danger and Suspense.  His performances in those shows  were \"admired for extracting feeling from the smallest gesture.\" He was a regular on the soap opera The Edge of Night.[4]\nIn 1962, Kazan invited Strong, Jason Robards and other actors in forming the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center. In its inaugural season in 1963-1964, he appeared in productions of Incident at Vichy and After the Fall.[4]\nHe made guest appearances in over 120 television series during his career on shows such as The Green Hornet (in \"Hornet Save Thyself\"), Decoy, Naked City, The Eleventh Hour, The F.B.I., The Fugitive, I Spy, Mission: Impossible (five episodes), Columbo (in \"Negative Reaction\"), The Streets of San Francisco, The Big Valley, Planet of the Apes and Hawaii Five-O.  He played Dr. Roger Korby in the Star Trek episode \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\".\nIn 1975, Strong appeared in a production of The Dybbuk at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.[4]\nAmong his film credits are Point Blank,  Patton, and The Great Santini.\n\nChekhov film[edit]\nPaul Newman was impressed by Strong's performance of a one-act Anton Chekhov monologue at the Actors Studio in 1959, and cast him in a starring role in a short film based on a Chekhov play of the same name, On the Harmfulness of Tobacco. The 25-minute film, which was shot in five days at the Orpheum,[12] then a Yiddish theater, on the Lower East Side. was only given a short release at theaters in New York and Los Angeles. At its release, a brief New York Times review called it a\u201c top-flight, one-man tour de force by Michael Strong.\u201d It has been described as a \"lost masterpiece.\"[4]\nStrong was regarded as an \"actor's actor\" by co-stars such as Kirk Douglas and Karl Malden. The Forward, in recounting the film in 2017, said \"it\u2019s hard not to wonder if he might have joined their ranks if this film had been released.\" In January 1962, Newman took his name off the film and declined to work on obtaining distribution, which crushed Strong.[4] Newman told biographer Daniel O'Brien, \"I did that as an exercise for myself... I did it to see whether I could handle a camera and direct actors.\" Newman \"didn't think it had turned out that well.\"[12] The film was shown in 2017 at Lincoln Center for the first time since 1962.[13]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nHis first wife was Theda Kropf, a fellow acting student at Brooklyn College who became a kindergarten teacher. She and Strong taught theater at Camp Unity, an interracial summer camp for adults in Wingdale, New York.[4] They divorced in 1966.[14] His second wife was actress Diane Shalet, who was an actress and intern with the Lincoln Center troupe.[4][15] He had two children with Kropf: Paul and Ellen Strong.[4]\nStrong died of stomach cancer in Los Angeles, California, on September 17, 1980, aged 62.[4][16]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nA partial filmography follows.\n\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1950\nThe Sleeping City\nDr. Alex Connell\nUncredited\n\n\n1951\nDetective Story\nLewis Abbott\nappeared on Broadway in same role\n\n\n1962\n\nOn the Harmfulness of Tobacco\n\nIvan Ivanovich Nyukhin\n\ndirected by Paul Newman, considered a lost film\n\n\n1966\nDead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round\nPaul Feng\n\n\n\n1967\nPoint Blank\nStegman\n\n\n\n1968\nSecret Ceremony\nDr. Walter Stevens\nUncredited\n\n\n1970\nPatton\nBrig.

As an associate at Saperstein, Goldstein, Demchak & Baller, she specialized in plaintiff-side class action suits alleging race and gender discrimination.[5]\nAlexander was a visiting professor at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York from 2016 to 2021.[6]\nIn 2018, she was hired as an opinion columnist at The New York Times.[7] There she collaborated on a piece with Leslie Alexander entitled \"Fear\" which became a chapter in Nikole Hannah-Jones's \"The 1619 Project.\"\n\nThe New Jim Crow[edit]\nMain article: The New Jim Crow\nAlexander published her book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness in 2010. In it, she argued that systemic racial discrimination in the United States resumed following the Civil Rights Movement, and that the resumption is embedded in the US War on Drugs and other governmental policies and is having devastating social consequences. She considered the scope and impact of this to be comparable with that of the Jim Crow laws of the 19th and 20th centuries. Her book concentrated on the high rate of incarceration of African-American men for various crimes.[8] Alexander wrote, \"Race plays a major role\u2014indeed, a defining role\u2014in the current system, but not because of what is commonly understood as old-fashioned, hostile bigotry. This system of control depends far more on racial indifference (defined as a lack of compassion and caring about race and racial groups) than racial hostility \u2013 a feature it actually shares with its predecessors.\"[9]\nThe New Jim Crow described how oppressed minorities are \"subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, public benefits, and jury service, just as their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents once were.\"[9] Alexander argued the harsh penalty of how \"people whose only crime is drug addiction or possession of a small amount of drugs for recreational use find themselves locked out of the mainstream society\u2014permanently\u2014and also highlights the inequality presented from the fact that \"blacks are admitted to prison on drug charges at a rate from twenty to fifty-seven times greater than that of white men.\"[10]\nThe New Jim Crow was re-released in paperback in 2012. As of March 2012 it had been on The New York Times Best Seller list for six weeks[11] and it also reached number 1 on the Washington Post bestseller list in 2012. The book has been the subject of scholarly debate and criticism.[12][13][14][15]\nIn the fall of 2015, all freshmen enrolled at Brown University read The New Jim Crow as part of the campus's First Readings Program initiated by the office of the dean of the college and voted on by the faculty.[16]\nYale University clinical law professor James Forman Jr., while acknowledging many similarities and insights in the Jim Crow analogy, has argued that Alexander overstates her case for decarceration, and leaves out important ways in which the newer system of mass incarceration is different. Forman Jr. identifies Alexander as one of a number of authors who have overstated and misstated their case.[17] He asserts that her framework overemphasizes the War on Drugs, and ignores violent crimes, arguing that Alexander's analysis is demographically simplistic.\nAlexander refers to electronic ankle monitoring practices as the \"Newest Jim Crow,\" increasingly segregating people of color under bail reform laws that \"look good on paper\" but are based on a presumption of guilt and replace bail with shackles as pre-trial detainees consent to electronic monitoring in order to be released from jail.[18]\n\nHidden Colors 2[edit]\nAlexander appeared in a 2012 documentary Hidden Colors 2: The Triumph of Melanin, in which she discussed the impact of mass incarceration in melanoid communities. Alexander said: \"Today there are more African American adults, under correctional control, in prison or jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850 a decade before the Civil War began.[19]\n\n13th[edit]\nAlexander appeared in the 2016 documentary 13th directed by Ava DuVernay. As an interviewee, Alexander described the evolution of racial disparity in the United States of America through its evolution from slavery, the Jim Crow laws, the War on Drugs, to mass incarceration.[20] Alexander said, \"So many aspects of the Old Jim Crow are suddenly legal again once you've been branded a felon. And so it seems that in America, we haven't so much ended racial caste but simply redesigned it\".[21]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 2002, Alexander married Carter M. Stewart, a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Law School.[22] Stewart at the time was a senior associate at McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen, a San Francisco law firm,[23] and later was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio.[24][25] They have three children.[26] Her father-in-law is a former member of the board of directors of The New York Times.[23]\nIn a 2019 opinion piece for The New York Times, written subsequent to the passing of the Ohio \"Heartbeat Bill\", Alexander wrote of being raped during her first semester of law school, becoming pregnant as a result, and then aborting the pregnancy.[27]\n\nAwards[edit]\n2005: Soros Justice Fellowship from the Open Society Institute[28]\n2016: 21st Annual Heinz Award in Public Policy[29]\n2017: The Ohio State University, Office of Diversity and Inclusion's Frank W.

She has been a senior correspondent for The American Prospect, a columnist for The Daily Beast and Slate, and a senior writer for The Nation.[2] Her books are Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism (2006); The Means of Reproduction: Sex, Power, and the Future of the World (2009); and The Goddess Pose: The Audacious Life of Indra Devi, the Woman Who Helped Bring Yoga to the West (2015).\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nGoldberg was born in a Jewish family in Buffalo, New York,[1] the daughter of Carolyn and Gerald Goldberg.[3][4] Her father was managing editor of The Buffalo News and her mother was a math professor at Niagara County Community College.[4] Goldberg received a Bachelor of Arts degree at the State University of New York at Buffalo. She also holds a Master of Science degree in journalism from the University of California Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.[1]\nFrom her early teens she was active in the abortion rights cause, escorting a pregnant 13-year-old friend to an abortion clinic when she herself was 13 and participating in protests and abortion-clinic defense as a high-school senior.[5]\nIn an opinion column titled, \"Rant for Choice\", published in the student newspaper at SUNY Buffalo in 1995, Goldberg wrote of on-campus anti-abortion demonstrators, \"spit at them. Kick them in the head.\" Goldberg later told the Buffalo News, \"Just like someone who says, 'I'm going to kill you,' I didn't mean it literally. I didn't call the article 'A Call to Arms'.\"[6][7]\n\nCareer[edit]\nBeginning in 2002, Goldberg was for several years a senior writer for Salon.[8][9] For approximately two years, through September 2015, she was senior contributing writer at The Nation.[10]\nShe worked as a senior correspondent at The American Prospect and a columnist for The Daily Beast and Slate magazine.[1] Her work has been published in The New Republic, Rolling Stone, Tablet and Glamour,[11] and in The Guardian,[1] The New York Times, The Washington Post,[2] and other newspapers. \n\nBooks[edit]\nGoldberg's first book, Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism (2006), was a finalist for the 2007 New York Public Library's Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism.[12] In 2009, she published The Means of Reproduction: Sex, Power, and the Future of the World (2009),[12] which is based on her own reporting about the state of women's reproductive rights across several continents,[9] and explores what she terms the \"international battle over reproductive rights.\"[13]\n\nOpinions and controversies[edit]\nIn 2012, Goldberg criticized a column written in USA Today by Ann Romney, wife of politician and businessman Mitt Romney. Romney wrote that there was \"no crown more glorious\" than the \"crown of motherhood.\" Goldberg responded that such phrases reminded her of \"pronatalist propaganda of World War II-era totalitarian regimes.\" Conservative media outlets criticized Goldberg for the remark; she subsequently said, \"I should have realized that right-wingers were going to pretend that I was saying that Romney is akin to two of the century's most murderous tyrants. ... I'm truly sorry to have given the right a pretext for another tedious spasm of feigned outrage.\"[14]\nIn 2013, in The Nation, Goldberg criticized the public and media reactions to a tweet by a woman who was fired for tweeting \"Going to Africa. Hope I don\u2019t get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!\" She wrote, \"Almost any of us could be vulnerable to a crowd-sourced inquisition.\"[15] In a July 17, 2020, column in the New York Times headlined, \"Do Progressives Have a Free Speech Problem?\" Goldberg wrote, \"The mass uprising following the killing of George Floyd has led to a necessary expansion of the boundaries of mainstream speech.... At the same time, a climate of punitive heretic-hunting, a recurrent feature of left-wing politics, has set in, enforced, in some cases, through workplace discipline, including firings.\"[16]\nIn 2014, Goldberg wrote a piece for The New Yorker, titled \"What is a Woman?,\" about the conflict between transgender women and some radical feminists.[17] It was criticized by Jos Truitt in the Columbia Journalism Review on the basis of Goldberg's support for those feminists labelled as  \"trans-exclusionary radical feminists\" (or \"TERFs\").[18]\nGoldberg endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[19]\n\nIn the September 17, 2017, issue of The New York Times Book Review, Goldberg published a critical review of Vanessa Grigoriadis's study of college rape, Blurred Lines: Rethinking Sex, Power, and Consent on Campus, which included errors that the publication later corrected. \"Michelle is free to dislike my book,\" Grigoriadis wrote to Book Review editor Pamela Paul. \"She is not free to make demonstrably false statements that not only damage my book but my reputation and credibility as a reporter.\"[20] The Book Review correction read, A review on Page 11 this weekend about \"Blurred Lines: Rethinking Sex, Power and Consent on Campus\", by Vanessa Grigoriadis, refers incorrectly to her reporting on the issues. She does in fact write about Department of Justice statistics that say college-age women are less likely than nonstudent women of the same age to be victims of sexual assault; it is not the case that Grigoriadis was unaware of the department's findings. In addition, the review describes incorrectly Grigoriadis's presentation of statistics from the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. She showed that there is disagreement over whether the data are sound; it is not the case that she gave the reader \"no reason to believe\" the statistics are wrong.[21]\nRegarding the corrected review, Goldberg stated on Twitter: \"Two things are true here. I made a serious error. And one of the book's major claims about its subject isn't correct.\"[22] She also said that she would \"give a kidney and five years of my life\" to retract her errors and that \"This whole thing is turning into a round robin of fuckups.\" According to Vanity Fair, one Times source called the incident \"a significant error,\" while another described the fallout as \"humiliating\".[23]\n\nNew York Times columnist[edit]\nThe New York Times named Goldberg as an opinion columnist in September 2017.[24]\n\"We have entered a period of minority rule,\" Goldberg declared in her debut column, \"Tyranny of the Minority,\" published September 25, 2017. Goldberg argued that the U.S. Constitution's bias toward small states in the Electoral College and U.S. Senate, along with the gerrymandering of U.S. House seats and other factors, gives the Republican Party a structural advantage in national elections, allowing it to win control of the federal government without winning the most votes nationwide. \"Twice in the last 17 years, Republicans have lost the popular vote but won the presidency, and it could happen again,\" she warned. \"[President Donald] Trump's election has revealed many dark truths about this country. One of them is: We\u2019re a lot less democratic than we might think.\"[25] Since then, many other political commentators have echoed Goldberg's critique.[26][27][28]\nGoldberg takes a sanguine view on immigration, she feels that \"America is tearing itself apart as an embittered white conservative minority clings to power, terrified at being swamped by a new multiracial polyglot majority.\" She contends, though, that \"American voters can do to white nationalists what they fear most. Show them they\u2019re being replaced.\"[29]\nGoldberg was a strong critic of Donald Trump's presidency. In an October 17, 2020, column headlined \"Trump\u2019s Misogyny Might Finally Catch Up With Him\", she wrote: \"If Trump loses, it won\u2019t be just because enough women recognize him as a deranged bigot, it will because he blighted too many of their lives.\"[30]\nFrom 2018 to 2021, Goldberg appeared on the weekly podcast \"The Argument,\" in which she and other columnists for the newspaper debated major national issues.[31] Much of the ideological disagreement on the podcast arose between Goldberg and conservative columnist Ross Douthat, though in their final appearance together on the show in February 2021, each reflected on how the other's arguments had influenced them.[32]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nGoldberg lives in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, New York, with her husband, Matthew Ipcar,[1][13] in \"a small apartment with small kids.\"[33] She describes herself in Kingdom Coming as a secular Jew.[34]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nKingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism.

She was a Fox News contributor and in May 2020 joined Newsmax TV. Malkin has written seven books and founded the conservative websites Twitchy and Hot Air.[2]\nAround 2019, Malkin began to distance herself from conventional conservatism and instead publicly support members of the extreme right, including Nick Fuentes,[3][4][5] as well as other white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and Groypers, including Identity Evropa leader Patrick Casey.[3][5][6] In November 2019, she was dropped by conservative organization Young America's Foundation (YAF), citing her support for individuals associated with antisemitism and white nationalism.[5][7]\n\n\nEarly life\nMichelle Malkin was born October 20, 1970,[1] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Philippine citizens Rafaela (n\u00e9e Perez), a teacher, and Apolo DeCastro Maglalang, who was then a physician-in-training.[1] Several months prior to Malkin's birth, her parents immigrated to the United States on an employer-sponsored visa.[1][8] After her father finished his medical training, the family moved to Absecon, New Jersey.[1] She has described her parents as Ronald Reagan Republicans who were \"not incredibly politically active\".[1]\nMalkin, a Roman Catholic,[1] attended Holy Spirit High School, where she edited the school newspaper and aspired to become a concert pianist.[1] Following her graduation in 1988, she enrolled at Oberlin College.[1] Malkin had planned to pursue a bachelor's degree in music, but changed her major to English.[1] During her college years, she worked as a press inserter, tax preparation aide, and network news librarian.[9] At Oberlin, she wrote for a conservative student newspaper started by Jesse Malkin, who later became her husband.[1][10] Her first article for the paper heavily criticized Oberlin's affirmative action program, and she said it received a \"huge[ly] negative response\" from other students on campus.[1] She graduated in 1992 and later described her alma mater as \"radically left-wing\".[11][12]\n\nCareer\nJournalism\nMalkin began her journalism career at the Los Angeles Daily News, working as a columnist from 1992 to 1994. In 1995, she worked in Washington, D.C. as a journalism fellow at the libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute.[9][13] In 1996, she moved to Seattle, Washington, where she became a columnist for The Seattle Times. According to Goldsea, by the end of the year \"Malkin was unleashing the no-holds-barred style of political spitballing that would ultimately make her a poster girl for the radical right\".[1]\nSince 1999, Malkin has written a syndicated column for Creators Syndicate.[14] Her column is published by outlets including Townhall. Some publications which previously carried her column, such as The Daily Wire and National Review, stopped doing so around 2019 when she began to espouse more extreme views.[3][15] The white supremacist publication American Renaissance began publishing her column in 2020.[16]\nOn April 24, 2006, Malkin launched the conservative blog Hot Air, where she remained CEO until she sold the website in 2010.[17][18] The site's staff at launch included Allahpundit and Bryan Preston; Preston was later replaced by Ed Morrissey on February 25, 2008.[17][19] In February 2010, Salem Communications bought Hot Air from Malkin.[18] In March 2012, Malkin founded the website Twitchy, a Twitter content curation site. She sold Twitchy, also to Salem Communications, the following year.[20]\nFor years, Malkin was a frequent commentator for Fox News and a regular guest host of The O'Reilly Factor.[3][21][22] In 2007, she announced that she would not return to The O'Reilly Factor, alleging that Fox News had mishandled a dispute over derogatory statements made about her by Geraldo Rivera in a Boston Globe interview.[23][24] Malkin joined Conservative Review's online television network, CRTV, when it launched in 2016, to host the documentary-style show Michelle Malkin Investigates.[25][22] Malkin left CRTV under unclear circumstances when it merged with TheBlaze in December 2018.[26][27][28] Malkin later joined competitor Newsmax TV in May 2020, where she began to host the show Sovereign Nation.[21][29]\n\nBooks\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Malkin on Invasion, December 8, 2002, C-SPAN\nMalkin published her first book, Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists, Criminals, and Other Foreign Menaces, in 2002.[30] It reached #14 on the New York Times bestseller list.[31]\nIn 2004, she published In Defense of Internment: The Case for 'Racial Profiling' in World War II and the War on Terror,[32] defending the U.S. government's internment of 112,000 Japanese Americans in prison camps during World War II, and arguing that racial profiling is acceptable in times of war.[33] The book drew harsh criticism from mainstream scholars, organizations, and individuals including the Japanese American Citizens League and Fred Korematsu.[34][35][6] The Historians' Committee for Fairness, an organization of scholars and professional researchers, published an open letter condemning the book for not having undergone peer review and arguing that its central thesis is false.[36][37] Some conservative scholars spoke out in support of the book, including Thomas Sowell and Daniel Pipes.[35] The Virginian-Pilot called her \"an Asian Ann Coulter\" and dropped her column in November 2004.[38] Eric L. Muller also published a critique of In Defense of Internment.[39]\nMalkin's third book, Unhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild, was released in October 2005.[40] Malkin released her fourth book, Culture of Corruption: Obama and His Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks, and Cronies, in July 2009.[41] It remained on The New York Times Non-Fiction, Hardcover Best Seller list for six weeks.[42][43] Her fifth book, Who Built That: Awe-Inspiring Stories of American Tinkerpreneurs, was released in May 2015 and was a response to the \"you didn't build that\" statement made by President Barack Obama three years earlier, on July 13, 2012.[44][45] Malkin published Sold Out: How High-Tech Billionaires & Bipartisan Beltway Crapweasels Are Screwing America's Best & Brightest Workers in 2015 along with John Miano.[46] She published Open Borders Inc.: Who's Funding America's Destruction? in 2019.[47]\n\nBlogging\nIn June 2004, Malkin launched a political blog, MichelleMalkin.com. A 2007 memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee described Malkin as one of the five \"best-read national conservative bloggers\".[48] In December 2008, Malkin's blog was the largest conservative blog,[49] and in 2011, the people search company PeekYou reported that Malkin had the largest digital footprint of any political blogger.[50] In April 2020, Malkin moved her blog and its archives to The Unz Review, a far-right website run by former publisher of The American Conservative, Ron Unz.[51][52] According to the Anti-Defamation League, The Unz Review is \"a site that features numerous white supremacists and antisemites and is run by Ron Unz, who has written a number of antisemitic tracts.\"[4]\nMalkin has also been a contributor to the far-right anti-immigration website VDARE, writing a weekly column since 2002.[53]\n\nJamil Hussein\nMain article: Jamil Hussein controversy\nIn late 2006 and early 2007, Malkin was a leading voice among several right-wing bloggers who questioned both the credibility and the existence of Iraqi police captain Jamil Hussein, who had been used as a source by the Associated Press in over 60 stories about the Iraq war.[54][55][56] The controversy began in November 2006 when the AP reported that six Iraqis had been burned alive as they left a mosque and that four mosques had been destroyed, citing Hussein as one of its sources. The Iraqi Ministry of the Interior and the United States military initially denied Hussein existed, leading Malkin and others to dispute the AP's reporting.\nIn January 2007 the AP reported that the Ministry had acknowledged Hussein's existence, and that authorities were seeking his arrest for having spoken to the press.[55][56][57] Malkin reported the Iraqi government's confirmation. According to The Washington Post, Malkin also \"expressed regret\", though media scholar Arthur S. Hayes wrote in his 2008 book Press Critics are the Fifth Estate that her post \"contains no apology or words of regret from her\".[58][56]\n\nSpeaking\nMalkin speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2016\nFor 17 years, Malkin was a featured speaker for Young America's Foundation (YAF). On November 14, 2019, during a YAF-sponsored speech at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Malkin praised white nationalist political commentator Nick Fuentes.[59] In the same speech, she spoke supportively of the Proud Boys, Laura Loomer, and former Iowa Republican Representative Steve King.[3] YAF cut ties with Malkin on November 18, saying, \"there is no room in mainstream conservatism or at YAF for holocaust deniers, white nationalists, street brawlers, or racists\".[60][3] Organizers at Bentley University also canceled a scheduled book promotion event after the incident.[3]\nMalkin has spoken at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). She was a featured speaker in 2019, and her anti-immigration speech, in which she condemned the \"ghost\" of John McCain, drew controversy.[60] In 2020, Malkin spoke at the America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC), an event organized by Nick Fuentes that was described by Rolling Stone as the \"right-wing extremist answer to CPAC\".[3][61] She also received press credentials to attend CPAC 2020, but did not speak at the conference.[62] She spoke again at AFPAC 2021.[63]\n\nViews\nUntil 2019, Malkin was generally described as a conservative.[49][56] Beginning in 2019, some publications began to describe her as right-wing, while some continue to describe her as conservative.[60][63][64][65] She has been described as far-right by HuffPost in 2019, and Business Insider, Vanity Fair, and the Washingtonian in 2020.[66][67][68][69] She has been described as alt-right by The Bulwark and The Independent in 2020.[70][71]\n\nDaniel Holtzclaw\nMalkin with Jenny Holtzclaw in 2016\nMalkin has written about Daniel Holtzclaw, a former Oklahoma City Police Department patrol officer who was convicted in December 2015 of multiple counts of rape, sexual battery, forcible oral sodomy, and other sexual charges.[72] She has repeatedly argued that she believes Holtzclaw is innocent, saying that the forensic evidence backs his version of events, not the accusers' versions, and also that the investigators chose not to perform several tests she characterized as routine.[73][74] Malkin debuted her first and second episodes of CRTV.com's Daniel in the Den on December 12, 2016, in Enid.[75] Malkin released her film about the case, entitled Railroaded: Surviving Wrongful Convictions in 2017.[76]\n\nImmigration\nMalkin supports stricter immigration laws in the United States. She was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2019, where she said levels of immigration into the United States amount to an \"invasion\" and \"endanger our general welfare and the blessings of liberty\".[66] She also condemned politicians, including the \"ghost\" of recently deceased Senator John McCain, for failing to enact stricter immigration regulation.[77][78]\nSince 2002, Malkin wrote a weekly column for VDARE, a far-right anti-immigration website.[6] In a 2002 appearance on Hannity & Colmes, Malkin called for militarization of the Canadian border, comparing Canada to conflict zones where United States troops were deployed and saying, \"Canada bears a lot of responsibility for making us as vulnerable as we are to terrorism\".[79]\nIn 2017, Malkin endorsed alt-right candidate Paul Nehlen in his ultimately unsuccessful primary challenge against Paul Ryan for Wisconsin's 1st congressional district, citing Nehlen's opposition to \"elites\" who support open borders as the reason for her endorsement.[15][70]\n\nMuslims\nMalkin has advocated for interning Muslims on national security grounds.[34] Malkin also defended \"racial, ethnic, religious, and nationality profiling policies\" used during the War on Terror.[6]\nMalkin has covered anti-Muslim topics on episodes of her CRTV show Michelle Malkin Investigates, including \"The Muslim Refugee Rape Epidemic\" and \"Honor Killings: The Real War on Women\".[6] Malkin promoted her 2019 book, Open Borders Inc., at the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a non-profit that has been described as Islamophobic.[6]\n\nSupport for white nationalists\nExternal videos Malkin delivers a speech at the first America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC). Washington, D.C. (February 2020). Hosted by Nicholas J. Fuentes.\nAmanda Carpenter wrote in March 2020 that Malkin had begun to \"link arms with the most vocal elements of the white nationalist movement\".[3] In August 2020, the Anti-Defamation League wrote, \"in the past year ... she has publicly and explicitly allied herself with white supremacists\" and that she herself was \"echoing\" white supremacist views.[4] The Southern Poverty Law Center described her in January 2021 as a \"former conservative-pundit-gone-white-nationalist-apologist\".[80]\nYAF dismissed Malkin in November 2019 after she gave a YAF-sponsored speech at UCLA titled  \"America First: the Torch Is Being Passed\". In her speech, she praised Nick Fuentes as \"one of the New Right leaders\", and also spoke supportively of the Proud Boys, Laura Loomer, and Steve King.[3] In 2020, Malkin faced criticism for speaking at the America First Political Action Conference, which is hosted by white nationalist Nick Fuentes and also featured Patrick Casey, the founder of the neo-Nazi group Identity Evropa.[3][5] Malkin has also supported Gavin McInnes, and has described him and Laura Loomer as friends of hers.[6] She has described herself as the \"mommy\" of the Groypers, a loose collection of white nationalists who follow Nick Fuentes.[81][82]\nIn 2020, Malkin appeared on Red Ice, a white supremacist radio program, and cautioned listeners about changing demographics and \"multicultural rot\".[16]\nIn November 2021, Malkin delivered a speech at the annual American Renaissance Conference, hosted by the white supremacist New Century Foundation.[83][84] Malkin and her family were subsequently banned from using Airbnb in reaction to her having appeared at the event.[85][86]\n\nAccusations of antisemitism\nAccording to Bridge Initiative, a Georgetown University research project on Islamophobia,[87] Malkin has promoted conspiracy theories about George Soros on her social media and on Fox News programs.[6] In 2019, Malkin joined far-right commentator Gavin McInnes for a Facebook Live event to promote her book, and agreed with him when he claimed that Soros was \"not a Holocaust survivor\" but a \"Holocaust facilitator\": Malkin has denied accusations of anti-semitism, saying that she is \"the proud wife of a grandson of Ukrainian Jews who came to this country to escape pogroms [and is] a proud supporter of Israel, but more importantly, a proud supporter of American sovereignty.\"[88] At the 2020 America First Political Action Conference, Malkin said it was \"not anti-semitic\" to question \"whatever the precise number of people is who perished in World War II.\"[7]\n\n2020 United States presidential election\nSee also: Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election\nFollowing the 2020 United States presidential election, Malkin helped advance the conspiracy theory that the election was stolen from Trump. She used the #StopTheSteal hashtag on Twitter and spoke at a Stop the Steal rally in her hometown of Colorado Springs to protest the election results.[89] She also appeared in a trailer for a film about the movement, which also featured Fuentes and Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander.[90]\n\nPersonal life\nWhile in college at Oberlin, she began dating Jesse Malkin.[22] They married in 1993 and have two children.[14] Jesse Malkin worked as a healthcare consultant for RAND Corporation.[1] Jesse is a retired health economist, who now works on his wife's speaking engagements and helps her run her business.[22]\nMalkin and her family lived in North Bethesda, Maryland, until 2008 when they relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado.[91][92]\n\nPublications\nBooks\nIn Defense of Internment: The Case for 'Racial Profiling' in World War II and the War on Terror (ISBN 0-89526-051-4)\nUnhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild.

He paused the show in January 2015 in order to explore a potential bid for the presidency. From April 2012 through December 2013, he hosted a daily radio program, The Mike Huckabee Show, on weekday afternoons for Cumulus Media Networks.[2] Huckabee is the author of several best-selling books, co-founder of the Kids Guide to Fighting Socialism,[3] an ordained Southern Baptist Pastor noted for his evangelical views,[4] a musician, and a public speaker. He was also a political commentator on The Huckabee Report.[5]\nIn the 2008 Republican presidential primaries, Huckabee won the 2008 Iowa Republican caucuses and finished second in delegate count and third in both popular vote and number of states won, behind John McCain and Mitt Romney. Huckabee ran again for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election, but withdrew early in the primary following a disappointing finish in the Iowa caucus.\nHuckabee is the father of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a former White House press secretary and the current governor of Arkansas.[6]\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nHuckabee was born on August 24, 1955, in Hope, Arkansas,[7] the son of Dorsey Wiles Huckabee (1923\u20131996) and his wife Mae (Elder) Huckabee (1925\u20131999), conservative Southern Democrats. Huckabee is of English, German, and Scots-Irish ancestry, with roots in America dating to the Colonial Era.[8][9] He has cited his working-class upbringing as the reason for his political views;[10] his father worked as a fireman and mechanic, and his mother worked as a clerk at a gas company.[11]\nHis first job, when he was 14, was at a radio station, where he read the news and weather.[12] He was elected governor of Arkansas by his chapter of the American Legion-sponsored Boys State program in 1972.[7] He was student council vice president at Hope High School during the 1971\u20131972 school year. He was student council president at Hope High School during the 1972\u20131973 school year.[13] He has one sister, Pat Harris, a middle school teacher.[14] He entered the ministry in 1972 at Garrett Memorial Baptist Church in Hope.\nHuckabee married Janet McCain on May 25, 1974.[14][15] He graduated from Ouachita Baptist University on May 8, 1978,[16] completing his bachelor's degree in religion before attending Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He dropped out of the seminary after one year in order to take a job in Christian broadcasting.[17][18][19]\n\nPastoral career[edit]\nHuckabee playing bass guitar at Thomas Road Baptist Church in 2008\nAt age 21, Huckabee was a staffer for televangelist James Robison.[13] Robison commented, \"His convictions shape his character and his character will shape his policies. His whole life has been shaped by moral absolutes.\"[13] Prior to his political career, he served as pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, from 1980 to 1986, and the Beech Street First Baptist Church in Texarkana, from 1986 to 1992.\nHuckabee started 24-hour television stations in both Pine Bluff and Texarkana, where he produced documentaries and hosted a program called Positive Alternatives.[7] He encouraged the all-white Immanuel Baptist Church to accept black members in the mid-1980s.[13][20] Years later, he wrote about the insights he gained as a minister:\n\nMy experience dealing every day with real people who were genuinely affected by policies created by government gave me a deep understanding of the fragility of the human spirit and vulnerability of so many families who struggled from week to week. I was in the ICU at 2 a.m. with families faced with the decision to disconnect a respirator on their loved one; I counseled fifteen-year-old pregnant girls who were afraid to tell their parents about their condition; I spent hours hearing the grief of women who had been physically and emotionally clobbered by an abusive husband; I saw the anguish in the faces of an elderly couple when their declining health forced them to sell their home, give up their independence, and move into a long-term-care facility; I listened to countless young couples pour out their souls as they struggled to get their marriages into survival mode when confronted with overextended debt ...[21]\nIn 1989, Huckabee ran against Ronnie Floyd of Springdale for the presidency of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention. Huckabee won and served as president from 1989 to 1991.[22]\nHuckabee has received two honorary doctorates: a Doctor of Humane Letters, received from John Brown University in 1991, and a Doctor of Laws from Ouachita Baptist University in 1992.[23]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nLieutenant Governor of Arkansas, campaign 1992[edit]\nIn Huckabee's first political race in 1992, he lost to incumbent Democratic senator Dale Bumpers, receiving 40 percent of the vote in the general election.[24] In the same election, Arkansas governor Bill Clinton was elected president, making lieutenant governor Jim Guy Tucker the new governor when Clinton resigned the governorship. In 1993, Republican state chairman Asa Hutchinson urged Huckabee to run in the special election for lieutenant governor held on July 27. Realizing his loss came among key conservative Democrats, Huckabee ran a decidedly conservative campaign. In the subsequent general election, he defeated Nate Coulter, who had been Bumpers's campaign manager the previous year,[25] 51\u201349 percent.[7] Huckabee became the second Republican since Reconstruction to serve as Arkansas lieutenant governor, the first having been Maurice Britt from 1967 to 1971.\nIn his autobiography From Hope to Higher Ground, Huckabee recalled the chilly reception that he received from the Arkansas Democratic establishment on his election as lieutenant governor: \"The doors to my office were spitefully nailed shut from the inside, office furniture and equipment were removed, and the budget spent down to almost nothing prior to our arriving. After fifty-nine days of public outcry, the doors were finally opened for me to occupy the actual office I had been elected to hold two months earlier.\"[26]\nDick Morris, who had previously worked for Bill Clinton, advised Huckabee on his races in 1993, 1994, and 1998.[27] Huckabee commented that Morris was a \"personal friend\".[27] A newspaper article reported on Huckabee's 1993 win: \"Morris said the mistake Republicans always make is that they are too much of a country club set. What we wanted to do was run a progressive campaign that would appeal to all Arkansans.'\"[27]\nMorris elaborated, \"So we opened the campaign with ads that characterized Mike as more of a moderate whose values were the same as those of other Arkansans.\"[27] Consequently, he abandoned his earlier support for the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC) when in April 1994 following an adverse media campaign against the CofCC, Huckabee withdrew from a speaking engagement before their national convention. He repeated the accusations made by various media and civil rights organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center recalling his past association with the CofCC saying, \"I will not participate in any program that has racist overtones. I've spent a lifetime fighting [against] racism and anti-Semitism.\"[28]\nIn 1994, Huckabee was re-elected to a full term as lieutenant governor, beating Democratic candidate Charlie Cole Chaffin with nearly 59 percent of the vote.[29] While lieutenant governor, Huckabee accepted $71,500 in speaking fees and traveling expenses from a nonprofit group, Action America. R. J. Reynolds was the group's largest contributor.[20]\nIn October 1995, David Pryor announced that he was retiring from the United States Senate. Huckabee then announced he was running for the open seat and moved ahead in the polls,[7] but ultimately dropped out of the race to lead the state after incumbent governor Jim Guy Tucker resigned following his fraud and conspiracy convictions.[30]\nDuring his campaign, Huckabee opposed in December then-governor Tucker's plan for a constitutional convention.[31] The plan was defeated by voters, 80\u201320 percent, in a special election. In January 1996, Huckabee campaigned in televised ads paid for by the Republican National Committee and the Arkansas Republican Party against a highway referendum. Tucker supported the referendum, which included tax increases and a bond program, to improve 1,300 miles (2,100\u00a0km) of highway.[32] On the referendum, the bond question, which included a sales tax increase and a gas tax increase, lost 87\u201313 percent. A second question, a five-cent increase on diesel tax, lost 86\u201314 percent.[32][33] Huckabee also opposed Tucker's plan for school consolidation.[33]\n\nGovernor of Arkansas, 1996\u20132007[edit]\nMain article: Governorship of Mike Huckabee\nGovernor Huckabee at Opening Ceremonies of the Big Dam Bridge\nIn May 1996, Tucker was convicted \"on one count of arranging nearly $3 million in fraudulent loans\" as part of the Whitewater controversy. The Arkansas Constitution, like nearly all state constitutions in the United States, does not allow convicted felons to hold office. Tucker thus promised to resign by July 15.[7] Huckabee then announced he would quit the Senate race and instead fill the unexpired term of Tucker.[30] However, Tucker, insisting he had a strong case for appeal,[34] rescinded his resignation as Huckabee was preparing to be sworn in on July 15. Within a few hours, Tucker reinstated his resignation after Huckabee and the legislature threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against Tucker.[13] Huckabee was then duly sworn in as governor.\nIn November 1998, Huckabee was elected to a full four-year term by defeating retired colonel Gene McVay in the primary and Jonesboro attorney and Democratic candidate Bill Bristow in the general election, becoming the state's third elected Republican governor since Reconstruction.\nAccording to a CNN exit poll, Huckabee received 48% of the African American vote in his 1998 election;[35] but some experts have questioned whether those numbers are a representative sample on how he did on the whole in the election.[36]\nIn 2001, Huckabee was named \"Friend of a Taxpayer\" by Americans for Tax Reform for his cut in statewide spending.[37]\nIn November 2002, Huckabee was reelected to his 2nd 4-year term by defeating State Treasurer Jimmie Lou Fisher, garnering 53 percent of the vote. His reelection came despite the defeat in the general election of fellow Republican U.S. Senator Tim Hutchinson.\nHuckabee received widespread praise for his state's rapid response to Hurricane Katrina. In 2005, Time named him one of the five best governors in the U.S., writing \"Huckabee has approached his state's troubles with energy and innovation\" and referred to him as \"a mature, consensus-building conservative who earns praise from fellow Evangelicals and, occasionally, liberal Democrats.\"[38] Governing magazine likewise honored Huckabee as one of its 2005 Public Officials of the Year.[39] Additionally, he was among those legislators given the APHA Distinguished Public Health Legislator of the Year Award by the American Public Health Association[40] for that same year.\nIn 2006, he was presented with AARP's Impact Award for his health initiatives.[41]\nIn December 2008, Huckabee became an honorary member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He said that did not have time to join a fraternity in college because he had to \"cram four years into a little more than two\". The fraternity's CEO said they were \"very impressed with his character and the initiatives he headed\" as governor.[42]\nBy the end of his term, Huckabee held the 3rd-longest tenure of any Arkansas governor. Only Democrats Orval Faubus, who served 6 consecutive 2-year terms (1955\u20131967), and Bill Clinton, who served 11 years, 11 months (1979\u20131981; 1983\u20131992), had longer tenures.\nDuring his tenure as governor, Huckabee supported tax reforms including tax cuts and increases, that netted $505 million for the state.[43] According to columnist Margaret Carlson, that money was used to improve roads, health care and schools in the state.[44]\n\nClemencies[edit]\nFurther information: 2009 Lakewood shooting, Wayne DuMond, and Maurice Clemmons\nAs governor, Huckabee commuted and accepted recommendations for pardon for twice as many sentences as his 3 predecessors combined; in total: 1,033 prisoners.[45] Twelve had previously been convicted of murder.[46] Though Huckabee pardoned more than his predecessors, the state prison size and number of people executed were greater as well,[47] Huckabee denied 92% of all clemency requests during his 10.5 years as governor.[48] Most pardons and commutations were not for prisoners but for those whose sentences had ended and who were seeking work.[49] Huckabee's pardons and commutations became an issue during the 2008 Republican Primary, with most of the controversy focusing on Wayne Dumond.[50]\nHuckabee's handling of clemency petitions received national attention in November 2009 with the case of Maurice Clemmons, who had committed burglary without a weapon at 16. The Prison Transfer Board unanimously requested a sentence commutation for Clemmons as did the trial judge.[48] Clemmons's 60-year sentence was commuted by Huckabee to 47 years, making him eligible for parole if approved by the parole board. After parole in 2000, Clemmons was arrested for multiple offenses including child molestation and aggravated assault but was released after prosecutors declined to file charges. After Clemmons murdered four police officers in Lakewood, Washington, a two-day manhunt ensued, and Clemmons was shot and killed by a Seattle Police Department officer after refusing police orders to stop charging the officer.[51] In his book about the shooting, The Other Side of Mercy, Jonathan Martin of The Seattle Times wrote that Huckabee apparently failed to review Clemmons's prison file, which was \"thick with acts of violence and absent indications of rehabilitation\".[52] Huckabee defended his actions, stating that the recommendation to reduce the sentence was unanimous and supported by the trial judge, that the decision to parole him was made by the parole board, not him, and that Clemmons had been re-arrested and the decision not to file charges then had nothing to do with him.[53][54]\n\n2008 presidential election campaign[edit]\nMain article: Mike Huckabee 2008 presidential campaign\nSee also: 2008 United States presidential election\nHuckabee announced his run for the White House on Meet the Press on January 28, 2007.[55]\nAt the August 11 Iowa Straw Poll, Huckabee took second place with 2,587 votes, roughly 18 percent, splitting the conservative Republican party votes amongst other candidates.[56] Huckabee spent $57.98 per vote in the Straw Poll, which is the lowest among the top three finishers.[57] Huckabee drew attention with an unconventional ad featuring Chuck Norris.[58] In a later ad Huckabee wished voters a merry Christmas, and said that \"what really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ.\"[59]\nIn November 2007, Huckabee drew endorsements from a large number of religious activists, including Billy McCormack, a pastor in Shreveport, Louisiana, and a director and vice president of the Christian Coalition of America, founded in 1988 by a previous presidential candidate, Pat Robertson.[60] He was criticized for using a bookshelf that resembled a cross in a Christmas commercial as a form of signaling to Christians, and laughed them off saying \"I will confess this: If you play the spot backwards, it says, 'Paul is dead. Paul is dead.'\"[61][62] He also faced a \"drumbeat\" of questions about the role of faith in his gubernatorial administration and about past statements he made in 1998 about the U.S. being a \"Christian nation\" in which he said, \"I hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Christ.\" Huckabee told NBC that his comment was not politically incorrect and was \"appropriate to be said to a gathering of Southern Baptists\".[63] Huckabee has credited God with some of his political success.[64]\nOn January 3, 2008, Huckabee won the Iowa Republican caucuses, receiving 34% of the electorate and 17 delegates, compared with the 25% of Mitt Romney, who finished second, receiving 12 delegates; Fred Thompson, who came in third place and received three delegates; John McCain, who came in fourth place and received three delegates; and Ron Paul, who came in fifth place and received two delegates.\n\nHuckabee with actor Chuck Norris in Londonderry, New Hampshire (2008)\nOn January 8, 2008, Huckabee finished in third place in the New Hampshire primary, behind John McCain in first place, and Mitt Romney who finished second, with Huckabee receiving one more delegate for a total of 18 delegates, gained via elections, and 21 total delegates, versus 30 total (24 via elections) for Romney, and 10 for McCain (all via elections).\nOn January 15, 2008, Huckabee finished in third place in the 2008 Michigan Republican primary, behind John McCain in second place; Mitt Romney, who finished first; and ahead of Ron Paul, who finished in fourth place.[65]\n\nHuckabee giving a speech following the South Carolina 2008 presidential primary in Columbia, SC\nOn January 19, 2008, Huckabee finished in second place in the 2008 South Carolina Republican primary, behind John McCain, who finished first and ahead of Fred Thompson, who finished third.[66]\nOn January 29, 2008, Huckabee finished in fourth place in the Florida primary, behind Rudy Giuliani in third, Mitt Romney in second, and John McCain in first place.\nOn January 21, 2008, Huckabee received the endorsement of 50 African American leaders in Atlanta, Georgia. The endorsers cited Huckabee's record on abortion, education, minorities, the economy, the prison system, and immigration as Arkansas governor.[67] However, NBC reported that the endorsement of African American leaders at the Atlanta event was 36, and \"most of them connected to conservative religious organizations\".[68]\nOn February 5, 2008, Huckabee won the first contest of \"Super Tuesday\", the West Virginia GOP state convention, but only after the McCain campaign provided their delegates, thereby giving Huckabee 52% of the electorate to Mitt Romney's 47%.[69] Backers of rival John McCain said they threw Huckabee their support to prevent Mitt Romney from capturing the winner-take-all GOP state convention vote.[70] Consequently, he also registered victories in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Tennessee on Super Tuesday, bringing his delegate count up to 156, compared with 689 for Republican party front-runner John McCain.[71]\n\nHuckabee with a supporter at a campaign rally in Wisconsin\nOn February 9, 2008, Huckabee won the first election following Super Tuesday, by winning 60% of the vote in the Kansas Republican Caucuses.[72]\nThis was also the first contest to be held without Mitt Romney, who was said to be splitting the conservative vote with Huckabee.[73] Huckabee also won the Louisiana Republican Primary with 44% of the vote to John McCain's 43% in second. Although Huckabee won the primary he was not awarded any delegates, because of state party rules that stated a candidate must pass the 50% threshold to receive the state's pledged delegates.[74]\nOn March 4, 2008, Huckabee withdrew from seeking the candidacy as it became apparent he would lose in Texas, where he had hoped to win, and that John McCain would get the 1,191 delegates required to win the Republican nomination. Huckabee finished the race with 240 pledged delegates.[75]\n\nVice presidential candidate speculation[edit]\nEven though Huckabee had signed a television contract and a book deal with a pressing deadline, he was mentioned by most to be on then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain's short list for his vice presidential running mate. The late pundit Tim Russert even referred to Huckabee as \"Vice President Huckabee\" several times when he appeared on Meet The Press on May 18, 2008.[76] Huckabee was eventually passed over for Sarah Palin.[77]\nFormer president Bill Clinton has praised Huckabee and stated that he is a rising star in the Republican Party. Clinton and Huckabee have collaborated on initiatives such as the fight against childhood obesity.[78] Former Tennessee Republican Party chairman and Huckabee's former campaign manager Chip Saltsman has called Governor Huckabee, \"The most successful failed presidential candidate in the history of our country\".[79]\n\nSpeculated 2012 presidential campaign[edit]\nFormer Governor Huckabee speaking at the 2011 Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans, Louisiana\nSee also: 2012 United States presidential election\nIn a November 19, 2008, article by the Associated Press, Huckabee addressed the possibility of running for president in 2012. He said, \"I'm not ruling anything out for the future, but I'm not making any specific plans.\"[80]\nAmid speculation about a future run for the presidency, a CNN poll in December 2008 found Huckabee at the top of the list of 2012 GOP contenders, along with former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin, fellow 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.[81]\nOn December 3, 2008, Cincinnati-based NBC affiliate WLWT asked Huckabee about the prospect of running, to which he said, \"I'm pretty sure I'll be out there. Whether it's for myself or somebody else I may decide will be a better standard bearer, that remains to be seen.\"[82]\nA June 2009 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation national poll showed Huckabee as the 2012 presidential co-favorite of the Republican electorate along with Palin and Romney.[83] An October 2009 poll of Republicans by Rasmussen Reports put Huckabee in the lead with 29%, followed by Romney on 24% and Palin on 18%.[84] In a November 2009 Gallup poll, Huckabee was shown as the leading Republican contender for 2012.[85] In November 2010 CNN projected in a poll that Huckabee would defeat Barack Obama in a hypothetical 2012 contest.[86] In a Rasmussen poll taken January 11\u201314, 2011, Huckabee was even with Obama at 43% each.[87]\nHuckabee took stances opposed to the nature of the incumbent president, Barack Obama. In comments made March 1, 2011, on The Steve Malzberg Show, Huckabee said of Obama, \"I would love to know more. What I know is troubling enough. And one thing that I do know is his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits, for example, is very different than the average American.\"[88] (This is a reference to the Mau Mau Uprising against the colonial rule of the United Kingdom in 1952; Obama himself has never lived in Kenya.)[89]\nOn May 14, 2011, Huckabee announced on his FNC show that he would not be a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012. Despite his high national poll numbers and being seen by many as the front runner, Huckabee declined to run, saying, \"All the factors say 'go,' but my heart says 'no.'\"[90]\n\n2016 presidential campaign[edit]\nMain article: Mike Huckabee 2016 presidential campaign\nSee also: 2016 United States presidential election\nHuckabee speaking at 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland\nPolitical commentators speculated that Huckabee might be ready for another presidential run in 2016. He was limited by a lack of money in 2008 but with changes to federal election law allowing SuperPACs to pour large sums of money into a race he might be better positioned to stay in the race.[91] Huckabee has in addition earned personal wealth since 2008 on the lecture circuit and his TV and radio shows. He ended his daily radio show in December 2013, which strengthened speculations about a presidential bid.[92][93]\nHuckabee indicated in September 2014 that he would make the decision on whether to run early in 2015.[94] In January 2015, Huckabee ended his show on FNC to prepare for his possible run in the 2016 presidential election.[95] On March 30, 2015, Huckabee supporters launched a Super PAC to make preparations for his run for the presidential ticket in 2016.[96]\nOn May 5, 2015, in his hometown of Hope, Arkansas, Huckabee announced a campaign to seek the Republican nomination for president of the United States in the 2016 election.[97] In his speech, Huckabee attacked trade deals that he said drive down U.S. wages, opposed raising the age for Social Security benefits, criticized President Obama for what he said was putting more pressure on Israel than Iran, and made an unusual plea for donations of $15 or $25 a month, saying: \"I will ask you to give something in the name of your children and grandchildren.\"[97]\nOn February 1, 2016, after a disappointing showing in the Iowa caucus Huckabee decided that he was going to suspend his campaign.[98]\n\n2018 Florida gubernatorial election[edit]\nReports emerged in the summer of 2016 that Huckabee, who currently lives in Florida, was considering running for governor of Florida in 2018 to succeed term limited Republican incumbent Rick Scott. However, Huckabee later announced that he was declining to run in the 2018 Florida Gubernatorial election. Had he run and won, he would have become the first person to serve as governor of two separate states since Sam Houston, who served as governor of Tennessee and later as governor of Texas.[99] Before his announcement not to run, an August 2016 poll of Florida Republicans conducted by StPetePolls.org showed Huckabee leading a field of potential Republican gubernatorial candidates with 37%.[100]\n\nTrump administration[edit]\nFollowing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Huckabee met with president-elect of the United States Donald Trump, whom he had supported for the Republican nomination after ending his own campaign in February. It was reported by The Daily Mail and The Jerusalem Post that Trump offered Huckabee the position of United States Ambassador to Israel.[101] Huckabee denied the reports.[102] He told Fox News that a possible cabinet appointment for himself was discussed but that he turned the offer down, saying, \"I'm not sure it was the right fit.\"[103]\nHis daughter Sarah Huckabee Sanders served as White House press secretary to President Donald Trump from July 2017 until July 2019.[104]\nIn January 2018, Huckabee praised Doha, Qatar as being \"surprisingly beautiful, modern, and hospitable\" after a trip there, but did not reveal that a foreign agent for Qatar had paid $50,000 to a corporation run by Huckabee as a \"honorarium for visit\".[105]\nFollowing Trump's defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, Huckabee supported Trump's legal challenges in closely contested states, stating, \"I think he owes it to all of us to make sure the election was fair. I am not saying it wasn't, I don't know. But we need to know, we have to have an answer to the questions that linger.\"[106] On November 15, in a letter addressed to Joe Biden first posted on his website, Huckabee made unsubstantiated claims of election fraud in the 2020 election.[107]\n\nMedia career[edit]\nOn June 12, 2008, Fox News announced it was hiring Huckabee as a political commentator and regular contributor to their 2008 American presidential election coverage, in their New York election headquarters.[108]\nHuckabee filled in for Paul Harvey in July 2008.[109] A few months later, he signed a deal with ABC Radio Networks (now Cumulus Media Networks) to carry a daily commentary, The Huckabee Report, beginning in January 2009.[110] After Harvey's death his show replaced Harvey's broadcasts.[111] On April 15, 2015, Huckabee announced that The Huckabee Report would be ending May 1.[112]\nHuckabee hosted a weekend show, Huckabee, on Fox News Channel, which premiered Saturday, September 27, 2008, at 8 PM EST.[113] For six weeks in summer 2010, Fox test-ran The Huckabee Show for the syndicated market; Huckabee was joined by guest co-hosts in the daily spin-off, among them Bob Barker of The Price Is Right fame.[114] Huckabee ended on January 3, 2015, so that Huckabee could consider the possibility of running for president.[95]\nOn April 2, 2012, Huckabee launched a long-form daily talk show on Cumulus Media Networks, who provide the call-in guests. The show, which is targeted at second-tier broadcast stations, features long-form interviews and discussions and airs in the noon to 3 p.m. time slot, directly opposite the market leader in talk radio, The Rush Limbaugh Show.[115] On November 27, 2013, Huckabee announced that the show will have its final broadcast on December 12, 2013, stating that he and Cumulus Media mutually decided not to renew the contract.[116]\nIn a December 2013 interview, Huckabee stated that he would be launching a news organization in partnership with Christian Media Corp. International.[117]\nIn October 2017, the Huckabee show was relaunched, now produced by and aired on the Trinity Broadcasting Network.[118]\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nMain article: Political positions of Mike Huckabee\nAbortion[edit]\nHuckabee opposes any public funding for abortion, and believes that abortion should be legal only when the life of the mother is at risk.[119] He believes that it would \"most certainly\" be a good day for America if Roe v. Wade were reversed.[120]\n\nHealth care[edit]\nHuckabee opposed Obama's health care plan, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He stated that he wants to \"give citizens more control over their own health care choices\".[121]\n\nFree trade[edit]\nIn his book From Hope to Higher Ground, Huckabee expressed support for free trade, but only if it is \"fair trade.\" He identified excess litigation, excess taxation, and excess regulation as three factors contributing to the loss of American jobs, and has proposed economic sanctions on China.[122]\n\nRace relations[edit]\nAccording to a CNN exit poll, Huckabee won 48% of African American votes in his successful 1998 gubernatorial race in Arkansas.[123] The 48% figure is often disputed due to the exit poll's small sample size.[124] Huckabee says that it is important for Republicans such as himself to reach out to black voters, and in 2015, he ramped up efforts to win those votes.[125]\nIn 2015, on an episode of Meet the Press, Huckabee stated that the confederate flag issue was for South Carolinians to decide, \"not an issue for a person running for president\", and days later, he congratulated Gov. Nikki Haley on her decision to support the removal of the flag from the state capitol.[125] Huckabee gave a speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention that included this: \"I say with sincerity that I have great respect for Senator Obama's historic achievement to become his party's nominee\u2014not because of his color, but with indifference to it. Party or politics aside, we celebrate this milestone because it elevates our country.\"[126]\n\nLGBT rights[edit]\nHuckabee believes that marriage is between one man and one woman, and he opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions. In 2006, he outlawed same-sex marriage in Arkansas, but in 2007 he stated that Americans should \"respect\" gay couples. He says that adoptions should be child focused and opposes \"gay adoptions\".[127] Huckabee, expounding upon his view on homosexuality, said the following: \n\nThis [gay marriage] is not just a political issue. It is a biblical issue. And as a biblical issue\u2014unless I get a new version of the scriptures, it's really not my place to say, OK, I'm just going to evolve[.] . . . It's like asking someone who's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli. We don't want to do that\u2014I mean, we're not going to do that. Or like asking a Muslim to serve up something that is offensive to him, or to have dogs in his backyard[.] . . . We're so sensitive to make sure we don't offend certain religions, but then we act like Christians can't have the convictions that they've had for 2,000 years.\nIn January 2015, he compared homosexuality to \"drinking and swearing\", insofar as it is \"part of a lifestyle\". Huckabee has stated he has gay friends, saying, \"People can be my friends who have lifestyles that are not necessarily my lifestyle. I don't shut people out of my circle or out of my life because they have a different point of view[.]\"[128]\n\nWomen[edit]\nIn comments which he made on March 4, 2011, on the Michael Medved Show, Huckabee spoke about pregnant, unwed actress Natalie Portman, saying \"it's unfortunate we glorify and glamorize the idea of out of wedlock children.\"[129]\nIn January 2014, in a luncheon speech at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting, in response to a federal mandate on contraception, Huckabee stated that \"Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control, they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government.\"[130]\n\nRole of religion in public life[edit]\nHuckabee has voiced his belief in intelligent design and he has also stated that he does not believe that Darwin's theory of evolution is valid. In July 2004, he was quoted on Arkansans Ask, his regular show on the Arkansas Educational Television Network: \"I think that students also should be given exposure to the theories not only of evolution but to the basis of those who believe in creationism.\"[131]\nIn April 2011, Huckabee said, \"I almost wish that there would be a simultaneous telecast and all Americans would be forced, at gunpoint, to listen to every David Barton message,\" in praise of the Christian revisionist author David Barton.[132]\nWithin hours of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Huckabee made headlines in the U.S. and abroad for stating on Fox News: \"We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we have systematically removed God from our schools,\" and he further asked, \"Should we be so surprised that schools would become a place of carnage?\"[133]\nIn September 2014, Huckabee said, \"Fire the ones who refuse to hear not only our hearts, but God's heart\" (for which he was criticized by Richard Dawkins).[134]\nIn September 2015, speaking about his support of religious freedom on behalf of Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to radio host Michael Medved, Huckabee said, \"Michael, the Dred Scott decision of 1857 still remains to this day the law of the land which says that black people aren't fully human. Does anybody still follow the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision?\"[135][136] (The decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford had been superseded by the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and nullified by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.)\nIn June 2016, Huckabee, along with actor Pat Boone and executive producer Troy Duhon, all of whom were involved in the film God's Not Dead 2, sent a letter to California governor Jerry Brown opposing Senate Bill 1146, which \"prohibits a person from being subjected to discrimination\" at California colleges. Other than religious schools\u2014those that train pastors and theology teachers\u2014schools \"might no longer be allowed to hire Christian-only staff, teach religious ideas in regular classes, require attendance at chapel services or keep bathrooms and dormitories restricted to either males or females.\"[137]\n\nClimate change[edit]\nIn 2023, Huckabee published Kids Guide to the Truth About Climate Change, which minimized the influence of human emissions on global warming.[138] Marketed as an alternative to mainstream education, the publication does not attribute authorship or cite scientific credentials.[138] The deputy director of the National Center for Science Education called the publication \"propaganda\" and \"very unreliable as a guide to climate change for kids\", noting that it represented \"present day\" atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide as 280 parts per million (ppm), which was true in 391 BC but short of 2023's actual concentration of 420 ppm.[139]\n\nMilitary[edit]\nIn 2007, Huckabee argued for a larger military and an increase in defense spending, writing, \"Right now, we spend about 3.9 percent of our GDP on defense, compared with about six percent in 1986, under President Ronald Reagan. We need to return to that six percent level.\"[140]\n\nImmigration[edit]\nDuring his bid for president, Huckabee released a nine-point immigration enforcement and border security plan. His plan included building a border fence, increased border patrol personnel, and increased visas for skilled workers who enter the country legally. He has previously stated he is opposed to using military resources for border patrol.[141] Huckabee's plan also required all 11\u201312 million[142] undocumented immigrants to register with the federal government and return to their home countries within 120 days. Failure to do so would carry a 10-year ban from entering the US.[143]\n\nGun control[edit]\nHuckabee has voiced his support for self-defense and the Castle Doctrine, and has generally taken an anti-gun control stance. He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed.[127]\n\nFiscal policy[edit]\nAs governor of Arkansas, Huckabee received grades of B in 1998,[144][145] C in 2000,[146][147] C in 2002,[148][149] D in 2004,[150][151] and F in 2006[152][153] from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors.\n\nPublic image[edit]\nMain article: Public image of Mike HuckabeeHuckabee has both detractors and defenders, even among Republicans. Personality descriptions range from friendly, charming and warm, to petty and aloof.[154][155][156][157][158] He has received support from African-American leaders, praise from a liberal New York Times columnist, criticism from gay rights groups and pundits. Huckabee has made controversial public statements that have brought criticism. He apologized for at least three statements and has admitted that his love for metaphors and tendency to use hyperbole to make a point has backfired on him.[159]\nPersonal life[edit]\nMusic[edit]\nHuckabee plays bass guitar with recording artist Ayla Brown in 2015\nHuckabee plays the electric bass guitar in his classic-rock cover band, Capitol Offense.[160] The group has played for political events and parties, including entertaining at unofficial inaugural balls in Washington, D.C., in January 2001.[161]\nIn 2007, Huckabee was given the Music for Life Award by the National Association of Music Merchants for his music education advocacy.[162]\n\nOrganizations[edit]\nHuckabee was made the chair of the Southern Governors' Association in 1999 and served in capacity through 2000. He has chaired the Southern Growth Policies Board, the Southern Regional Education Board, the Southern Technology Council, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, and the Education Commission of the States. He is also a member of the Republican Governors Association and former chairman of the National Governors Association. Huckabee is chairman of the conservative political action committees Vertical Politics Institute and Huck PAC.\nIn 2006, Huckabee was initiated as a honorary member of Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) Fraternity, motivated in part by his son David being an involved TKE member at Arkansas State University.[163]\nIn July 2010, Huckabee became a fundraiser on behalf of for-profit Victory University in Memphis, Tennessee, and was designated Chancellor of the Victory University Foundation.[164]\n\nHuckabee was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Kennedy Center by President Donald Trump in March 2019. His term on the board expires in September 2024.[165]External videos Oral History, Gov. Mike Huckabee talks about the sacrifice his parents made in giving him one of the greatest gifts he ever received, his first electric guitar. Interview date January 24, 2014, NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) Oral History Library\nWeight loss and advocacy of good health[edit]\nWhen he was elected governor of Arkansas, Huckabee was obese. In 2003, physicians diagnosed him with type 2 diabetes, and they also informed him that he would not live more than 10 years if he did not lose weight. Huckabee acknowledges that he has weighed as much as 300 pounds (135\u00a0kg). Coupled with the death of former Governor Frank D. White (whose obesity contributed to a fatal heart attack) his diagnosis prompted Huckabee to begin eating healthier and exercising. He subsequently lost over 110 pounds (50\u00a0kg).[166][167] The New York Times called the weight loss so rapid that \"it was as if he simply unzipped a fat suit and stepped out.\"[168]\nAlthough Huckabee has stated that he never smoked and he never drank alcohol,[14] he declared himself a \"recovering foodaholic\". Huckabee has publicly recounted his previous burdens as an obese man: the steps of the Arkansas capitol from the entrance of the building up to the Governor's office were so long and steep that he would be out of breath and exhausted by the time he reached the top of the stairs.[169] Huckabee has discussed his weight loss and used health care reform as a major focus of his governorship.[170]\nAt an August 2007 forum on cancer which was hosted by Lance Armstrong, Huckabee said that he would support the imposition of a federal smoking ban, but since then, he has stated that he believes that the issue is best addressed by state and local governments.[171]\nHuckabee has completed several marathons: the 2005 Marine Corps Marathon, the 2005 and 2006 Little Rock Marathon, and the 2006 New York City Marathon.[172] The 2005 Little Rock Marathon featured an impromptu challenge between Huckabee and Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack. Huckabee completed the marathon in 4:38:31, defeating Vilsack by 50 minutes. He wrote a book chronicling his weight-loss experience, Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork. Huckabee was one of 10 recipients of a 2006 AARP Impact Award acknowledging his work as a \"health crusader\".\nIn 2009, Huckabee acknowledged that he had gained back a quarter of his weight due to a foot condition that prevented him from running.[173]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nAt a book signing in 2011\nHuckabee has written or co-authored several books including Do The Right Thing: Inside the Movement That's Bringing Common Sense Back to America (released on November 18, 2008) which became a New York Times Best Seller,[174] Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork and God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy.\n\n\u2014 (1997).

Huckabee discusses the myriad differences he's seen between those who live in the blue, coastal \"bubbles\" and the \"bubbas\" of the red flyover states. Huckabee uses Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 as examples of a \"culture of crude\". He describes Beyonc\u00e9's lyrics as \"obnoxious and toxic mental poison\".[175]\nSee also[edit]\nList of governors of Arkansas\nElectoral history of Mike Huckabee\nRepublican Party presidential candidates, 2016\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Mooney, Alexander (February 26, 2009). \"Jindal earns bad reviews in national debut\".

A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the 50th governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017, and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013.\nBorn and raised in Columbus, Indiana, Pence graduated from Hanover College and then from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law before entering private practice. He lost two House bids in 1988 and 1990 and was a conservative radio and television talk show host from 1994 to 1999. After being elected to the House in 2000, Pence represented Indiana's 2nd district from 2001 to 2003 and 6th district from 2003 to 2013. He chaired the Republican Study Committee from 2005 to 2007 and House Republican Conference from 2009 to 2011. He was elected governor of Indiana in 2012.\nAs governor, Pence initiated the largest tax cut in Indiana's history and pushed for more funding for private education initiatives. He signed bills intended to restrict abortions, including one that prohibited abortions if the reason for the procedure was the fetus's race, gender, or disability, and required funerary services for terminated fetuses, including those resulting from miscarriage;[1] this law was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge and prevented from going into effect.[2][3] After Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, he encountered resistance from moderate members of his party, the business community, and LGBT advocates. The backlash against the bill led Pence to approve changes to the law to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and other criteria. He later became the running mate of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who went on to win the 2016 presidential election.\nAs vice president, Pence chaired the National Space Council following its reestablishment in 2017 and the White House Coronavirus Task Force, which was established in early 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pence and Trump lost their bid for re-election in the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, although Trump's campaign refused to concede, made false or unproven allegations of election fraud and filed many unsuccessful lawsuits in multiple states. Despite Trump's urging to overturn the election results and the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Pence oversaw the certification of Biden\u2013Harris as the winner of the election.\nHe has since distanced himself from Trump, endorsing candidates in primary elections in opposition to those supported by Trump and criticizing the latter's conduct on the day of the attack. In June 2023, he launched a bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, but withdrew by the end of October.[4]\n\n\nEarly life and education\nPence in Columbus North High School's 1977 yearbook\nPence was born on June 7, 1959, in Columbus, Indiana, one of six children of Ann Jane \"Nancy\" Cawley and Edward Joseph Pence Jr.,[5][6] who ran a group of gas stations.[7][8] His father served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and received the Bronze Star in 1953, which Pence displays in his office along with its commendation letter and a reception photograph.[9] His father was of German and Irish descent and his mother is of Irish ancestry.[10] His paternal grandfather, Edward Joseph Pence Sr., worked in the Chicago stockyards.[11] He was named after his maternal grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who emigrated from Doocastle, County Mayo, Ireland, to the United States through Ellis Island and who became a bus driver in Chicago, Illinois.[12][13][14][15] His maternal grandmother's parents were from Doonbeg, County Clare, Ireland.[16][17]\nPence graduated from Columbus North High School in 1977. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in history from Hanover College in 1981, and a Juris Doctor from the Robert H. McKinney School of Law at Indiana University\u2013Purdue University Indianapolis in Indianapolis in 1986.[18] While at Hanover, he joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, where he became the chapter president.[19] After graduating from Hanover, he was an admissions counselor at the college from 1981 to 1983.[20] During his time at Hanover, Pence was a friend of future actor Woody Harrelson, whom he helped prepare to deliver a sermon as part of Harrelson's ministry studies. Harrelson later told late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel that he \"'quite liked [Pence]' at the time\".[21]\nIn his childhood and early adulthood, Pence was a Roman Catholic and a Democrat, as was the rest of his family.[22] He volunteered for the Bartholomew County Democratic Party in 1976 and voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election,[23][14] and has said he was originally inspired to get involved in politics by people such as John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.[23] While in college, Pence left the Catholic Church and became an evangelical, born-again Christian, to the disappointment of his mother.[23][14] His political views also started shifting to the right during this time in his life, something which Pence attributes to the \"common-sense conservatism of Ronald Reagan\" with which he began to identify.[23][24]\n\nEarly career and congressional campaigns\nAfter graduating from law school in 1986, Pence was an attorney in private practice.[25] In 1988, Pence ran for Congress against Democratic incumbent Philip Sharp, but lost.[26] He ran against Sharp again in 1990, quitting his job in order to work full-time in the campaign, but once again was unsuccessful.[26] During the race, Pence used \"political donations to pay the mortgage on his house, his personal credit card bill, groceries, golf tournament fees and car payments for his wife\".[27] While the spending was not illegal at the time, it reportedly undermined his campaign.[27]\n\nPence with President Ronald Reagan at the White House in 1988\nDuring the 1990 campaign, Pence ran a television advertisement in which an actor, dressed in a robe and headdress and speaking in a thick Middle Eastern accent, thanked his opponent, Sharp, for doing nothing to wean the United States off imported oil as chairman of a House subcommittee on energy and power.[27][28] In response to criticism, Pence's campaign responded that the advertisement was not about Arabs; rather, it concerned Sharp's lack of leadership.[27][28] In 1991, Pence wrote an essay, \"Confessions of a Negative Campaigner\", published in the Indiana Policy Review, in which he apologized for running negative ads against Sharp. Pence vowed to refrain from using insulting speech or running ads that belittle his adversaries.[29][30][27][31] Also taking place in 1991, he became the president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a self-described free-market think tank and a member of the State Policy Network, a position he held until 1993.[32][33][34]\nShortly after his first congressional campaign in 1988, radio station WRCR-FM in Rushville, Indiana, hired Pence to host a weekly half-hour radio show, Washington Update with Mike Pence.[35] In 1992, Pence began hosting a daily talk show on WRCR, The Mike Pence Show, in addition to a Saturday show on WNDE in Indianapolis.[32][35][36][37] Pence called himself \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf\" since he considered himself politically conservative while not as bombastic as Limbaugh.[30][38] Beginning on April 11, 1994, Network Indiana syndicated The Mike Pence Show statewide.[39] With a 9:00\u00a0a.m. to noon (ET) time slot, the program reached as many as 18 radio stations in Indiana, including WIBC in Indianapolis.[32] From 1995, Pence also hosted a weekend public affairs TV show likewise titled The Mike Pence Show on Indianapolis TV station WNDY.[35][40] Pence ended his radio and television shows in 1999 to focus on his 2000 campaign for Congress, which he eventually won.[41]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (2001\u20132013)\nRunning for the U.S. House of Representatives again in 2000, he won the seat in Indiana's 2nd congressional district after six-year incumbent David M. McIntosh opted to run for governor of Indiana. The 2nd district (renumbered the 6th in 2002) comprised all or portions of 19 counties in eastern Indiana. As a new congressman, Pence adopted the slogan he had used on the radio, describing himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order\".[42] In 2016, House speaker Paul Ryan described Pence as a \"principled conservative\".[43] While in Congress, Pence belonged to the Tea Party Caucus.[44]\n\nPence as a U.S. Representativeduring the 111th Congress\nIn his first year in office, Pence opposed President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act in 2001,[45] as well as President Bush's Medicare prescription drug expansion in 2003.[46] Pence was re-elected four more times by comfortable margins. In the 2006, 2008, and 2010 House elections, he defeated Democrat Barry Welsh.[47][48][49]\n\nCongressman Pence visits U.S. soldiers in Mosul, Iraq, in 2006.\nPence began to climb the party leadership structure and from 2005 to 2007 was chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative House Republicans.[50] In November 2006, Pence announced his candidacy for leader of the Republican Party (minority leader) in the United States House of Representatives.[51] Pence's release announcing his run for minority leader focused on a \"return to the values\" of the Newt Gingrich-headed 1994 Republican Revolution.[51] However, he lost the bid to Representative John Boehner of Ohio by a vote of 168 for Boehner, 27 for Pence, and one for Representative Joe Barton of Texas.[52] In January 2009, Pence was elected as the Republican Conference chairman, the third-highest-ranking Republican leadership position at the time behind Minority Leader John Boehner and Republican Whip Eric Cantor. He ran unopposed and was elected unanimously. He was the first representative from Indiana to hold a House leadership position since 1981.[53] During Pence's twelve years in the House, he introduced 90 bills and resolutions; none became law.[54] His committee assignments in the House were the following:\n\n107th Congress (2001\u20132003): Agriculture, Judiciary, Small Business[55]\n108th Congress (2003\u20132005): Agriculture, International Relations, Judiciary[56]\n109th Congress (2005\u20132007): Agriculture, International Relations, Judiciary[57]\n110th Congress (2007\u20132009): Foreign Affairs, Judiciary, Select Committee to Investigate the Voting Irregularities of August 2, 2007 (Ranking Member)[58]\n111th Congress (2009\u20132011): Foreign Affairs[59]\n112th Congress (2011\u20132013): Foreign Affairs, Judiciary[60]\nIn 2008, Esquire magazine listed Pence as one of the ten best members of Congress, writing that Pence's \"unalloyed traditional conservatism has repeatedly pitted him against his party elders.\"[61] Pence was mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for president in 2008[62] and 2012.[63] In September 2010, he was the top choice for president in a straw poll conducted by the Values Voter Summit.[64][65] That same year, he was encouraged to run against incumbent Democratic senator Evan Bayh,[66][67][68] but opted not to enter the race,[69] even after Bayh unexpectedly announced that he would retire.[70]\n\n2012 Indiana gubernatorial election\nMain article: 2012 Indiana gubernatorial election\nPence was sworn in as governor of Indiana on January 14, 2013.\nIn May 2011, Pence announced that he would be seeking the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana in 2012.[71] Incumbent Republican Governor Mitch Daniels was term-limited. Pence ran on a platform that touted the successes of his predecessor and promised to continue educational reform and business deregulation of Daniels.[72][73] The Democratic nominee was former Indiana Speaker of the House John R. Gregg. Despite strong name recognition and a popular outgoing governor of the same party, Pence found himself in a heated race, eventually pulling out a close win with just under 50 percent of the vote, and less than 3% ahead of Gregg, with Libertarian nominee Rupert Boneham receiving most of the remaining votes.[74] It was the closest race in 50 years.[75]\n\nGovernor of Indiana (2013\u20132017)\nPence was sworn in as the 50th governor of Indiana on January 14, 2013.[76]\n\nFiscal and economic policy\nPence \"inherited a $2\u00a0billion budget reserve from his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, and the state\u00a0... added to that reserve under his watch, though not before requiring state agencies, including public universities, to reduce funding in years in which revenue fell below projections.\"[77] The state finished fiscal year 2014 with a reserve of $2\u00a0billion; budget cuts ordered by Pence for the $14\u00a0billion annual state budget include $24\u00a0million cut from colleges and universities; $27\u00a0million cut from the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA);[78] and $12\u00a0million cut from the Department of Correction.[79] During Pence's term as governor, the unemployment rate reflected the national average.[80] Indiana's job growth lagged slightly behind the national trend.[81] In 2014, Indiana's economy was among the slowest-growing in the United States, with 0.4 percent GDP growth, compared to the national average of 2.2 percent; this was attributed in part to a sluggish manufacturing sector.[82] Carrier Corp. and United Technologies Electronic Controls (UTEC) announced in 2016 that they would be closing two facilities in Indiana, sending 2,100 jobs to Mexico; the Trump campaign criticized the moves[83] and Pence expressed \"deep disappointment\".[84][85] Pence was unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade the companies to stay in the state, although the companies agreed to reimburse local and state governments for certain tax incentives they had received.[85][86] The Indiana Economic Development Corporation led by Pence had approved $24\u00a0million in incentives to ten companies who sent jobs abroad. $8.7\u00a0million had been paid out by August 2016.[83]\n\nGovernor Pence addresses Indiana State Military at the Indiana War memorial on Veterans Day, 2014.\nIn 2013, Pence signed a law blocking local governments in Indiana from requiring businesses to offer higher wages or benefits beyond those required by federal law. In 2015, Pence also signed the repeal an Indiana law that required construction companies working on publicly funded projects to pay a prevailing wage.[87][88][89][90] Indiana had enacted right-to-work legislation under Pence's predecessor, Republican governor Mitch Daniels. Under Pence, the state successfully defended this legislation against a labor challenge.[88] In 2013, Pence also announced the formation of the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, a life sciences research facility supported with $25\u00a0million in startup funds from the state.[91]\nPence made tax reform, namely a ten percent income-tax rate cut, a priority for 2013.[92][93] While he did not get the ten percent cut he advocated, Pence did accomplish his goal of cutting state taxes.[92] Legislators cut the income tax by five percent and also killed the inheritance tax.[92] Speaker of the House Brian Bosma said the legislative package was the \"largest tax cut in our state's history, about $1.1\u00a0billion dollars\".[94] By signing Senate Bill 1, the state corporate income tax would be dropped from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent by 2021, which would be the second-lowest corporate income tax in the nation.[95] The law also permitted Indiana counties to eliminate the business personal property tax on new equipment and let them exempt small businesses with less than $20,000 worth of equipment from paying personal property taxes.[95]\nOn June 12, 2013, the Indiana Legislature overrode Pence's veto of a bill to retroactively authorize a local tax. Lawmakers overrode his veto by a 68\u201323 vote in the House and a 34\u201312 one in the Senate.[96] Republican legislators overwhelmingly voted against Pence, while most Democrats supported his veto.[97] The Jackson\u2013Pulaski tax fix, one of three bills vetoed by Pence during the session, addressed a 15-year-old county income tax that had been imposed to fund the construction of jail facilities with the stipulation that the tax be lowered by one percent after the first several years. The reduction had not been implemented and thus county residents had been paying an additional one percent tax that they were legally not required to pay. The bill, which was passed by a huge majority of legislators and subsequently vetoed by Pence, allowed money to be kept and not returned to the taxpayers as would have otherwise been necessary.[97][98]\nAs governor, Pence pressed for a balanced budget amendment to the state's constitution. He initially proposed the initiative in his State of the State address in January 2015. The legislation passed the state Senate.[99] Indiana has had AAA credit ratings with the three major credit-rating agencies since 2010, before Pence took office; these ratings were maintained throughout Pence's tenure.[100]\nIn 2014, Pence supported the Indiana Gateway project,[101] a $71.4\u00a0million passenger and freight rail improvement initiative paid for by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the federal stimulus package), which Pence had voted against while a congressman.[102] In October 2015, Pence \"announced plans to pay off a $250\u00a0million federal loan\" to cover unemployment insurance payments which had spiked during the recession.[77] In March 2016, Pence signed legislation to fund a $230\u00a0million two-year road-funding package.[77]\n\nEducation policy\nDuring his tenure as governor, Pence supported significant increases in education funding to pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, but frequently clashed with supporters of traditional public schools.[103][104] In 2014, a little over one year after taking office, Pence helped establish a $10-million state preschool pilot program in Indiana and testified personally before the state Senate Education Committee in favor of the program to convince fellow Republicans (several of whom opposed the proposal) to approve the plan.[103][104] Although the plan was initially defeated, Pence successfully managed to revive it, \"getting Indiana off the list of just 10 states that spent no direct funds to help poor children attend preschool\".[104] Demand for enrollment in the program \"far outstripped\" capacity, and Pence at first refused to apply for up to $80\u00a0million in federal Health and Human Services Preschool Development Grant program funding,[103] arguing that \"Indiana must develop our own pre-K program without federal intrusion.\"[105] After coming under sustained criticism for this position, Pence reversed course and sought to apply for the funds.[103][106]\nIn 2015, Pence secured significant increases in charter-school funding from the legislation, although he did not get everything he had proposed.[104] Legislation signed into law by Pence in 2013 greatly increased the number of students in Indiana who qualify for school vouchers, making it one of the largest voucher programs in the United States.[107][108][109][110] The annual cost of the program was estimated to be $53\u00a0million for the 2015\u20132016 school year.[109][110]\nPence opposed the Common Core State Standards Initiative, calling for the repeal of the standards in his 2014 State of the State address. The Indiana General Assembly then passed a bill to repeal the standards, becoming the first state to do so.[103][104] In a televised interview appearance with Chris Matthews, Pence advocated eroding the teaching of science in public schools by putting religious creationism on a par with established science, accepting \"creationist beliefs\" as factual, and thus \"teaching the controversy\" over evolution and natural selection, and regarding the age of the Earth, and letting children decide for themselves what to believe.[111]\nDespite successful advocacy for more funding for pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, Pence has frequently clashed with teachers unions and supporters of public schooling.[103][104] In one of his first acts as governor, Pence removed control of the Educational Employment Relations Board, which was in charge of handling conflicts between unions and school boards, from Glenda Ritz, a Democrat who was the Indiana superintendent of public instruction (a separately elected position in the state).[112] Pence created a new \"Center for Education and Career Innovation\" (CECI) to coordinate efforts between schools and the private sector; Ritz opposed the center, viewing it as a \"power grab\" and encroachment on her own duties. Pence eventually disestablished the center in order to help defuse the conflict.[103][104] In May 2015, Pence signed a bill stripping Ritz of much of her authority over standardized testing and other education issues, and reconstituting the State Board of Education dominated by Pence appointees.[113] The bill also allowed the board to appoint a chairman other than the Superintendent of Public Instruction starting in 2017, and added the State Board of Education (controlled by Pence) as a \"state educational authority\" along with the Department of Education (controlled by Ritz) for purposes of accessing sensitive student data.[113] Pence and Ritz also clashed over non-binding federal guidelines that advised Indiana public schools must treat transgender students in a way that corresponds to their gender identity, even if their education files indicate a different gender.[114]\n\nEnergy and environment\nDuring Pence's term in office, the Republican-controlled Indiana General Assembly \"repeatedly tried to roll back renewable energy standards and successfully ended Indiana's energy efficiency efforts\".[115] Pence has been an outspoken supporter of the coal industry, declaring in his 2015 State of the State address that \"Indiana is a pro-coal state,\" expressing support for an \"all-of-the-above energy strategy\", and stating: \"we must continue to oppose the overreaching schemes of the EPA until we bring their war on coal to an end.\"[115][116] In 2015, Pence sent a letter to President Obama denouncing the EPA's Clean Power Plan (which would regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants) and stating that Indiana would refuse to comply with the plan.[115][117] Indiana joined other states in a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the plan.[115] In 2016, Pence said that even if legal challenges failed, Indiana would continue to defy the rule and would not come up with its own plan to reduce emissions.[118]\n\nGun policy\nIn 2014, over the opposition of Indiana school organizations, Pence signed a bill which allows firearms to be kept in vehicles on school property.[119] In 2015, following a shooting in Chattanooga, Pence recruited the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard on concealed carry. Some National Guard officials from other states questioned why a civilian organization would be involved in a military issue.[120] In May 2015, Pence signed into law Senate Bill 98, which limited lawsuits against gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers and retroactively terminated the City of Gary's still-pending 1999 lawsuit against gun manufacturers and retailers that allegedly made illegal sales of handguns.[121][122] The bill was supported by Republicans such as state senator Jim Tomes, who hoped the measure would attract more gun-related businesses to Indiana, but opposed by Gary mayor and former Indiana attorney general Karen Freeman-Wilson, who viewed the measure as \"an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of state government\".[122] In 2016, Pence signed Senate Bill 109 into law, legalizing the captive hunting of farm-raised deer in Indiana.[123]\n\nPublic health\nGovernor Pence at the dedication of a new veterans' clinic, March 2016\nIn 2009, parts of East Chicago were discovered to have toxic lead and arsenic contamination, and were designated a Superfund site. Governor Pence declined to declare the Superfund site a state emergency;[124] his successor Governor Eric Holcomb issued Executive Order 17\u201313, declaring a disaster emergency in East Chicago.[125][126] The site of several former lead smelting plants was first identified as a health concern by the EPA in 1997.[127]\nBeginning in December 2014, there was an HIV outbreak in Southern Indiana.[128] In 2011, Planned Parenthood (PP) operated five rural clinics in Indiana. They tested for HIV and offered prevention, intervention and counseling to improve public health outcomes. The PP clinic in Scott County performed no abortions.[129] The Republican-controlled legislature and Pence defunded Planned Parenthood.[130] Scott County has been without an HIV testing center since 2013.[129] Pence had long been a vocal opponent of needle exchange programs, which allow drug users to trade in used syringes for sterile ones in order to stop the spread of diseases, despite solid scientific evidence that such programs prevent the spread of AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV), and Hepatitis C (HCV), and do not increase drug abuse.[128] In March 2015, well after the outbreak began, Pence finally allowed at least five counties to open needle exchanges, but did not move to lift the state ban on funding for needle exchanges.[128] Critics say Pence's compromise had been ineffective because counties had no way to pay for needle exchanges themselves. Anesthesiologist Jerome Adams, then the Pence-appointed Indiana state health commissioner and later surgeon general of the United States during the Trump administration, defended Pence, arguing that publicly funded needle exchange programs are controversial in many conservative communities. During his time as Indiana State Health Commissioner, Adams\u2014along with Governor Pence\u2014delayed Indiana's efforts to deal with the largest HIV outbreak related to injection drug use in the history of the United States by stalling adoption of a needle exchange program. Adams said, \"There are people who have real moral and ethical concerns about passing out needles to people with substance abuse problems. To be honest, I shared that sentiment.\"[131][132] When President Trump appointed Pence in 2020 to head the country's response to coronavirus, he touted his ostensible experience with quelling an epidemic of HIV in Indiana, in which Pence deliberately delayed his state government's response to the disease despite the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control that needle exchange was an efficacious approach to reining in the spread of diseases. Pence had told lawmakers he would veto any bill they might pass that provided for such exchanges.[133][134]\nIn 2015, Pence and the Obama administration agreed to expand Medicaid in Indiana, in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.[135][136] As part of the expansion, called the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, Pence negotiated modifications to the program for Indiana that included co-payments by participants. The co-payments are linked to healthy behaviors on the part of the participants so that, for example, a participant who quit smoking would receive a lower co-payment. Participants can lose benefits for failing to make the payments.[137] The required contribution would be about 2% of income. Critics say those who already struggle to buy food and housing will have even more difficulty paying their 2%. One critic expressed concern that lower-income people may stay out of the program or avoid pursuing health care. A service provider said the program \"wins the award for bureaucratic complexity and red tape\".[138] In early 2017, Indiana submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to renew Healthy Indiana, to show that the program was meeting its targets, as required for renewal. National Public Radio/Side Effects Public Media said the application used \"misleading and inaccurate information\".[139]\n\nReligion and LGBT rights\nSee also: Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Indiana)\nPence addresses supporters at a church service, September 2016\nOn March 26, 2015, Pence signed Indiana Senate Bill 101, also known as the Indiana \"religious objections\" bill or Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), into law.[140] The move was praised by religious conservatives,[141] but criticized by people and groups who felt the law was carefully worded in a way that would permit discrimination against LGBT persons.[142][143][144][145] Such organizations as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the gamer convention Gen Con, and the Disciples of Christ spoke out against the law. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff condemned the law, with the latter's company saying it would halt its plans to expand in the state.[146][147] Angie's List announced that they would cancel a $40\u00a0million expansion of their Indianapolis-based headquarters over concerns with the law. The expansion would have moved 1,000 jobs into the state.[148] Thousands protested against the policy.[142] Five Republican state representatives voted against the bill, and Greg Ballard, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis, criticized it as sending the \"wrong signal\" about the state.[149]\nPence defended the law, saying it was not about discrimination. In an appearance on the ABC News program This Week with George Stephanopoulos,[150] he said, \"We are not going to change this law,\" while refusing to answer whether examples of discrimination against LGBT people given by Eric Miller of anti-LGBT group Advance America would be legal under the law.[151] Pence denied the law permitted discrimination and wrote in a March 31, 2015 Wall Street Journal op-ed, \"If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn't eat there anymore. As governor of Indiana, if I were presented a bill that legalized discrimination against any person or group, I would veto it.\"[152] In the wake of the backlash against the RFRA, on April 2, 2015, Pence signed legislation revising the law to protect against potential discrimination.[153] Pence received heavy criticism from liberals at the time of signing the religious freedom law, who labeled him as anti-gay. In 2018, emails released to the Associated Press showed that conservatives had similarly opposed his support of the subsequent changes to the law.[154]\n\nAbortion\nIn March 2016, as Indiana governor, Pence signed into law H.B. 1337, a bill that both banned certain abortion procedures and placed new restrictions on abortion providers. The bill banned abortion if the reason for the procedure given by the woman was the fetus' race or gender or a fetal abnormality. In addition, the bill required that all fetal remains from abortions or miscarriages at any stage of pregnancy be buried or cremated, which according to the Guttmacher Institute was not required in any other state.[155][156][157] The law was described as \"exceptional for its breadth\"; if implemented, it would have made Indiana \"the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome\".[156] Days after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the bill from taking effect, with U.S. district judge Tanya Walton Pratt determining that the bill was likely to be unconstitutional and that the State of Indiana would be unlikely to prevail at trial.[156] The abortion bill was subsequently ruled unconstitutional in April 2018 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.[158]\n\nMedia and the press\nPence at the 500 Festival Parade in Indianapolis, 2015\nIn June 2013, Pence was criticized for deleting comments of others posted on his official government Facebook page; he subsequently apologized.[159]\nOn January 26, 2015, it was widely reported that Pence had planned to launch a state-run, taxpayer-funded news service for Indiana.[160] The service, called \"JustIN\", was to be overseen by a former reporter for The Indianapolis Star, and would feature breaking news, stories written by press secretaries, and light features.[160] At the time, it was reported that the two employees who would run the news service would be paid a combined $100,000 yearly salary.[160] The target audience was small newspapers which had limited staff, but the site would also serve to communicate directly with the public. The publisher of the Commercial Review of Portland, Indiana, said, \"I think it's a ludicrous idea\u00a0... the notion of elected officials presenting material that will inevitably have a pro-administration point of view is antithetical to the idea of an independent press.\"[160] There was speculation that the news service would publish pro-administration stories that would make Pence look good in the event of a presidential run.[161]\nAccording to the Associated Press, the idea \"of stories prewritten for the media set off a wave of criticism from journalists around the country, who likened the Indiana endeavor to state-run media in Russia and China. Headlines like 'Pravda in the Plains' accompanied calls for Pence to scrap the idea.\"[162] David A. Graham of The Atlantic regarded the announcement of JustIN as evidence of a disturbing changing trend in how the public gets news.[163] After a week or so of controversy about the idea, Pence scrapped the idea saying, \"However well-intentioned, after thorough review of the preliminary planning and careful consideration of the concerns expressed, I am writing you to inform you that I have made a decision to terminate development of the JustIN website immediately.\"[164]\n\nSyrian refugee crisis\nAs governor, Pence attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Syrian refugees from being resettled in Indiana.[165] In February 2016, a federal judge ruled that Pence's order to cut off federal funds for a local non-profit refugee resettlement agency was unconstitutional; Pence has appealed.[165] In December 2015, Pence said that \"calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional\".[166]\n\nPublic-records requests and use of private email\nPence \"repeatedly stonewalled public records requests as governor, often withholding documents or delaying their release if not denying them outright\".[167][168][169] As governor, Pence routinely used a personal AOL email account to conduct official business, according to public records. In 2016, hackers compromised the account and used it to send fraudulent emails in an attempt to obtain money from Pence's contacts.[170] While Pence's use of a private email account for state business is not prohibited by Indiana law, some of the emails discussed sensitive matters and homeland security issues.[171] In March 2017, after Pence had become vice president, the State of Indiana released 29 emails to media outlets that had made public records requests, but withheld an undisclosed number of other emails, saying they were deliberative or advisory and thus exempt from public disclosure.[171] Cybersecurity experts and government transparency advocates were surprised by Pence's use of a personal email account to conduct public business, given Pence's past attacks on Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while U.S. secretary of state.[171] In 2017, Indiana hired a private law firm for $100,000 to handle a backlog of public-records requests for Pence's personal AOL account email correspondence.[167]\n\nRe-election campaign and withdrawal\nMain article: 2016 Indiana gubernatorial election\nPence ran for a second term as governor and was unopposed in the Republican primary on May 3, 2016. He was to face Democrat John R. Gregg in a rematch of the 2012 race. However, Pence filed paperwork ending his campaign on July 15, 2016, as Trump announced his selection of Pence as his vice presidential running mate.[172] Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb was nominated in Pence's place, and selected Suzanne Crouch as his running mate.[173][174] Holcomb went on to defeat Gregg in the general election.[175]\n\n2016 vice presidential campaign\nSee also: 2016 Republican Party vice presidential candidate selection and Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign\nPence speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, August 2016.\nShortly before the 2016 Indiana Republican presidential primary, Pence endorsed Texas U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, who would lose the primary to Trump.[62] Pence then endorsed Trump after the latter became the party's presumptive nominee for president of the United States.[176]\nDonald Trump considered naming Pence as his vice presidential running mate along with other finalists including New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former House speaker Newt Gingrich.[177] Pence had stronger connections at the time to the politically influential big donors, the Kochs, than Trump did.[178][11][179][180][181] It was widely reported on July 14 that Pence planned to end his re-election campaign and accept the Republican vice presidential nomination instead.[182] The following day, Trump officially announced on Twitter that Pence would be his running mate.[183][184][185]\nImmediately after the announcement, Pence said he was \"very supportive of Donald Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States\".[186] Pence said he was \"absolutely\" in sync with Trump's Mexican wall proposal, saying Mexico was \"absolutely\" going to pay for it.[187]\nAccording to a FiveThirtyEight rating of candidates' ideology, Pence was the most conservative vice-presidential candidate in the last 40 years.[188]\nPence called Dick Cheney his role model for vice president.[189]\nDuring Pence's preparations for the vice presidential debate in October 2016, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker played the role of Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine.[190] In Kaine's own debate prep, lawyer Robert Barnett was selected to play Pence.[191] Following the debate, experts concluded Pence won against Kaine, with a CNN poll showing 48 percent of viewers thought Pence won and 42 percent believing Kaine won.[192] Pence's \"cooler\" temperament was seen as an advantage compared to Kaine, who was perceived as more hotheaded.[193][194]\nOn October 7, 2016, lewd comments made by Donald Trump in 2005 surfaced and gained heavy media attention.[195] That day, Pence said to reporters, \"I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them,\" but made clear that he was standing by Trump.[196] In response to the revelation, Paul Ryan \"uninvited\" Trump from what would have been a joint campaign event. The Trump campaign attempted to substitute Pence for Trump at the event,[197] but according to The New York Times, Pence called Trump on October\u00a08 and told him that he (Pence) would not appear at the event, and that Trump would need to handle the next 48 hours on his own, as Pence did not think he would be an effective surrogate for Trump.[198]\nAccording to Bob Woodward's 2018 book Fear: Trump in the White House, in the midst of the scandal, then-Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus told Trump he should drop out of the race for the good of the party, and that Pence had agreed to replace Trump on the top of the ticket as the Republican presidential nominee, with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice agreeing to be Pence's running mate.[199]\nOn October 10, 2016, Pence appeared on CNN and said, in response to rumors that he was leaving the ticket, that it was \"absolutely false to suggest that at any point in time we considered dropping off this ticket\" and that it is the \"greatest honor of my life\" to be nominated as Trump's running mate.[200]\nOn November 8, 2016, Pence was elected vice president of the United States as Trump's running mate.[201]\n\nVice presidency (2017\u20132021)\nPence being sworn in as vice president by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas on January 20, 2017\nSoon after the election, he was appointed chairman of President-elect Trump's transition team.[202] During the transition phase of the Trump administration, Pence was reported as holding a large degree of influence in the administration due to his roles as a mediator between Trump and congressional Republicans, for reassuring conservatives about Trump's conservative credentials, and his influence in determining Donald Trump's cabinet.[203][204]\n\nInauguration\nFurther information: Inauguration of Donald Trump\nOn January 20, 2017, at noon, Pence became the 48th vice president of the United States, sworn into the office by justice Clarence Thomas, using Reagan's Bible, opened to 2 Chronicles 7:14, \"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land,\" which is the same verse Reagan used for his swearing-ins as governor and president. Pence also used his personal Bible which he opens every morning.[205]\n\nAdvisors and staff\nChief of staff: Marc Short[206]\nNational security advisor: Keith Kellogg[206]\nLegal counsel: Gregory Jacob[206]\nChief of staff to Mrs. Karen Pence: Jana Toner[206]\nDeputy national security advisor: Stephen Pinkos[206]\nDirector of advance: Aaron Chang[206]\nDirector of policy: John Gray[206]\nDirector of public liaison and intergovernmental affairs: Paul Teller[206]\nDeputy director of public liaison and intergovernmental affairs: Andeliz Castillo[206]\nPress secretary: Katie Waldman[206]\nDirector of legislative affairs: Christopher Hodgson[206]\nDeputy director of legislative affairs: Benjamin Cantrell[206]\nDirector of administration and finance: Katherine Purucker[206]\nDirector of scheduling: Bethany Scully[206]\nSpecial assistant: Zach Bauer[206]\nTenure\nSee also: Presidency of Donald Trump\nPence with Trump in 2019\nOn the first day in office (January 20), Pence performed various ceremonial duties, including swearing in Jim Mattis as United States secretary of defense and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security.[207] He also administered the oath of office to the White House senior staff on January 22, 2017.[208]\nPence also sat in on calls made by President Trump to foreign heads of government and state such as Russian president Vladimir Putin[209] and Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.[210][211]\nIn January, Pence appointed Josh Pitcock as his chief of staff, whom he had known from his gubernatorial and congressional days.[212] The following month, Jarrod Agen was tapped as deputy assistant to the president and director of communications to the vice president; his previous job being chief of staff for governor of Michigan Rick Snyder through the time of the Flint water crisis.[213] In July, Pitcock stepped down as chief of staff, and was succeeded in the position by Nick Ayers, another longtime Pence advisor.[214]\nOn February 5, 2017, Pence warned Iran \"not to test the resolve\" of the new Trump administration following their ballistic missile tests.[215]\nOn February 7, 2017, Pence, in his dual constitutional role as president of the United States Senate made the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a Cabinet member.[216][217] He cast the deciding vote to break a fifty-fifty tie to confirm Betsy DeVos as the secretary of education.[218] Pence cast his second tie-breaking vote on March 30, voting to advance a bill to defund Planned Parenthood.[219] In 2018, Pence broke a tie to confirm Jonathan A. Kobes for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This was the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a judicial nominee in U.S. history. In total, Pence had cast 13 tie-breaking votes, seventh-most in history and more than his previous four predecessors (Joe Biden, Dick Cheney, Al Gore and Dan Quayle) cast combined (Cheney broke eight ties, Gore broke four ties, and Quayle and Biden did not cast a tie-breaking vote).\nIn April, Pence made a tour of the Asia-Pacific region. In South Korea, he met acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn and condemned North Korea's latest missile launch.[220][221][222] In Japan, Pence met Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe and pledged to work with Japan, South Korea, and China \"to achieve a peaceable resolution and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\" adding \"The era of strategic patience is over and while all options are on the table.\"[223][224] Pence subsequently traveled to Jakarta, Indonesia, where he met with president Joko Widodo, toured the largest mosque in the region (the Istiqlal Mosque), and praised moderate Islam.[225][226] Pence ended his trip with stops in Sydney, Australia (where, after meeting with Malcolm Turnbull, he said the U.S. \"intends to honor\" a U.S.\u2013Australia refugee resettlement agreement),[227] and Oahu, Hawaii and American Samoa.[228]\nOn May 21, 2017, Pence delivered the commencement address at the University of Notre Dame. Traditionally, the president delivers the address at Notre Dame in his inaugural year, but in 2017 Pence was invited instead when Trump decided to speak at Liberty University.[229][230][231][232]\n\nVice President Mike Pence, Second Lady Karen Pence, and Major General Courtney P. Carr stand for the National Anthem.\nOn June 30, 2017, Pence was appointed chair of the National Space Council after Trump signed an executive order reestablishing the council.[233] As chair, Pence held eight meetings from 2017 to 2020.[234]\nOn October 8, 2017, Pence walked out of a game between the NFL's Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers after members of the 49ers knelt during the national anthem. Shortly afterwards, Pence commented via Twitter, \"President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,\" adding, \"While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the flag and our national anthem.\"[235] Pence was widely criticized by various people for what was considered a publicity stunt. Democratic representative Adam Schiff (CA-28) questioned how much taxpayer's money was used to fund Pence's actions,[236] and CNN later estimated that the total cost of his eight hours of travel on Air Force Two to attend the game was about $242,500, not including ground transportation and security.[237] 49ers safety Eric Reid (the second NFL player after Colin Kaepernick to participate in the protests) told reporters it was predictable that Pence would walk out, knowing that most of the team were protesting.[236] Reid also expressed doubt over the regularity Pence is in terms of attending Colts matches, and referenced a photograph of the vice president and his wife in Colts uniform that had been tweeted before the match,[236] although the official photograph (right) proved otherwise. The photograph in question was first published in 2014.[238] Sportswriter Peter King wrote that the furor surrounding Pence had overshadowed Peyton Manning, who was being honored by the Colts, saying, \"Pence trumped a day that belonged to the greatest football hero the state of Indiana has ever seen, and he did it for political purposes\u00a0... he stole Manning's last great day as a Colt. [He] will have to live with himself for that.\"[236] The following year, Pence reacted positively on Twitter, after NFL owners unanimously decided to approve a new policy requiring all players to stand (or, given the option to stay in the locker room) during the national anthem, despite not consulting the NFL Players Association.[239]\n\nPence with South Korean president Moon Jae-in at the 2018 Winter Olympics\nOn February 1, 2018, it was announced that Pence would lead the presidential delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics, alongside his wife.[240] Much of Pence's time at Pyeongchang was affected by the ongoing North Korean crisis. Prior to the opening ceremony, on February 9, Pence skipped on a dinner held by South Korean president Moon Jae-in, as he would have shared a table with North Korea's ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam.[241] Instead, he met with four North Korean defectors in Pyeongtaek, alongside his special guest, Fred Warmbier (the father of Otto Warmbier, who was arrested in North Korea for attempted theft, and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, before returning to the U.S. in a comatose state).[242][243][244] At the ceremony, the Pences were seated in front of the North Korean delegates, and when North and South Korean athletes entered during the Parade of Athletes, they chose to stay seated, which prompted critics to accuse Pence of hypocrisy in regards to the NFL protests.[245][246] Pence was supposed to meet with the North Koreans on February 10, but they pulled out at the last day.[247]\n\nPence (second from left) during the U.S. military raid on ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on October 26, 2019\nOver the next few months, the North Koreans started communicating more with their neighbors, as Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un secretly met with Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping in March and then Moon Jae-in in an historic inter-Korean summit in April,[248][249] and around the same time, a meeting between Trump and Kim was also proposed. On May 10, Pence accompanied Trump to Andrews Air Force Base as three American citizens were released by North Korea, and in an early morning interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl, he said seeing the men back on American soil \"was really one of the greatest joys of my life\".[250][251] Talks broke down later that month following comments made by Pence and Trump, comparing the situation to events in Libya seven years previous, despite their voluntary disarmament of nuclear weapons in 2003.[252] North Korean vice foreign minister Choe Son-hui called Pence's remarks \"ignorant and stupid\".[253] On May 24, Trump abruptly called off the summit with Pence in attendance,[252] only for him to change his mind a day later,[254] later announcing that it would still be scheduled to take place on June 12 in Singapore.[255]\n\nFormer Vice President and fellow Hoosier Dan Quayle and Marilyn Quayle with Pence in 2019\nIn September 2019, Pence attended official meetings with Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin, Ireland but stayed at President Trump's resort in Doonbeg, 180 miles (290\u00a0km) away. Pence's schedule included four hours spent in transit in one day, and two flights on Air Force Two before the end of the next day. Costs for the limousine service alone totaled $599,000 according to State Department receipts, compared to President Obama's three-day trip to Dublin with the same limousine company totaling $114,000.[256][257]\nIn February 2020, Pence defended debt- and deficit-spending as a measure to stimulate economic growth.[258]\n\nPolitical action committee\nIn May 2017, Pence filed Federal Election Commission paperwork to form Great America Committee, a political action committee (PAC) that would be headed by his former campaign staffers Nick Ayers and Marty Obst.[259][260] Pence is the only vice president to have started his own PAC while still in office.[261] Pence denied a New York Times article's allegations that he would run for president in 2020, calling them \"laughable and absurd\", and said the article was \"disgraceful and offensive\".[262]\n\nPence and the Trump impeachment inquiry\nPence was a key player in the Trump-Ukraine scandal and the Trump impeachment inquiry. Pence had at least two phone conversations and an in-person meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine. Pence met with Zelensky in Poland on September 1, 2019, during an unexpected delay in U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Pence later told the press that he did not mention 2020 presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden to Zelensky, but raised issues regarding Ukrainian corruption.[263]\nAfter the inquiry was opened, Pence publicly stated his support of Trump's call for foreign investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter, saying, \"I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position.\"[264] On October 3, Pence stated, \"My predecessor had a son who was paid $50,000 a month to be on a Ukrainian board at the time that Vice President Biden was leading the Obama administration's efforts in Ukraine, I think [that] is worth looking into.\"[265]\n\nDeath of Soleimani\nPence defended Trump's decision in January 2020 to assassinate the Iranian major general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qasem Soleimani, promoting conspiracy theories that supposedly linked the al-Qaeda attacks on the United States to Iran. In a series of tweets, the vice president termed Soleimani \"an evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans\". Pence insisted Soleimani had \"assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September\u00a011 terrorist attacks\", which critics said was his confusing the number of 9/11 hijackers (actually 19) and insinuating (without evidence) that the general was involved. Many experts responded that Pence's claims were unsubstantiated.[266] Pence's spokeswoman Katie Waldman said that the dozen terrorists Pence referred to were those who had traveled through Afghanistan, ten of whom \"were assisted by Soleimani\".[267]\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nPence and members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force brief the media in March 2020.\nOn February 26, 2020, President Trump named Pence as the leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.[268] Various public health officials and members of Congress had suggested the selection of a \"Coronavirus Czar\", though Trump said that would not be the title's name.[269] As the leader of the task force, Pence coordinated efforts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Department of Homeland Security, and White House Office.[270][271]\nIn April 2020, Pence exempted himself from the Mayo Clinic's policy of wearing a face mask in the hospital during a visit. Pence defended his action, saying he needed to look staff \"in the eye\".[272] The next day, the vice president's opponents criticized him for promoting \"completely irresponsible public health messaging\".[273] Later, Pence acknowledged he should have worn a mask during the hospital visit, and did so two days later when visiting a ventilator production facility.[274]\nIn late June 2020, as coronavirus cases were spiking, Pence gave an optimistic press briefing where he made several misleading and false claims about the state of the coronavirus pandemic.[275][276] He misleadingly argued that surges in cases were the result of increased testing, telling reporters that increases in new cases were \"a reflection of a great success in expanding testing across the country\".[276] However, health experts noted that case growth outpaced the number of tests, and that the share of positive tests was increasing.[277] Pence also falsely claimed that coronavirus fatalities were declining all across the country (Statistics here), that the curve had been flattened, and that all 50 states were opening up.[276] In private meetings with Republican Senators, Pence urged them to focus on \"encouraging signs\". Pence told the senators that cases were increasing in only 3% of counties and 12 states; however, data at the time showed that cases were increasing in at least 5% of counties and in at least 20 states.[278] On December 18, the Pences received the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, in front of a live audience at a televised event to show Americans that the vaccine is safe and effective.[279][280][281]\n\n2020 vice presidential election\nSee also: Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign and 2020 United States presidential election\nAhead of his presidential campaign on February 28, 2019, Joe Biden referred to Pence as a \"decent guy\" in a speech in Omaha, Nebraska, when making an anecdote about an audience falling silent after Pence mentioned Trump's name. Biden later faced criticism for his complimentary remarks due to Pence's alleged anti-LGBT positions, which Biden would later apologize for and clarify by saying, \"I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn't be given a silent reaction on the world stage.\" Biden had previously referred to Pence as a \"decent guy\" in 2018, and Pence and Biden exchanged conversations via phone before Pence's 2017 transition into the vice presidency.[282]\nIn June 2019, the Democratic former New York City Council president Andrew Stein opined that Trump could improve his re-election chances by replacing Pence as his running mate with former South Carolina governor and former United States ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.[283] Despite that, Trump said Pence will be his running mate. He declined to endorse Pence should his running mate seek in 2024 to succeed him, but said he would give it \"very strong consideration\".[284]\nIn remarks about law enforcement during the 2020 Republican convention, Pence said a federal security officer, Dave Underwood, \"was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland\", implying he was killed by rioters, when instead a man linked to the far-right Boogaloo movement had exploited the unrest as a cover for murder.[285][286][287]\nOn October 7, 2020, Pence participated in a debate with Kamala Harris that was held by USA Today in Salt Lake City, Utah, and moderated by Susan Page, the Washington bureau chief of the newspaper. The debate was held with adaptations designed to avoid contagion of the COVID-19 virus given that the vice president had been in close contact with people who had been infected at a recent event at the White House. Plexiglas partitions separated the candidates and masks were required for all attending except the candidates and moderator.[288][a] By some estimates, Pence interrupted Harris twice as much as she interrupted him.[289] Media outlets noted that near the end of the debate, a fly landed on Pence's head for almost two minutes.[290][291] A CNN poll found that 59% of registered voters felt that Harris had won the debate, while 38% felt that Pence had.[289]\nOn November 7, 2020, after several days of vote counting, Biden and Harris were declared by most major news networks to be the winners of the election.[292] On December 14 the Electoral College confirmed the win, giving the Biden-Harris campaign 306 votes compared to 232 for the Trump\u2013Pence campaign,[293] however, Trump refused to concede and insisted that he had actually won. Throughout November and December Trump and his campaign filed more than 50 lawsuits alleging election fraud and other irregularities; all of them were eventually rejected by judges.[294] \nTrump also pressured Republican officials, lawmakers and even the Justice Department to take actions to overturn the election.[295]\nIn late December 2020, a federal lawsuit was filed against Pence by Republican congressman Louie Gohmert and 11 Arizona Republicans who would have become presidential electors had Trump actually won Arizona. The plaintiffs sought to give the vice president the power to reject state certified presidential electors in favour of \"competing slates of electors\" so that Biden's victory over Trump could be overturned.[296][297][298] The United States Department of Justice represented Pence in this case, and argued for its dismissal, stating that the lawsuit was a \"walking legal contradiction\" because it sought to grant power to the vice president, while suing the vice president.[298] Within a week, the lawsuit was dismissed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, and the appeal was rejected by a United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit panel, both due to the plaintiffs' lack of standing.[299] Gohmert then appealed to the Supreme Court, which on January\u00a07 tersely \"denied\" his petition.[300]\n\nVote counting and storming of the Capitol\nMain article: January 6 United States Capitol attack\nIn January 2021, Trump began to pressure Pence to take action to overturn the election. As vice president, Pence presided over the January 6, 2021, Congressional Joint Session to count the electoral votes\u2014normally a non-controversial, ceremonial event. For days beforehand, Trump declared both in public and in private that Pence should use that position to overturn the election results in swing states and declare Trump\u2013Pence the winners of the election.[301] Pence demurred that the United States constitution did not give him that power, but Trump falsely insisted that \"The Vice President and I are in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act.\"[302] \nAccording to The New York Times, multiple sources claim that Trump called Pence before he departed to certify the results urging him again one last time ultimately telling him, \"You can either go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy.\"[303] \nBefore the start of the Joint Session, Pence stated in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter that the Constitution prevented him from deciding which electoral votes counted and which did not.[304]\nOn January 6, 2021, the day on which a joint session of Congress met to count and certify the results of the electoral college for the 2020 presidential election, Trump held a rally at which he urged listeners to go to the Capitol and repeatedly expressed the hope that Pence would \"do the right thing\".[305] Many listeners then marched to the Capitol and stormed it. A Reuters photographer overheard three rioters saying they wanted to seize Pence and hang him, while many others chanted their desire to hang Pence.[306][307][308][309]\nOn January 15, The Washington Post reported that Pence came \"dangerously close\" to the rioters during their occupation of the Capitol. Pence was not evacuated from the Senate chambers until 14 minutes after the initial breach of the Capitol was reported. He and his family were eventually ushered from the Senate chambers into a second-floor hideaway. One minute later, the mob rushed onto a stair landing only 100 feet away, from which they could have seen him enter the room if they had arrived a minute earlier.[310] After his evacuation from the Senate chambers, his Secret Service detail wanted to move him away from the Capitol building but he refused to get in the car.[311] Pence later approved the deployment of the National Guard, which raised questions as the vice president is not the commander-in-chief.[312][313] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session, and officially certified the election results with Pence declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[307]\n\nPence and his wife Karen at the inauguration of Joe Biden\nDuring the siege, Trump criticized Pence as lacking \"courage\".[314] Earlier L. Lin Wood, a lawyer associated with Trump, had called for Pence to be \"executed\" by \"firing squad\".[315][316] In spite of the threats against Pence, Trump never reached out to Pence or inquired about his safety during the attack on the Capitol, according to sources close to the vice president.[317][318] Aides believed that Pence was being set up as a scapegoat for Trump's failure to overturn the results of the election.[319] Pence was described as very angry with Trump.[320] The two did not speak for several days, until January 11 when they met at the White House to discuss the prior week's Capitol siege and the final days of their administration.[321]\nOn January 20, Pence attended the inauguration of Joe Biden as president of the United States, unlike Trump. Afterwards, he left the Capitol with his successor, Kamala Harris.[322]\n\nPost-vice presidency (2021\u2013present)\nPence did not have a permanent place of residence in Indiana when he left the vice presidency. Official records indicated that Pence had not owned a residence in Indiana since 2013, having lived in the governor's mansion and then the vice president's residence in Washington. As a result, for several months after leaving office, he and his wife stayed at residences owned by various Indiana Republican politicians. It is believed that he was at one time staying in a cabin owned by his former lieutenant governor, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb.[323][324] In May 2021, the Pences bought a home in Carmel, Indiana.[325]\nIn February 2021, it was announced that Pence would join The Heritage Foundation as a distinguished visiting fellow.[326] He also joined the Young America's Foundation conservative youth organization, with plans to launch a new podcast with the group in the coming months.[327] In March 2021, Pence published an op-ed on a Heritage Foundation website in which he noted \"significant voting irregularities and numerous instances of officials setting aside state election law\" during the 2020 election.[328] At speaking engagements in the months after the end of the Trump administration, Pence spoke with reverence of the former president.[329]\n\nPence speaking to an audience in Nebraska City in September 2021\nPence narrated a four-part television series on the career of right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh titled Age of Rush, which debuted on Fox Nation in March 2021.[330] Pence had previously cited Limbaugh as an inspiration for his career in talk radio and then in politics.[331] In April 2021, it was reported that Pence signed a deal with publisher Simon & Schuster for two books, including an autobiography that is set to be published in 2023.[332]\nThe day the Supreme Court overturned Roe in June 2022, Pence told Breitbart News: \"Roe v. Wade has been consigned to the ash heap of history...Having been given this second chance for life, we must not rest and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the land.\"[333]\nPence appeared in the July 2022 documentary Unprecedented.[334]\nIn October 2022, Pence condemned \"unprincipled populism\" and \"Putin apologists\" in the Republican Party.[335]\nSince leaving the vice presidency, Pence has distanced himself from Trump's attempts to cast doubt on the 2020 presidential election and made high-profile speeches in early nominating states.[336] Pence has also separated himself from Trump by endorsing candidates in several Republican primary elections in opposition to the candidate endorsed by Trump.[337] In the primary for governor of Georgia, Pence endorsed incumbent governor Brian Kemp over the Trump-backed candidate, former senator David Perdue. This was described as \"a proxy battle\" between Pence and Trump, with Pence's candidate Kemp winning the nomination easily.[336] In the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial election, Pence endorsed Karrin Taylor Robson while Trump endorsed Kari Lake. In the 2022 Wisconsin gubernatorial election Pence endorsed former Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch; Trump supported businessman Tim Michels.[338]\nOn February 9, 2023, it was reported that Pence had been subpoenaed by special counsel Jack Smith regarding the attack on the Capitol, following months of negotiation between Pence's attorneys and the special counsel.[339][340] After several unsuccessful challenges to the subpoena by Pence's lawyers and by Trump himself, Pence testified before the grand jury on April 27, 2023, saying \"We'll obey the law, we'll tell the truth.\"[341]\nThe same day as the subpoena was reported, Pence released a statement expressing support for \"parental rights\", especially regarding how teachers treat children who express different gender identities, which he described as left-wing efforts \"to indoctrinate our children behind parents' backs.\" The statement was released through Advancing American Freedom, a communications group he founded in 2021 with political donations.[342]\n\nClassified documents investigation\nMain article: Mike Pence classified documents incident\nIn January 2023, after classified documents were found at the home of President Joe Biden, Pence asked his lawyer to search his home \"out of an abundance of caution\". The attorney found around a dozen documents marked as classified in Pence's Indiana home and turned over the documents to the FBI. The discovery came after Pence had repeatedly said that he did not have classified documents.[343] Pence has taken responsibility for the documents and said that he was unaware of his possession of them. The FBI and the Justice Department's National Security Division reviewed the incident. Pence indicated he would \"fully cooperate\".[344] On February 10, the FBI searched his home.[345] In June, the Department of Justice notified Pence that its investigation had ended and that no charges would be brought forward.[346]\n\n2024 presidential campaign\nMain article: Mike Pence 2024 presidential campaign\nPence greeting supporters in Iowa, July 2023\nPolls of Republicans in 2021 regarding their preferred presidential candidate in 2024 implied that Pence could begin a campaign as a top-tier candidate if former President Trump were to forgo a run.[347][348] At the same time, said polling also foretold a precipitous decline in Pence's polling numbers if Trump were to seek the presidency again.[349] In light of this, there was a widespread view among both Republican leaders and grassroots Republicans that \"Pence is dead in the early waters of 2024.\"[350]\nIn May 2022, The New York Times reported that Pence was considering a presidential run regardless of whether Trump decided to run for a second term.[336]\nIn 2023, Pence criticized former President Donald Trump, especially regarding the events that took place on January 6, 2021. While speaking at a Gridiron dinner, an event attended by politicians and journalists, Pence said that Trump was wrong to suggest that Pence had a right to overturn the election results. Pence went further, saying that Trump's words not only endangered him, but his family and everyone at the Capitol. Much of the rhetoric was believed to be a lead-up to Pence's potential run for the Republican nomination heading into the 2024 presidential election.[351]\nOn June 5, 2023, Pence filed paperwork and officially launched his bid for the presidency.[352] In July, Pence became the first 2024 Republican presidential candidate to visit Ukraine, where he met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[353]\nOn October 28, Pence, who had weak fundraising and poll numbers, withdrew from the race. Much of his campaigning had taken place in Iowa.[354]\n\nPersonal life\nMike and Karen Pence with their children and daughter-in-law at the 2017 Presidential Inauguration Parade\nPence and his wife, Karen (n\u00e9e Batten), met while he was in law school at Indiana University.[14] They were married in 1985. Pence's father died in 1988, leaving his mother a widow with four grown children and two teenagers. Mike and Karen Pence have three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.[355][356] Michael Pence is a first lieutenant and pilot in the United States Marine Corps.[357][358][359] During Pence's service in the House, his family lived in Arlington, Virginia when Congress was in session and in Columbus, Indiana, during recesses.[8][18] During an interview in 2002, Pence told a reporter that he would not have dinner alone with a woman other than his wife.[360] On May 1, 2004, Pence's mother remarried \u2013 this time to Basil Coolidge Fritsch, a widower since 2001.[361][362] In 2018, Pence's oldest brother, Greg, entered and won the political race to represent Indiana's 6th congressional district in Congress (the seat previously held by Mike).[363][364] Greg and Mike are similar enough in appearance that Greg once successfully acted as a decoy to lure the press away from his brother when Mike Pence was being touted as a potential running mate to Donald Trump.[365][366]\nIn 2016 he was diagnosed with asymptomatic left bundle branch block.[367][368] In April 2021, Pence underwent surgery for a pacemaker implant due to a slow heartbeat.[369][370]\nThe family's pet rabbit, Marlon Bundo, was the subject of a children's book authored by Pence's daughter, Charlotte.[371]\n\nReligion\nPence was raised in a Catholic family, was as an altar server, and attended parochial school.[42][372] He became a born-again Christian in college, while a member of a nondenominational Christian student group, and identified his first year\u2014and specifically \"a Christian music festival in Asbury, Kentucky, in the spring of 1978\"[373] referring to the Ichthus Music Festival at then Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky\u2014as the moment he made a \"commitment to Christ\".[42][372] After that point, Pence continued to attend Mass (where he met his wife) and was a Catholic youth minister.[372] Pence called himself Catholic in a 1994 news piece, although by 1995, he and his family had joined an evangelical megachurch, the Grace Evangelical Church.[42][372] In 2013, Pence said his family was \"kind of looking for a church\".[42] In 2016, Pence and his wife regularly worshiped at College Park Church, a nondenominational church in Indianapolis.[14] He has described himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order\", and as \"a born-again, Evangelical Catholic\".[42][372] As one commentator put it, \"Pence doesn't simply wear his faith on his sleeve\u2014he wears the entire Jesus jersey.\"[14]\n\nPence At Taylor University In 2019\nIn a 2002 statement on the floor of the House of Representatives (reported in the Congressional Record), Pence told his colleagues \"...\u00a0I also believe that someday scientists will come to see that only the theory of intelligent design provides even a remotely rational explanation for the known universe.\"[374][375] When asked by Chris Matthews in 2009 if he believed in evolution, Pence said \"I believe with all my heart that God created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that is in them. How he did that, I'll ask him about some day.\"[376][377]\n\nPublications\nPence, Mike (2022). So Help Me God. New York: Simon & Schuster.
