Prior to becoming Surgeon General, he served as the Indiana state health commissioner, from 2014 to 2017.\nOn June 29, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Adams to become Surgeon General of the United States.[4][5] Adams was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 3, 2017.[6] Adams' tenure as Surgeon General coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.[7]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nAdams is the son of Richard and Edrena Adams of Mechanicsville, Maryland, and grew up on the family farm. He attended Chopticon High School, graduating in 1992, in the top 5% of his class.[8]  He then attended the University of Maryland Baltimore County through a full-tuition Meyerhoff Scholarship, a grant dedicated to minority students interested in the sciences.[9] Adams received his Bachelor of Science in biochemistry and his Bachelor of Arts in biopsychology. Additionally, Adams studied abroad in the Netherlands and Zimbabwe.[10]\nAdams attended medical school at Indiana University School of Medicine as an Eli Lilly and Company Scholar.[9] He also received a  Master of Public Health degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2000, with a focus on chronic disease prevention.[11] Adams completed his internship in internal medicine (2002\u20132003) at St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital and his residency in anesthesiology (2003\u20132006) at Indiana University. He is board certified in anesthesiology.[12]\n\nCareer[edit]\nPrivate practice and academia[edit]\nAfter two years in private practice at Ball Memorial Hospital,[13][14] Adams was named assistant professor of anesthesiology at Indiana University.[15][16] He has written several academic papers and book chapters, including chapters in Anesthesia Student Survival Guide: A Case-based Approach,[17] and an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health, \"Are Pain Management Questions in Patient Satisfaction Surveys Driving the Opioid Epidemic?\"[18]\n\nIndiana state health commissioner[edit]\nIn October 2014, Adams was appointed Indiana state health commissioner. He was originally appointed by Governor Mike Pence and re-appointed by newly elected governor Eric Holcomb in 2017.[19] In this role, he oversaw the Public Health Protection and Laboratory Services, Health and Human Services, Health Care Quality and Regulatory, and Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Commissions. He also served as Secretary of Indiana State Department of Health's executive board, as Chairman of the Indiana State Trauma Care Committee, as President of the Healthy Hoosier Foundation, and as co-chairman of the Indiana Perinatal Quality Improvement Collaborative Governing Council.[15] During an HIV epidemic in 2015, Adams initially opposed needle-exchange programs on \"moral\" grounds, but he later changed his position as cases continued to mount.[20]\n\nSurgeon General of the United States[edit]\nU.S. vice president Mike Pence swearing in Adams as U.S. Surgeon General on September 5, 2017.\nOn June 29, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Adams as surgeon general of the United States.[4] He was confirmed to the position by the Senate on August 3, 2017.[21] Upon his confirmation, Adams said that addressing the opioid epidemic along with untreated mental illness would be two of his major priorities.[6]  Adams was sworn in as surgeon general on September 5, 2017,[22] and received his commission shortly after.\nIn April 2018, Adams urged Americans who are at risk of overdosing on opioids, as well as their family and friends, to carry an over-the-counter antidote to help combat rising fatalities.[23][24] In May 2018, Adams responded to an in-flight medical emergency on a flight to Jackson, Mississippi.[25]\nIn September 2018, Adams began a campaign along with other public health officials to promote seasonal flu vaccinations. The 2017 flu epidemic had resulted in the deaths of an estimated 80,000 Americans, the highest number of deaths in at least four decades, according to CDC director Robert Redfield. Of the 180 children who died, 80 percent were unvaccinated.[26]\n[6]\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic[edit]\nAdams speaking to the White House press corps on COVID-19 in March 2020.\nIn February 2020, Adams was appointed to the task force for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.[27] Adams initially downplayed the risk from COVID-19 by comparing it to the flu, which was criticized by experts.[28][29] He also strongly implored people not to buy or use face masks because he said they were \u201cNOT effective\u201d in preventing the general public from catching COVID-19,[30][31] and that wearing a mask could actually increase the risk of catching the virus.[32] This was in line with other health experts, including Anthony Fauci, who were working on limited information at the time.\nAdams later retracted this recommendation because he said there was new information about the asymptomatic spread of the virus.[33][34] Politico reported in April 2020 that Adams had been largely sidelined by the administration.[7]\nWhen asked about African-Americans\u2019 increased risks from COVID, Adams replied that \u201cAfrican-Americans and Latinos should avoid alcohol, drugs and tobacco. Do it for your abuela, do it for your granddaddy, do it for your big momma, do it for your pop-pop.\u201d Public health experts criticized his assertions as misleading and lacking adequate context.[35]\nAdams expressed concern that the George Floyd protests could lead to a spike in COVID-19 cases. According to Adams, \"Based on the way the disease spreads, there is every reason to expect that we will see new clusters and potentially new outbreaks moving forward.\"[36]\nAdams confirmed that he was asked to step down as Surgeon General by the incoming Biden administration. Former surgeon general Vivek Murthy took his place.[37] He officially resigned on January 20, 2021, at the request of President Joe Biden.[38]\n\nSubsequent career[edit]\nFollowing his service as surgeon general, Adams joined Purdue University in October 2021 as a Presidential Fellow and its first executive director of health equity initiatives, professor of practice in the departments of Pharmacy Practice and Public Health, and a faculty member of the Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering.[39] Having been part of the Trump administration, he described how this made it difficult to obtain a position in academia or the corporate world.[40]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAdams is Catholic, and he and his wife Lacey have three children.[41][42]\n\nAwards and decorations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Medical Readiness Badge\n\n\nPublic Health Service Distinguished Service Medal[43]\n\nPublic Health Service Outstanding Service Medal\n\nPublic Health Service Presidential Unit Citation[44]\n\n\nPublic Health Service Outstanding Unit Citation\n\nPublic Health Service Unit Commendation\n\nPublic Health Service Global Health Campaign Medal\n\n\nHumanitarian Service Medal\n\nPublic Health Service Regular Corps Ribbon\n\nCommissioned Corps Training Ribbon\n\n\nSurgeon General Badge\n\nOffice of the Secretary of Health and Human Services Badge\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Pence names Adams Indiana's health commissioner\".

    "wiki": "Gerald \"Jerry\" Bowyer (born 1962)[1] is an American investment manager, author, and columnist. He is a former radio and broadcasting host who has also been extensively involved in public affairs, political writing, and investment activities.\n\n\nEarly career[edit]\nBowyer, an accountant at the time,[1] began what his biography calls his \"first professional position\" in 1990 at Arthur Andersen, then one of the six largest accounting firms in the United States. He left the firm in 1993 to work briefly as the vice president of the Beechwood Company, the holding company for Federated Investors, a mutual fund business.[2]\n\nMedia[edit]\nBowyer started in broadcast media in 1993 as the host of WPIT-FM\u2019s Cross-Town Perspectives program.[2] Beginning in October 1999, he hosted The Jerry Bowyer Program on WPTT radio in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a live 3-hour program focusing on business, politics and current events. He left WPTT in July 2005.[3]\nBeginning in September 2005, Bowyer was the host on an afternoon show on Christian talk radio station WORD-FM in Pittsburgh.[2] He left in February 2006 after suffering chest pains after cross-country skiing.  Bowyer posted a message to listeners citing an ongoing stress-related illness and the need to scale back.[4]\nBowyer has also been on many television programs.  He is the former host of religious broadcaster Cornerstone TeleVision\u2019s syndicated program Focus on the Issues.[2]  He also previously hosted Pennsylvania Newsmakers, a public affairs television program that airs through much of Pennsylvania.[5]\nBowyer is also the former host of WorldView, a Sunday-morning political talk show that is syndicated on approximately 2 dozen TV stations.  In his bio, Bowyer mentions interviews done for the show that include those of Vice President Dick Cheney; Lynne Cheney, the Vice President\u2019s wife; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; Presidential advisor Karl Rove; former Attorney General Edwin Meese; and publisher and former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes.[2]\nBowyer has also been a guest on television programs, and has received criticism for statements surrounding universal healthcare potentially being exploited as vulnerability to terrorism.[6]\n\nPublic affairs and political writing[edit]\nIn 1993, Bowyer was the founding president of the Allegheny Institute for Public Policy.[2] The institute's \"political arm\" was the Allegheny Institute Taxpayer Coalition.[7] In January 1997, the Pittsburgh Business Times reported that the \"views of [Bowyer's] conservative think tank, the Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, were informally adopted last year by the newly elected Republican county commission majority.\"[1]\nThe institute was launched by Richard Mellon Scaife[8] and has been funded in large part by the various Scaife Foundations;[1] of the $3.8 million in grants to the Institute between 1995 and 2005, more than $3.5 million came from four of those foundations.[9]\nBowyer resigned as head of the institute in early 2001 to spend more time with his radio and television activities.  He was succeeded by Jake Haulk, PhD, a long-time employee of the institute.[10]\nBowyer is the author of The Bush Boom: How a Misunderestimated President Fixed a Broken Economy, published by Allegiance Press in October 2003,[11] and The Free Market Capitalist's Survival Guide: How to Invest and Thrive in an Era of Rampant Socialism, published by HarperCollins in February 2011.[12]\nHe is a weekly contributor to Forbes.com,[13] and an occasional contributor to Forbes magazine.[14] He also occasionally contributes to The Wall Street Journal.[15]\n\nBusiness interests[edit]\nBowyer was chairman of the board of Impact Total Return Portfolio, a mutual fund.[2] (also known as \"IMPACT Management Investment Trust\").[16]  He was an economic advisor to Independence Portfolio Partners [2] and a member of the investment committee of Blue Vase Capital Management.[17] He was also a director of Gundaker/Jordan American Holdings, a financial services company, from May 2001[18] until late 2002.[19]\nBowyer is the founder of Newsmakers Leadership Group,[20] \"a research and media company targeted at leaders\", and its research and consulting arm, Verity Research & Media.  Verity produces the Pennsylvania Newsmakers show, and does other research and media work.[2]  He is also the chairman of Bowyer Media,[21] a company specializing in radio and television production, print and internet publishing, and economic analysis.[22]\nJerry Bowyer is an economist for the Ronald Blue & Co. Investment Policy Committee, where he has helped to develop an approach to economics and investment known as Principled Reasoning.[23] Principled Reasoning seeks to replace predominant academic models for portfolio risk assessment which are based on variability or volatility[24] with models based on adherence with certain fundamental principles of human flourishing. According to a Principled Reasoning approach to risk, when nations violate fundamental principles they add inherent risk to their investment climate requiring higher risk premiums in valuations in order to compensate for the higher risk level.\n\nPersonal[edit]\nBowyer graduated from Robert Morris University.  He lives in Boston, Pennsylvania, with his wife, Susan.  The two have home-schooled their seven children.[21][25]\nIn the early 1990s, Bowyer was the executive director of the National Reform Association, an organization with close ties to the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America,[1][2]. He called for creation of a \"theocracy\" in America: \"Christocracy, the rule of Christ over the nation,\" he called it once, according to a 1999 Washington Post article.[8] Bowyer changed his position on religion and state in the mid 90s and frequently asserted his disagreements with the religious right and agreements with the position of the founding fathers on his radio program.[citation needed]\nBowyer has previously blogged on crosswalk.com, a \"Christ-centered, for-profit corporation\",[26] and is an Anglican Vestryman.[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d Dan Fitzpatrick, \"Allegheny County: a poster child for privatization?

A 2013 column for The Guardian, \"Why should married women change their names? Let men change theirs\", was cited as recommended reading on the social construction of gender in Critical Encounters in Secondary English: Teaching Literacy Theory to Adolescents by Deborah Appleman (2014).[25][26] Filipovic married Ty Lohrer McCormick in 2018, and kept her last name.[27][28]\n\nDomestic violence and asylum[edit]\nFilipovic has criticized Jeff Sessions' directive to refuse grants of asylum to women fleeing domestic violence. She emphasized that women who suffer domestic violence in places where the government refuses to protect them are being persecuted. She stated: \"Sessions, because of his deep antipathy toward immigrants and his misogynistic worldview that domestic violence is a private family matter, has undercut this promise of safe harbor \u2013 and taken a law meant for protection and turned it into a cudgel of sexist cruelty.\"[29]\nShe has also written about how the prohibition of abortion in Honduras drives women who are victims of sexual violence to migrate from the country.[30]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nFilipovic is of Serbian and German descent through her father's side of the family.[31][32] She married journalist Ty McCormick in 2018.[27][28]\n\nAwards[edit]\n2015 Society of Professional Journalists Sigma Delta Chi Award, best online column writing[33]\n2015 Planned Parenthood Federation of America Maggie Award for Media Excellence for best TV and online reporting[34]\n2014 Society of Professional Journalists Sigma Delta Chi Award, best online column writing[35]\n2014 Newswomen's Club of New York Front Page Award for opinion/ criticism[36]\nBibliography[edit]\nFilipovic, Jill (2008), \"Offensive feminism: the conservative gender norms that perpetuate rape culture, and how feminists can fight back\", in Jaclyn Friedman; Jessica Valenti (eds.), Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and A World Without Rape, Seal Press, ISBN\u00a09780786727056\nFilipovic, Jill (2017), The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness, Nation Books, ISBN\u00a0978-1568585475\nFilipovic, Jill (2020), OK Boomer, Let's Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind, Simon and Schuster, ISBN\u00a0978-1982153762\nSee also[edit]\nNew Yorkers in journalism\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Filipovic 2013.\n\n^ Filipovic, Jill (March 27, 2017). \"Opinion | The All-Male Photo Op Isn't a Gaffe.

HodgesPolitical partyDemocraticSpouse\nJohn Arthur\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a02013; died\u00a02013)\u200b\nJames Obergefell (/\u02c8o\u028ab\u0259r\u0261\u0259f\u025bl/ OH-b\u0259r-g\u0259-fel; born July 7, 1966) is an American civil rights activist who was the lead plaintiff in the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage throughout the United States.[1] Obergefell had sued the state of Ohio in 2013, due to that state's lack of legal recognition of Obergefell's marriage to his husband, John Arthur(1967\u20132013).[2] Obergefell was the Democratic nominee for the 89th legislative district of the Ohio House of Representatives in the 2022 elections.[3]\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nJames Obergefell[4][5] was born on July 7, 1966.[6][7]\nObergefell graduated from Sandusky High School in 1984[8] and went on to attend the University of Cincinnati, where he earned a degree in secondary education and German.[9] He attended graduate school at Bowling Green State University.[9] Out of college, he was a high school German teacher.[9] In his mid-twenties, Obergefell came out to his eldest sister.[1] At the time, his mother was dead, but the rest of his family was not too surprised by his announcement.[1] While his father was not always supportive, Obergefell found a strong relationship with his aunt Paulette.[10]\n\nObergefell v. Hodges case Obergefell began to attend an Episcopal Church but later declared himself an atheist.[11]\nCourt cases[edit]\nIn 2011, Obergefell's longtime partner John Arthur was diagnosed with ALS.[1] In July 2013, Obergefell and a gravely ill Arthur were legally married in Maryland. However, after meeting with Al Gerhardstein, a civil rights attorney, they were told that due to Ohio's same-sex marriage ban, Obergefell could not be listed as Arthur's surviving spouse on his death certificate.[1]\nThey filed a lawsuit, and the Ohio case became known as Obergefell v. Kasich.[12] A federal judge agreed to hear the case the following court day due to Arthur's illness.[13] The judge ruled in Obergefell's favor, but the state of Ohio appealed to a higher court and won, resulting in Obergefell's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.[1] Arthur died in October 2013, and soon Obergefell devoted his time and became committed to legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide with the Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges.\nThe two questions that would drive Obergefell's appeal to court would be: 1) whether it was constitutional for states to discriminate between gay and straight couples in granting marriage licenses, and 2) whether the Constitution required every state to recognize legal marriages of same sex couples who were married in another state.[14] Obergefell v. Hodges was decided on Friday, June 26, 2015, with five of the nine Supreme Court justices ruling in Obergefell's favor.[14] Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion for the case, stated in the court: \u201cNo union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were.\u201d[15] After winning the case, Obergefell stated, \"It affirms what millions across the country already know to be true in their hearts: our love is equal.[14] The four words etched onto the front of the Supreme Court 'equal justice under law' apply to us, too.\"[14] President Barack Obama reached out to congratulate Obergefell and thanked him for \"his leadership that has changed our country.\"[14]\n\nMedia appearances[edit]\nWhen Justice Kennedy retired in 2018, Obergefell was very vocal in the media on his opinions of the judge's decision to resign. Obergefell admitted to feeling \"despondent\" because he believed the loss of Justice Kennedy could have repercussions, especially for the LGBTQ+ community.[16] Obergefell believes Justice Kennedy's legacy was undermined by his decision to retire during a Trump presidency. Obergefell stated on the issue that \"I wouldn't trust any Justice nominated by this president to respect and protect LGBTQ+ rights.\"[17] Obergefell also was in the press when he was invited by Michelle Obama to attend Obama's final State of the Union address. When asked about why he received the honor to sit in the box of the First Lady, Obergefell said: \"We the People. This core American belief is why the other marriage-equality plaintiffs and I, and so many others before us, stood up to fight for our rights.\"[18]\n\nCareer[edit]\nPrior to his experience in court, Obergefell was a consultant and realtor in Ohio.[19] He consulted along with his partner Arthur.[19] After the case won in the Supreme Court in 2015, Obergefell spent a year traveling around the globe to speak about the case and his own life.[9] Obergefell has made it clear he did not take his case to court for financial reasons. According to Obergefell, federal recognition of his marriage means he would only receive $255 in additional Social Security benefits and potentially a small disability benefit when he retires.[20]\nObergefell cofounded Equality Vines after the trial, the first cause-based wine label that supports organizations devoted to civil rights and equality for all. He works with Keppler Speakers as a speaker and an activist.[21] He also co-authored the book Love Wins (2017) with Debbie Cenziper. The book explores the lives of the lovers and lawyers who were essential to the victory of Obergefell v. Hodges. Obergefell volunteers to officiate weddings, having officiated at eight same-sex weddings and one opposite-sex wedding after winning his case.[17]\nIn February 2016, soon after the court ruling, Obergefell moved to Washington, D.C., to continue pursuing his political endeavors.[22] After three years of activism in Washington, Obergefell decided, in 2019, to move back to Ohio to reclaim his roots, return to his role as an uncle to 17, and announce a new act.[22] When asked about his favorite memory from his time in D.C., Obergefell said, \"To be in that courtroom and have it finally sink in as Justice Kennedy [read] the decision that we won, and that John could finally rest in peace. And that people like us around the country could get married, it's hard to top that.\"[22] In a 2019 interview with Washington DC-based station WUSA (TV), Obergefell said he was looking forward to working on advancing LGBT and minority rights on a state level, starting with his home state of Ohio, since additional federal progress didn't seem attainable at the time.[22]\nIn January of 2022, Jim Obergefell ran for the Ohio House of Representatives for Ohio's 89th legislative district covering Erie, Huron, and Ottawa counties.[23] In the August 2022 Democratic primaries, Obergefell ran unopposed and won.[24] He was defeated by Republican incumbent D. J. Swearingen, who won re-election.[25]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn the early 1990s, at Uncle Woody's, a bar near the University of Cincinnati, Obergefell met John Arthur, the man he would eventually marry.[1] They began dating, moved in together, and worked in IT consulting and client relations management at several companies. After years of being together, Arthur was diagnosed with ALS.[1] Obergefell acted as Arthur's caretaker for the rest of their relationship. By 2013, Arthur became bed bound, and Obergefell and Arthur decided to get married.[1] Same-sex marriage was illegal in their home state of Ohio, so in order to get married, they would have to go to another state.[14] Close friends and family of the couple pooled together to rent a medically equipped plane for the couple to travel for their wedding.[19] On July 11, 2013, the couple got an ambulance to escort Arthur to a private plane that flew Arthur, Obergefell, a nurse, and Arthur's aunt, who performed the ceremony, to Baltimore/Washington International Airport in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, where the marriage ceremony was performed while the plane sat on the tarmac.[26] After 22 years of being together, Arthur died on October 22, 2013.[27]\n\nRecognition[edit]\nIn 2016, the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati honored Obergefell with the Everyday Freedom Hero award. The award is given to people whose actions reflect the ideals of the underground railroad.[28] The city council of Cincinnati made April 28, the day of the Oral Arguments, John Arthur Day as a tribute to the Supreme Court case from the two men who lived there together for two decades. The mayor of the city, John Cranley, referred to Obergefell as a \"historic figure\" for their city and the country.[29] In 2015, Foreign Policy named Obergefell one of its 2015 Global Thinkers. In the same year, Out magazine also named Obergefell on its 2015 Out 100 list. Obergefell was also appointed to be a member of the National Advisory Board for the GLBT Historical Society and the Board of Advisors for the Mattachine Society of Washington DC.[17] Obergefell has also been honored by the ACLU of Southern California, the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, and the Santa Clara University School of Law.[30]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i Rosenwald, Michael (April 6, 2015). \"How Jim Obergefell became the face of the Supreme Court gay marriage case\".

In 1987, she and her husband Wes Boyd co-founded Berkeley Systems, a San Francisco Bay area software company that marketed the popular After Dark screensaver and the You Don't Know Jack trivia game. After selling Berkeley Systems in 1997 for $13.8 million, Blades and Boyd founded the liberal political group MoveOn.org.[3]\nBlades received her B.A. in History from UC Berkeley in 1977 and her J.D. from the Golden Gate University School of Law. She wrote the book Mediate Your Divorce[4] (published by Prentice Hall), and co-wrote The Divorce Book.[5] She was a member of the board and vice president of marketing at Berkeley Systems. Blades created many of the box designs for the early Berkeley Systems products such as Stepping Out and After Dark, based on her original collage art.\nIn 2006, Blades and Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner co-authored The Motherhood Manifesto[6] and co-founded the organization MomsRising.org, dedicated to \"bringing millions of people, who all share a common concern about the need to build a more family-friendly America, together as a non-partisan force.\"\nIn 2010, Blades and Nanette Fondas co-authored The Custom-Fit Workplace,[7] published by Wiley. A practical guide for making the workplace more profitable and a better fit for employees, the book describes work practices like flexible work, virtual work, high-commitment work, non-linear career paths and babies at work. MomsRising.org[7] launched a companion to the book on Labor Day 2010 to encourage supporters of custom-fit work environments to join the conversation about transforming work culture.\nIn 2011, Blades co-founded Living Room Conversations[8] in an effort to bring both sides of the political spectrum together to discuss individual issues in a comfortable environment. Based on six basic rules of discourse,[9] Blades hosted a Living Room Conversation with Tea Party Patriots co-founder Mark Meckler and was featured in the SF Chronicle.[10]  This led to further work on criminal justice reform and the formation of the Coalition for Public Safety.[11] Over 25 Living Room Conversations topics are available for public use, ranging from food to guns to voting and more; they are regularly featured on Huffington Post.[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Joan Ellen Blades # 96893 - Attorney Licensee Search\". members.calbar.ca.gov.
