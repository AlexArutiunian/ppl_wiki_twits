She was an op-ed and book review editor at The Wall Street Journal (2013\u20132017)[1] and an op-ed staff editor and writer on culture and politics at The New York Times (2017\u20132020).[2] Since March 1, 2021, she has worked as a regular columnist for German daily newspaper Die Welt.[3] Weiss founded the media company The Free Press (formerly Common Sense) and hosts the podcast Honestly.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nWeiss was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Lou and Amy Weiss, former owners of Weisshouse, a Pittsburgh company founded in 1943 that sells flooring, furniture, and kitchens; they own flooring company Weisslines.[4] She grew up in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood and graduated from Pittsburgh's Community Day School and Shady Side Academy. The eldest daughter among four sisters, she attended the Tree of Life Synagogue and had her bat mitzvah ceremony there.[5][6] After high school, Weiss went to Israel on a Nativ gap year program, helping build a medical clinic for Bedouins in the Negev desert and studying at a feminist yeshiva and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.[6][7]\nWeiss attended Columbia University in New York City, graduating in 2007.[8][9] She founded the Columbia Coalition for Sudan in response to the War in Darfur.[10] Weiss was the founding editor from 2005 to 2007 of The Current, a magazine at Columbia for politics, culture, and Jewish affairs.[11][12] Following graduation, Weiss was a Wall Street Journal Bartley Fellow in 2007 and a Dorot Fellow from 2007 to 2008 in Jerusalem.[5][13]\n\nColumbians for Academic Freedom\nMain article: Columbia Unbecoming controversy\nAs a student at Columbia, Weiss took an active role in the Columbia Unbecoming controversy. Following the release of the film Columbia Unbecoming in fall 2004, alleging classroom intimidation of pro-Israel students by pro-Palestinian professors, she co-founded Columbians for Academic Freedom (CAF) together with Aharon Horwitz, Daniella Kahane, and Ariel Beery. Weiss said she had felt intimidated by Professor Joseph Massad in his lectures,[14] and she thought he spent too much time talking about Zionism and Israel for a course about the entire Middle East.[15]\nIn response to the release of the film, Columbia put together a committee to examine the allegations.[16] The committee criticized Massad, but emphasized a lack of civility on campus, including from pro-Israel students who heckled some of their professors.[17][18] Weiss criticized the committee for its focus on individual grievances, maintaining that students were intimidated because of their views.[19]\nIn her 2019 book, How to Fight Anti-Semitism, Weiss describes the contentious atmosphere during this period as giving her \"a front row seat to leftist anti-Semitism\" at the university.[20]:\u200a94\u200a The activism initiated by Weiss was alleged by Glenn Greenwald to be \"designed to ruin the careers of Arab professors by equating their criticisms of Israel with racism, anti-Semitism, and bullying, and its central demand was that those professors (some of whom lacked tenure) be disciplined for their transgressions\".[21]\n\nCareer\nIn 2007, Weiss worked for Haaretz and The Forward.[6] In Haaretz, she criticized the tenure promotion of Barnard College anthropologist Nadia Abu El-Haj[22] over a book that Weiss alleged caricatured Israeli archaeologists.[23] From 2011 to 2013, Weiss was senior news and politics editor at Tablet.[6][24]\n\n2013\u20132017: The Wall Street Journal\nWeiss was an op-ed and book review editor at The Wall Street Journal from 2013 until April 2017.[1] She left following the departure of Pulitzer Prize winner and deputy editor Bret Stephens, for whom she had worked, and joined him at The New York Times.[25]\n\n2017\u20132020: The New York Times\nIn 2017, as part of an effort by The New York Times to broaden the ideological range of its opinion staff after the inauguration of President Trump, opinion editor James Bennet hired Weiss as an op-ed staff editor and writer about culture and politics.[26][27][28] Through her first year at the paper, she wrote opinion pieces advocating for the blending of cultural influences, something derided by what she termed the \"strident left\" as cultural appropriation.[29] She criticized the organizers of the 2017 Women's March protesting the inauguration of President Trump for their \"chilling ideas and associations,\" particularly singling out several individuals she believed to have made antisemitic or anti-Zionist statements in the past.[30] Her article about the Chicago Dyke March, asserting that intersectionality is a \"caste system, in which people are judged according to how much their particular caste has suffered throughout history,\"[31] was condemned by playwright Eve Ensler, creator of the Vagina Monologues, for misunderstanding the work of intersectional politics.[32] Other sources condemned the article as fundamentally misunderstanding the definition of intersectionality.[33][34][35]\nIn January 2018, Babe.net published an anonymous woman's allegation that comedian and actor Aziz Ansari's behavior during a date rose to the level of sexual assault. Weiss published a piece titled \"Aziz Ansari Is Guilty. Of Not Being a Mind Reader\", one of many responses to this incident in the context of the #MeToo movement.[36][37][38] Weiss was one of several writers, including Caitlin Flanagan of  The Atlantic, who argued that the woman who wrote the piece ignored her own agency, not considering her own ability to speak up and leave the situation.[39] (Flanagan's essay was one of several that year for which she was a finalist for the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary.[40])\nIn March 2018, Weiss published the column \"We're All Fascists Now\" in which she argued that members of the left wing are increasingly intolerant of alternate views, presenting varied examples. Shortly after publication, the piece was corrected and an editorial note was placed on it because one of the examples used was a fake antifa Twitter account. This account had been identified as fake in multiple media outlets in 2017 as a right-wing masquerade aimed at discrediting the left-wing protest movement.[41][42][43]\nIn May 2018, Weiss published \"Meet the Renegades of the Intellectual Dark Web\". This piece profiled a collection of thinkers who share an unorthodox approach to their fields and to the media landscape. Weiss collectively described them as the Intellectual Dark Web, borrowing the term from Eric Weinstein, managing director of Thiel Capital. Outlets have commented on and critiqued the label through 2020.[44][45][46]\nOn June 7, 2020, the Times editorial page editor, James Bennet, resigned after more than 1,000 staffers signed a letter protesting his publication of an op-ed[26] by U.S. Senator Tom Cotton saying that since \"rioters have plunged many American cities into anarchy,\" soldiers should be sent as backup for the police to end the violence. Bennet later stated he had not read the op-ed beforehand.[47] Weiss characterized the internal controversy as an ongoing \"civil war\" between what she called young \"social justice warriors\" and what she identified as older \"free speech advocate\" staffers.[47][48][49] This characterization was disputed by some other journalists and opinion writers at the Times; Taylor Lorenz, a technology reporter who covers internet culture, described it as a \"willful misrepresentation\" that ignored the numerous older staffers who had spoken out, while Jamal Jordan, the Times' digital storytelling editor, criticized her for not listening to her black colleagues and instead dismissing their concerns as a \"woke civil war\".[47]\n\n2020: Resignation from The New York Times\nWeiss announced her departure from The New York Times on July 14, 2020, publishing a resignation letter on her website criticizing the Times for capitulating to criticism on Twitter and for not defending her against alleged bullying by her colleagues.[50] Weiss accused her former employer of \"unlawful discrimination, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge\".[2]\nHer resignation from the Times drew considerable news coverage after accusing the Times of \"caving to the whims of critics on Twitter\".[2] In her letter Weiss said, \"Stories are chosen and told in a way to satisfy the narrowest of audiences, rather than to allow a curious public to read about the world and then draw their own conclusions.\" She also wrote, \"Twitter is not on the masthead of The New York Times, but Twitter has become its ultimate editor.\"[51]\nHer letter was praised by U.S. Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Kelly Loeffler; Donald Trump Jr.; political commentator Ben Shapiro;[52][53] former Democratic presidential candidates Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson; and political commentator Bill Maher.[54][55][56] Conversely, Weiss's resignation letter attracted substantial criticism from left-leaning media sources.[57] Alex Shephard criticized the content of Weiss's letter in The New Republic, calling Weiss's resignation a form of \"self-cancellation\" and part of a pattern in Weiss's work of \"taking thin, anecdotal evidence and framing it in grandiose, culture-war terms\".[58] Writing in The Guardian, Moira Donegan called Weiss a \"professional rightwing attention seeker\" and disputed her claim that social media's influence had led to a hostile media environment for conservatives.[59]\nThe Financial Times has described Weiss as a \"self-styled free speech martyr\".[60] In 2021, Weiss compared her own professional travails to Galileo Galilei, an Italian scientist who was threatened with being burnt at the stake if he did not renounce his scientific views.[60]\nOn October 27, 2020, Weiss appeared on the American talk show The View to discuss cancel culture, which she called \"wrong and deeply un-American\"; she continued, \"I believe that no one should be hung or have their reputation destroyed or lose their job because of a mistake or liking a bad tweet.\"[61][62]\nBeginning in 2020, Weiss occasionally wrote articles for the German newspaper Die Welt. Since March 1, 2021, she works as Contributing editor for Die Welt.[3]\n\n2021\u2013present: Substack / The Free Press and media\nIn January 2021, Weiss launched a Substack newsletter entitled \"Common Sense\".[63] The name was later changed to \"The Free Press\", which became a media company of the same name.[64] In February, she interviewed Gina Carano about her firing from The Mandalorian.[65][66] On November 8, 2021, Pano Kanelos, formerly the president of St. John's College, announced the creation of the University of Austin in Weiss's newsletter.[67][68][69]\n\nPolitical views\nAccording to The Washington Post, Weiss \"portrays herself as a liberal uncomfortable with the excesses of left-wing culture\",[70] and has sought to \"position herself as a reasonable liberal concerned that far-left critiques stifled free speech\".[71] Vanity Fair described Weiss as \"a provocateur\".[6] The Jewish Telegraphic Agency said that her writing \"doesn't lend itself easily to labels\".[72] Weiss has been described as conservative by Haaretz, The Times of Israel, The Daily Dot, and Business Insider.[73][74][75][76] In an interview with Joe Rogan, she described herself as a \"left-leaning centrist\".[77]\nWeiss has expressed support for Israel and Zionism in her columns. When writer Andrew Sullivan described her as an \"unhinged Zionist\", she responded saying she \"happily plead[s] guilty as charged\".[78] In 2018, she said she believed the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, but questioned whether they should disqualify him from serving on the Supreme Court because he was 17 when he allegedly committed the assault against Christine Blasey Ford.[75] After backlash in the press, Weiss conceded that her sound bite was glib and simplistic, and said instead that Kavanaugh's \"rage-filled behavior\" before the Senate Judiciary Committee should have disqualified him.[6]\n\nFollowing the Tree of Life synagogue massacre in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, Weiss was a guest on Real Time with Bill Maher in early November 2018. She said of American Jews who support President Donald Trump: I hope this week that American Jews have woken up to the price of that bargain: They have traded policies that they like for the values that have sustained the Jewish people\u2014and frankly, this country\u2014forever: Welcoming the stranger; dignity for all human beings; equality under the law; respect for dissent; love of truth.[79] In 2019, The Jerusalem Post named Weiss the seventh most influential Jew in the world.[80]\nIn January 2022, Weiss was criticized by a doctor appearing on CNN for her comments on the late night talk show Real Time with Bill Maher criticizing COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, citing that the COVID-19 pandemic response had resulted in mental health issues and that as a result she was \"done with COVID\".[81]\n\nPersonal life\nWeiss prefers not to label her sexual orientation but has stated that although she had been married to a man, she is mostly attracted to women. While attending Columbia University, she had an on-and-off relationship with comedian Kate McKinnon.[6][82] She also dated Ariel Beery, with whom she had co-founded Columbians for Academic Freedom.[10] From 2013 to 2016, Weiss was married to environmental engineer Jason Kass.[6] Since 2018, Weiss has been in a relationship with Nellie Bowles,[83][84] a former tech reporter for The New York Times. The couple have since married, and have a daughter, born in 2022.[85]\n\nAwards\n2018: Reason Foundation\u2019s Bastiat Prize, which honors writing that \"best demonstrates the importance of freedom with originality, wit and eloquence\".[24]\n2019: National Jewish Book Award in Contemporary Jewish Life and Practice for How to Fight Anti-Semitism[86][87]\n2021: LA Press Club's Daniel Pearl Award for Courage and Integrity in Journalism, \"for her persistent\u00a0willingness to resist groupthink,\u00a0her commitment to telling the truth, even when it\u2019s politically inconvenient,\u00a0and her courage in standing up for her people against the rising tide\u00a0of antisemitism and Zionophobia\u201d (Judea Pearl in the name of the Daniel Pearl Foundation).[88]\nWorks\nHow to Fight Anti-Semitism (2019)[89]\nThe New Seven Dirty Words (2020)\nReferences\n\n\n^ a b \"By Bari Weiss\".

Shapiro writes columns for Creators Syndicate, Newsweek, and Ami Magazine, and serves as editor emeritus for The Daily Wire, which he co-founded in 2015. Shapiro is the host of The Ben Shapiro Show, a daily political podcast and live radio show. He was editor-at-large of Breitbart News from 2012 until his resignation in 2016. Shapiro has authored sixteen books.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nShapiro was born on January 15, 1984,[1] in Los Angeles, California, to a Conservative Jewish family. He is Ashkenazi Jewish.[2][3][4][5] When he was 9 years old, his family began to observe Orthodox Judaism.[5] He started playing violin at a young age[6] and performed at the Israel Bonds Banquet in 1996 at 12 years of age.[7] His parents both worked in Hollywood. His mother was a TV company executive, and his father, David Shapiro, worked as a composer.[4]\nSkipping two grades (third and ninth), Shapiro went from Walter Reed Middle School in The Valley to Yeshiva University High School of Los Angeles in Westside, Los Angeles, where he graduated in 2000 at age 16.[8][9] He then attended the University of California, Los Angeles, graduating in 2004 at age 20 with a B.A. degree, summa cum laude, in political science and membership in Phi Beta Kappa. Afterwards, he attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2007 with a J.D., cum laude.[10]\n\nCareer\nLaw\nAfter graduating law school, he then worked at the law offices of Goodwin Procter, but left after 10 months.[11] As of March 2012[update], he ran an independent legal consultancy firm, Benjamin Shapiro Legal Consulting, in Los Angeles.[9]\n\nAuthor\nShapiro became interested in politics at a young age. He started a nationally syndicated column when he was 17, becoming the youngest nationally syndicated columnist in the United States,[9] and had written two books by age 21.[12][13]\nIn his first book Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America's Youth (2004), Shapiro argues that the American Left has ideological dominance over universities and that professors do not tolerate non-left opinions.[14][15]\nIn 2011, HarperCollins published Shapiro's fourth book, Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV, in which Shapiro argues that Hollywood has a left-wing agenda that it actively promotes through prime-time entertainment programming. In the book, the producers of Happy Days and M*A*S*H say they pursued a pro-pacifist, anti-Vietnam-War agenda in those series.[16] Shapiro also became a fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.[17]\nIn 2013, Threshold Editions published Shapiro's fifth book, Bullies: How the Left's Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans.[18]\nIn 2017, he released his first and to date only fiction novel, True Allegiance.[19]\nIn 2019, Shapiro published the book The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great, which focuses on the importance of Judeo-Christian values and laments the decline of those values in modern America.\nIn 2021, Shapiro published the book The Authoritarian Moment, which argues that there is not a pressing authoritarian threat in U.S. politics from the right-wing. Rather, he argues that the authoritarian threat comes from the left's control of academia, Hollywood, journalism, and corporate America.[20]\n\nBreitbart News\nIn 2012, Shapiro became editor-at-large of Breitbart News, a website founded by Andrew Breitbart.[21] After Breitbart came under the leadership of Steve Bannon, Shapiro attempted to distance himself from him.[22][23]\nOn February 7, 2013, Shapiro published an article citing unspecified Senate sources who said that a group named \"Friends of Hamas\" was among foreign contributors to the political campaign of Chuck Hagel, a former U.S. Senator awaiting confirmation as Secretary of Defense as a nominee of President Barack Obama, but weeks later Slate reporter David Weigel reported there was no evidence such a group existed.[24] Shapiro told Weigel that the story he published was \"the entirety of the information [he] had.\"[25][26][27] Shapiro later expressed regret over publishing the story.[28]\nIn March 2016, Shapiro resigned from his position as editor-at-large of Breitbart News following what he characterized as the website's lack of support for reporter Michelle Fields in response to her alleged assault by Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump's former campaign manager,[29][30] in spite of video and eyewitness evidence of the assault.[31][32] In his resignation statement, Shapiro stated, \"Steve Bannon is a bully, and has sold out [the late Breitbart.com founder Andrew Breitbart's] mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump; he has shaped the company into Trump's personal Pravda\".[33] After Shapiro's departure, Breitbart published a piece, falsely attributed to Shapiro's father's pseudonym, saying, \"Ben Shapiro betrays loyal Breitbart readers in pursuit of Fox News contributorship,\" which Breitbart later deleted.[34][35] Despite being critical of Bannon, Shapiro defended Bannon when he was accused of antisemitism.[36]\n\nOther media activities\nOn October 7, 2013, Shapiro and business partner Jeremy Boreing co-founded TruthRevolt,[37] a U.S. media watchdog and activism website, in association with the David Horowitz Freedom Center. TruthRevolt ceased operations in March 2018.[38]\nOn January 14, 2021, Shapiro was featured as a guest writer for Politico's Playbook newsletter, where he defended House Republicans who opposed the second impeachment of Donald Trump.[39] The newsletter drew immense backlash from many Politico staffers, some of whom argued that Shapiro should not have been allowed to write the article. Matthew Kaminski, editor-in-chief of Politico, refused to apologize and defended the decision to allow Shapiro to write the article, stating that, \"We're not going to back away from having published something because some people think it was a mistake to do so.\"[40][41] According to the Daily Beast, more than 100 Politico staffers signed on to a letter to publisher Robert Allbritton criticizing both Politico's decision to feature Shapiro's article and the response from Kaminski.[42]\nShapiro cameoed in The Daily Wire film, Lady Ballers, that was released December 1, 2023. He portrayed the character of a referee.[43][44]\n\nHost\nSee also: The Ben Shapiro Show\nShapiro in 2018\nIn 2012, Shapiro joined KRLA-AM 870 as a host on their morning radio program alongside Heidi Harris and Brian Whitman.[45] By 2016, he was one of the hosts for KRLA's The Morning Answer, a conservative radio show. Internal emails showed that Shapiro faced pressure from Salem Media executives, the syndicate that owned the show, to be more supportive of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. Shapiro, however, remained highly critical of Trump throughout the election.[46]\nShapiro and Boreing founded The Daily Wire on September 21, 2015. He serves as editor emeritus as well as the host of his online political podcast The Ben Shapiro Show, broadcast every weekday.[47][48] As of March\u00a02019[update], the podcast was ranked by Podtrac as the second most popular podcast in the U.S.[49] Westwood One began syndicating The Ben Shapiro Show podcast to radio in April 2018.[50] In 2018, Politico described the podcast as \"massively popular\".[51] In January 2019, Westwood One expanded Shapiro's one-hour podcast-to-radio program, adding a nationally syndicated two-hour live radio show, for three hours of Ben Shapiro programming daily.[52] As of March 2019, according to Westwood One, The Ben Shapiro Show is being carried by more than 200 stations, including in nine of the top ten markets.[53] In June 2020, Shapiro stepped down from his role as editor-in-chief, which he had held since the site's founding, and took on the role of editor emeritus.[54]\nIn September 2018, Shapiro started hosting The Ben Shapiro Election Special on Fox News. The limited-run series covered news and issues relating to the 2018 midterm elections.[55]\nShapiro has made frequent appearances on PragerU with talks on intersectionality and Hollywood with 4,900,000 to 8,400,000 views as of December\u00a02018[update].[56][48][57]\nIn 2021, Ben Shapiro's podcast was ranked as the 9th most listened on Apple podcasts.[58]\n\nSpeaker\nShapiro speaking at CPAC 2018\nShapiro speaks at college campuses across the United States. In his speeches, he often presents a conservative viewpoint on controversial subjects. He spoke at 37 campuses between early 2016 and late 2017.[4]\nSome students and faculty members at California State University, Los Angeles objected to a speech that Shapiro, who was then an editor at Breitbart News, was scheduled to hold at the university on February 25, 2016, titled \"When Diversity Becomes a Problem\". University president William Covino canceled the speech three days before it was to take place, with the intention of rescheduling it so that the event could feature various viewpoints on the subject of campus diversity. Covino ultimately reversed his decision, allowing the speech to go on as planned.[59][60] The day of the speech, student protesters formed human chains, blocking the doors to the event and staging sit-in protests. When Shapiro began his speech, a protester pulled the fire alarm. After the speech ended, Shapiro was escorted out by campus police.[61] Conservative youth organization Young America's Foundation (YAF) announced it was filing a lawsuit against the university (with Shapiro as one of the plaintiffs), claiming that the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the students were violated by Covino's attempted cancellation of the event as well as by the physical barricading of students from entering or leaving the event.[62][63]\nIn August 2016, DePaul University revoked an invitation for Shapiro to address students at the school and barred him from entering the campus owing to \"security concerns\".[64]\nOn September 14, 2017, Shapiro gave a speech at the invitation of the University of California, Berkeley student organization Berkeley College Republicans (BCR) in which he criticized identity politics.[65][66] The event was supported by the YAF and BCR.[63] It involved a large police presence, which had been promised by Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ in her August letter that supported free speech. Together, the university and the city of Berkeley spent $600,000 on police and security for the event, which transpired with nine arrests but no major incidents.[67][68][69]\n\nViews\nShapiro speaking at Politicon in Pasadena, California in 2016\nIn 2012 he was hailed as a \"rising star in America's conservative movement\" in Zman Magazine.[9] In 2016, Shapiro described himself as \"basically a libertarian\".[70] In 2021, he described himself as \"generally libertarian\" in regards to the role of the government and as a conservative in regards to the role of social structures.[71] The New Yorker, Haaretz and Vox have described Shapiro as \"right-wing\".[72][73][74] Shapiro's views have been described by The New York Times as \"extremely conservative\"[4] and was described by The Economist as a \"radical conservative\" and as a \"classically religious-conservative\".[75] A 2020 study News, Nationalism, and Hegemony: The Formation of Consistent Issue Framing Throughout the U.S. Political Right examining issue framing by right-wing podcasts used The Ben Shapiro Show as an example which \"offered a mainstream conservative perspective that favors President Donald Trump and his framing on issues like 'nationalism'\" in a two-by-two matrix that also examined a Stormfront podcast, an alt-right podcast, and the Daily Standard podcast; the study argued that Shapiro's rhetoric was similar to that used in the Stormfront podcast, though with a different tone.[76] In 2023, Forbes and The Gainesville Sun classified him as far-right.[77][78] Boston University described The Daily Wire as far-right.[79]\nShapiro has described the political left as believing in an imaginary \"hierarchy of victimhood\" in which the opinions of members of persecuted groups like the LGBT community are afforded more credence. He has argued that the left has dominated American culture through popular entertainment, media, and academia in a way that has made conservatives feel disenfranchised and helped lead to the election of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.[4] He has stated that \"political correctness breeds insanity\".[80] Shapiro is an outspoken opponent of safe spaces, especially those on college campuses, arguing that they go against free speech.[81][82] Shapiro frequently praises Western culture and Western civilization,[76] saying \"I believe Western civilization is superior to other civilizations.\"[76]\n\nAbortion\nShapiro speaking at the 2018 Young Women's Leadership Summit in Dallas, Texas\nShapiro supports a ban on abortion,[83] including in cases of rape and incest, with one exception: when competent medical authority determines that the life of the mother is in jeopardy as a result of the pregnancy. He has further clarified that this includes extreme cases of mental illness where the life of the mother is at risk due to suicide. He also believes that doctors who perform abortions should be prosecuted.[84] He has referred to women who have abortions as \"baby killers.\"[85][86][87] In 2019, Shapiro asserted that \"the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade\" was \"not going to happen\", and added that he had \"serious doubts\" about \"whether the Supreme Court, as currently constituted, would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade\".[88]\nIn 2019, Shapiro spoke at the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., where he said abortion is a \"violent act\".[89]\n\nAlt-right\nShapiro is a critic of the alt-right movement,[90][75] stating in 2017, \"It is a garbage movement composed of garbage ideas. It has nothing to do with constitutional conservatism.\"[80] In 2019, Shapiro criticized weekly newspaper The Economist for describing him as \"alt-right\" in their interview with him; in response, The Economist issued an apology and modified the article title to instead describe Shapiro as a \"radical conservative\".[91]\nShapiro has been a target of online harassment and antisemitic threats from the alt-right. After leaving Breitbart News, Shapiro was a frequent target of antisemitic rhetoric from the alt-right.[35] According to a 2016 analysis by the Anti-Defamation League, Shapiro was the most frequent target of antisemitic tweets against journalists.[92][93]\n\nCapital punishment\nShapiro is an advocate of capital punishment and \"strongly\" supports it remaining legal in the United States.[94] Explaining his beliefs, Shapiro has stated that, \"You can forfeit the right to life if you take another life, just as you can forfeit your right to liberty (this is called prison) by infringing on the liberty of another\".[95]\n\nClimate change\nShapiro has acknowledged climate change as a legitimate phenomenon, although he has questioned \"what percentage of global warming is attributable to human activity.\"[96] In relation to concerns over increased flooding of coastal property from sea-level rise as a result of climate change, Shapiro stated, \"You think people aren't just going to sell their homes and move?\".[97] In an opinion piece on the 2020 California wildfires, Shapiro argued that state policies had contributed more to the severity of the fires than climate change. In response, Scientific American accused Shapiro of promoting climate change denial.[98] In 2021, he stated that a global temperature increase of 4\u00a0\u00b0C (7.2\u00a0\u00b0F) did not amount to an emergency, and that describing it as one of was \"purely a political designation\".[99]\n\nFacebook\nIn 2018, Shapiro argued that Facebook was targeting conservative sites after the platform implemented an algorithm change, limiting their traffic, and that they are not transparent enough.[100] In 2021, an article in NPR revealed that, under Shapiro's leadership, the Daily Wire had dominated Facebook news feeds and received more engagement than any other news outlet \"by a wide margin\".[101]\n\nGun ownership\nFollowing the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Shapiro appeared on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight on January 10, 2013. On the issue of gun control, Shapiro called Piers Morgan a \"bully\" who \"tends to demonize people who differ from you politically by standing on the graves of the children of Sandy Hook, saying they don't seem to care enough about the dead kids.\"[102][103] Videos of the encounter quickly received millions of views and went viral.[48]\nWriting in October 2017, in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, Shapiro argued that \"banning all guns would be unwise as well as immoral,\" additionally Shapiro stated, \"...here\u2019s the problem: Not a single gun law short of full-scale gun confiscation would have prevented Las Vegas or any of the other mass shootings we\u2019ve seen. Furthermore, there is no correlation between states with high rates of gun ownership and states with high rates of gun homicide.\"[104]\n\nHealth\nIn 2021, Shapiro said that he was in favor of the COVID-19 vaccine and that he was vaccinated,[105][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] but is against COVID-19 vaccine mandates.[106]\n\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\nAccording to Shapiro, the reason behind the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict was that \"Israel exists, and Hamas wishes it didn't exist\".[107] In 2003, Shapiro published a column on Townhall demanding that Israel \"transfer the Palestinians and the Israeli-Arabs from Judea, Samaria, Gaza and Israel proper.\" Citing expulsion of Germans after World War II as a precedent,[108] Shapiro insisted that \"expelling a hostile population is a commonly-used and generally effective way of preventing violent entanglements.\" In the same article, Shapiro said that \"The ideology of the Palestinian population is indistinguishable from that of the terrorist leadership.\"[109] Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg criticised Shapiro's comments as an example of his \"fascist\" views.[110][111] Shapiro later reversed his view on the West Bank issue, saying it was \"both inhumane and impractical\".[112]\nIn 2010, Shapiro said \"Israelis like to build. Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage\". He later stated that he was talking about the Israeli and Arab leadership, as well as terrorist groups in Palestine.[113][72][114]\nIn a 2008 Townhall opinion piece, Shapiro expressed support for Israel's settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank.[115]\nIn 2019, Shapiro said that Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar, whose comments about American support for Israel were accused of evoking antisemitic tropes, and the white supremacist San Diego shooter, hold \"a lot of the same opinions about Jews.\"[116]\nIn May 2021, during the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis, Ben Shapiro stated that Hamas' rocket attacks \"would entail an anti-Semitic genocide\", adding that Hamas was spending \"tens of millions of dollars in foreign aid\" on building \"terror tunnels and rocket capacity to strike at the Jews.\" Shapiro argued that Hamas was positioning its rockets in civilian areas, seeking to \"force Israel to kill Palestinian civilians so Hamas can propagandize about supposed Israeli human rights atrocities.\" He stated that Hamas was killing not only Jews, but also Israeli Arabs and foreign workers. He also criticized the media coverage of the crisis, labeling it as \"absurd\",[107] and specifically criticized The New York Times for its opinion article featuring a Palestinian writer titled \"The Myth of Coexistence in Israel\". Shapiro stated that an image used in the article, a map of Israel, was \"so bad that MSNBC, which used the image in 2015, had to retract it and admit it was factually incorrect.\"[117]\n\nMilitary policy\nIn a 2002 article, Shapiro wrote, \"I am getting really sick of people who whine about 'civilian casualties'... when I see in the newspapers that civilians in Afghanistan or the West Bank were killed by American or Israeli troops, I don't really care\". Shapiro declared that \"One American soldier is worth far more than an Afghan civilian\", accusing Afghan civilians of being \"fundamentalist Muslims\" who provide cover for terrorists or give them money.[118][non-primary source needed] Shapiro later apologized for these comments, stating that the 2002 article was \"just a bad piece, plain and simple, and something I wish I'd never written\". He said that while he still partially agreed with his article's main point\u2014\"that we must calculate the risk to American services members when we design rules of engagement\"\u2014he \"expressed [that point] in the worst possible way, and simplified the issue beyond the bounds of morality (particularly by doubting the civilian status of some civilians)\".[114][non-primary source needed]\nShapiro supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, arguing that \"China is a dictatorship. North Korea is a dictatorship. Saudi Arabia, Libya, Syria, Pakistan and Egypt are all dictatorships. We can't overthrow all of those regimes simply to free their citizens. We have to focus on those regimes that endanger American security.\"[119]\n\nLGBT issues\nIn 2010, Shapiro argued that homosexuality should not have been removed as a mental illness from the DSM because homosexuals have higher rates of depression than heterosexuals and do not reproduce.[120][121] In 2014, Shapiro argued that the United States \"is not a country that discriminates against homosexuals\" and that \"there is a vastly minute amount of discrimination against gays in this country.\"[122]\nShapiro opposed the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court ruling that deemed bans of same-sex marriage unconstitutional.[123] However, he opposes government involvement in marriage, saying, \"I think the government stinks at this,\" and expressing concern that because of the ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, at some point the government may try to force religious institutions to perform same-sex weddings against their will.[70][124] According to Slate's Seth Stevenson, Shapiro has described homosexuality as a sin.[84] He has said that \"a man and a woman do a better job of raising a child than two men or two women\".[85]\nHe has stated he does not feel same-sex marriage should be taught to students in schools, saying, \"In California, they've already passed laws that you have to teach same-sex marriage in public schools, for example... I went to public school for elementary school and junior high, I don't know why the government is teaching me anything about this stuff. This is for my parents to teach me. This is a values thing.\" He also states, \"I'm very much anti gay-marriage in the social sense. As a religious person, I think homosexuality is a sin, I think that lots of things are sins that people engage in, I think they should be free to engage in them.\"[70] Shapiro also opposes same-sex couples raising children.[75]\nShapiro believes transgender people suffer from mental illness.[80][125] He has commented, \"You can't magically change your gender. You can't magically change your sex,\" and has compared such changes to the notion of changing one's age or identifying as an animal.[4]\nIn July 2015, Shapiro and transgender rights activist Zoey Tur were on Dr. Drew On Call to discuss Caitlyn Jenner's receipt of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award.[126][127] After Shapiro referred to Tur, who is a trans woman, as \"sir\" and questioned her genetics, she placed her hand on the back of his neck and threatened on air to send him \"home in an ambulance\". Shapiro replied, \"That seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion.\" Later, Shapiro filed a police report accusing Tur of battery and stated that he intended to press charges to \"teach the left a lesson\". Tur said the report was Shapiro's attempt to keep the story in the news.[128][129][73][130]\nIn 2019, in response to 2020 Democratic Party presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke calling for the removal of the tax-exempt status of religious institutions opposed to same-sex marriage, Shapiro said that if O'Rourke was going to try to \"indoctrinate\" his children in religious schools, Shapiro would be forced to either \"leave the country\" or \"pick up a gun.\"[131]\n\nPornography\nShapiro has condemned the availability of pornography;[132] however, in support of a more limited government, he has expressed disapproval of using government intervention to regulate it.[133]\n\nDonald Trump\nIn the spring of 2016, Shapiro wrote an article for the Daily Wire in which he stated he would \"never vote for Donald Trump\".[134] Shapiro supported Ted Cruz in the 2016 presidential election and opposed Trump's candidacy.[135] In August 2016, Shapiro wrote an article for the Daily Wire arguing that Trump, if elected, would not appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court.[136] He described Steve Bannon as a \"bully\" who \"sold out Breitbart founder Andrew Breitbart's mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump.\"[137] Shapiro has stated that Trump's victory in the 2016 election was more of a vote against Hillary Clinton than a vote in favor of Trump.[4]\nShapiro supported the Trump administration's ordering of the killing of Qasem Soleimani,[138] recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,[139] as well as the nominations of Brett Kavanaugh[140] and Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.[141] Shapiro also supported Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, cutting regulations, and his nomination of 12 appellate court judges.[141] However, Shapiro criticized Trump for firing James Comey, for appointing Michael Flynn and Steve Bannon, and for endorsing Roy Moore.[141]\nOn October 19, 2020, Shapiro announced that he would be voting for Trump in the 2020 presidential election: \"There are three reasons I'm going to vote for Donald Trump in 2020 when I didn't four years ago: First, I was simply wrong about Donald Trump on policy. Second, I wasn't really wrong about Donald Trump on character, but whatever damage he was going to do has already been done, and it's not going to help if I don't vote for him this time. And third, and most importantly: The Democrats have lost their fucking minds.\"[142] He rebuked Trump on election night, November 3, 2020, when Trump prematurely claimed himself the winner when neither he nor his opponent Joe Biden had yet reached the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency. He tweeted: \"No, Trump has not already won the election, and it is deeply irresponsible for him to say he has.\"[143] Shapiro denounced the false claim that Trump was the legitimate winner of the 2020 election.[101] He criticized the January 6 Capitol attack whilst also criticizing the Democratic Party's response to it.[101]\n\nRace\nShapiro has stated that, while African-Americans were historically victims of injustice in the United States, he does not believe in the existence of widespread systemic injustice today.[4] In 2017, Shapiro stated that \"the idea that black people in the United States are disproportionately poor because America is racist; that's just not true.\"[144] Shapiro has dismissed the idea that the United States was founded on slavery and argued that America was founded in spite of slavery.[145][146]\nShapiro was one of several conservative commentators condemning Representative Steve King (R-IA) after King's January 2019 comments in defense of the terms \"white supremacy\" and \"white nationalism\". Shapiro called for King to be censured, and supported King's 2020 primary challenger Randy Feenstra.[147]\n\nBlack Lives Matter\nShapiro has criticized Black Lives Matter and has stated that \"the Black Lives Matter movement did indeed begin with protests about police brutality but quickly morphed into broader debates over the validity of looting and rioting, tearing down historic statues, slavery reparations and defunding the police.\"[148][non-primary source needed]\nAfter the trial of Derek Chauvin, where police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of the murder of George Floyd, Shapiro stated that Chauvin should not have been found guilty of murder, and instead erroneously suggested that Floyd died of a drug overdose rather than as a result of Chauvin's actions.[149][150]\n\nJudaism\nShapiro practices Orthodox Judaism,[151] which he states informs his ideological positions. Shapiro wears a yarmulke, the traditional Jewish skullcap. In a 2011 tweet, Shapiro claimed that Judaism is plagued by \"Bad Jews\" who \"largely vote Democrat\".[152] The same year, he wrote an article titled \"Jews in Name Only\" in which he claimed \"Jews who vote for Obama are, by and large, Jews In Name Only (JINOs)\" and that such Jews \"do not care about Israel\" or that they \"care about it less than abortion, gay marriage and global warming\".[153] During the 2016 presidential election, he wrote an article titled \"No, It Doesn't Matter That Bernie Sanders Is Ethnically Jewish. He's a Jew In Name Only.\"[154]\nIn October 2022, Shapiro condemned Kanye West's antisemitic comments, comparing them to propaganda in Nazi Germany. He also called West \"unstable.\"[155]\n\nMuslims\nBen Shapiro has argued that immigrants from Islamic countries degrade the United States.[76]\nIn a 2014, YouTube video entitled \"The Myth of the Tiny Radical Muslim Minority\", Shapiro said, \"We're above 800 million Muslims who are radicalized \u2013 more than half the Muslims on earth. That's not a minority... the myth of the tiny radical Muslim minority is just that: it's a myth\". PolitiFact and Channel 4 News in the UK rejected his methodology, arguing that support for Sharia law was not sufficient to label an individual a \"radical Muslim\", and that \"The meaning of Sharia law varies from sect to sect and nation to nation.\" Channel 4 News also criticized his use of polls with small sample sizes as accurately representing the views of tens of millions of Muslims, though acknowledged that \"some polls do show that very illiberal values and concepts can be prevalent in some Muslim countries\".[156][157]\nIn the 2016 Quebec City mosque shooting, 6 Muslims were killed by Alexandre Bissonnette. Police presented evidence that Bissonnette checked Shapiro's Twitter feed 93 times in the month leading up to the shooting.[158] Shapiro condemned the attack and said he didn't incite the shooting.[159][160]\n\nUnited States politics\nIn 2006, Shapiro called for sedition laws to be reinstated. He cited speeches critical of the George W. Bush administration by Democrats Al Gore, John Kerry and Howard Dean as \"disloyal\" and seditious.[161][162] Shapiro subsequently retracted these views in a 2018 column, stating that his 2006 column \"absolutely blows. It's garbage\" and adding that the idea of sedition laws was \"inherently idiotic\".[114] Shapiro later described President Barack Obama's 2010 State of the Union Address as \"philosophically fascist.\"[163]\nShapiro has called for lowering taxes on the very wealthy.[4] He has also backed privatizing Social Security and repealing the Affordable Care Act.[4] In August 2022, Shapiro argued that \"Marxism can't work in America,\" saying this was because of \"high levels of societal income mobility\".[164]\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2008, Shapiro married Mor Toledano, an Israeli medical doctor of Moroccan descent,[165][166] and they lived in Los Angeles.[4] The couple has two daughters and two sons.[167][168] They practice Orthodox Judaism.[169] \nIn 2019, the FBI arrested a man from Washington for making death threats against Shapiro and his family.[170][171]\nIn September 2020, Shapiro announced that he and his family were moving out of California.[172] While he relocated the headquarters of his Daily Wire enterprise to Nashville, Tennessee, he and his family resettled in South Florida.[173][174]\nShapiro's sister, Abigail Shapiro, who studied operatic singing, is a conservative media influencer who posts videos on her YouTube channel \"Classically Abby\".[175] She has been subjected to online antisemitic trolling due to her brother's high public profile.[176] Ben Shapiro is a cousin of writer and actress Mara Wilson,[177][178] though the two are not on speaking terms due to their conflicting political views.[179]\n\nBibliography\nBrainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America's Youth.

He began his career as a speechwriter for U.S. presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford before entering the entertainment field as an actor, comedian, and game show host. He is best known on screen as the economics teacher in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, as the host of Win Ben Stein's Money, and as Dr. Arthur Neuman in The Mask and Son of the Mask. Stein also co-wrote and starred in the controversial 2008 film Expelled which was widely criticized for promoting pseudoscientific intelligent design creationist claims of persecution.[1][2] Stein is the son of economist and writer Herbert Stein, who worked at the White House under President Nixon. As a character actor he is well known for his droning, monotonous delivery. In comedy, he is known for his deadpan delivery.[3]\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nStein was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Mildred (n\u00e9e Fishman), a homemaker, and Herbert Stein, a writer, economist, and presidential adviser.[4] He is Jewish and grew up in the Woodside Forest neighborhood of Silver Spring, Maryland. Stein graduated from Montgomery Blair High School in 1962 along with classmate journalist Carl Bernstein (class of 1960); actress Goldie Hawn (class of 1963) was one year behind.[5] He went on to major in economics at Columbia University's Columbia College, where he was a member of Alpha Delta Phi and the Philolexian Society. After graduating with honors from Columbia in 1966, Stein went to Yale Law School, graduating as valedictorian in June 1970.\n\nCareer[edit]\nLegal and academic career[edit]\nStein speaking at Miami University in 2003\nHe was first a poverty lawyer in New Haven, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C. before becoming a trial lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission.\nStein's first teaching stint was as an adjunct professor, teaching about the political and social content of mass culture at American University in Washington, D.C. He subsequently taught classes at the University of California, Santa Cruz on political and civil rights under the United States Constitution. At Pepperdine University Stein taught libel law and United States securities law and its ethical aspects. He was a professor of law and economics at Pepperdine University Law School from about 1990 to 1997.[6]\n\nWriting career[edit]\nStein writes a regular column in the conservative media outlets The American Spectator and Newsmax. He has also written for numerous publications, including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, New York Magazine, Penthouse, Los Angeles Magazine, and Barron's Magazine.[citation needed] He wrote a regular biweekly column for Yahoo! Finance online, with his last article dated August 7, 2009.[7] His bestselling books (with investment advisor Phil DeMuth) include Yes, You Can Retire Comfortably; Can America Survive?; and Yes, You Can Time the Market. In 2009, he published a collection of essays, The Real Stars.\nStein was fired from his position as a Sunday Business columnist at The New York Times in August 2009 owing to a policy prohibiting writers from making product endorsements or advertising. Stein had recently become an advertising spokesman for credit information company Freescore.com and, according to a Times statement, had assumed there would be no conflict provided that he did not discuss credit scoring in general or FreeScore.com itself in his column. However, the publication felt that it would be inappropriate for him to write for them while he was involved in advertising and terminated his contract.[8] Writing in The Spectator, Stein states his belief that the real reasons for his firing were budget cuts at the Times, his criticism of Obama, and pressure from those critical of Expelled, who \"bamboozled some of the high pooh-bahs at the Times into thinking there was a conflict of interest\".[9]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nStein with United States Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England in 2008\nStein began his political career as a speechwriter and lawyer for President Richard Nixon, and later for President Gerald Ford. On May 3, 1976, Time magazine speculated on the possibility of Stein having actually been Deep Throat. Stein responded over the years not only by denying he was Deep Throat but by going further and accusing journalist Bob Woodward of falsifying the famous secret source. In the May 14\u201321, 1998, edition of the Philadelphia City Paper, Stein is quoted as saying, \"Oh, I don't think there was a Deep Throat. That was a fake. I think there were several different sources and some they just made up.\"[10] After Mark Felt's identity as Deep Throat was revealed, Stein stated that Nixon would have prevented the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge if he had not been forced to resign. For his actions leading to that resignation, Stein said:\n\nIf there is such a thing as karma, if there is such a thing as justice in this life or the next, Mark Felt has bought himself the worst future of any man on this earth. And Bob Woodward is right behind him, with Ben Bradlee bringing up the rear. Out of their smug arrogance and contempt, they hatched the worst nightmare imaginable: genocide.[11]\nIn 2005, Stein said in the American Spectator:Can anyone even remember now what Nixon did that was so terrible? He ended the war in Vietnam, brought home the POWs, ended the war in the Mideast, opened relations with China, started the first nuclear weapons reduction treaty, saved Eretz Israel's life, started the Environmental Protection Agency. Does anyone remember what he did that was bad?\nOh, now I remember. He lied. He was a politician who lied. How remarkable. He lied to protect his subordinates who were covering up a ridiculous burglary that no one to this date has any clue about its purpose. He lied so he could stay in office and keep his agenda of peace going. That was his crime. He was a peacemaker and he wanted to make a world where there was a generation of peace. And he succeeded.\n\nThat is his legacy. He was a peacemaker. He was a lying, conniving, covering up peacemaker. He was not a lying, conniving drug addict like JFK, a lying, conniving war starter like LBJ, a lying, conniving seducer like Clinton\u2014a lying, conniving peacemaker.[11]\nCareer in the media[edit]\nStein speaks at a gala in honor of the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors in 2008\nStein acted as the monotonous economics teacher in the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In one scene, he lectures on the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 and the then-current debate over supply-side economics.\nStein played similarly bland and unemotional characters. He had a recurring role in the TV series The Wonder Years (as science teacher Mr. Cantwell, who would narrate 16\u00a0mm films in monotone) and played himself in Dave.\nHe appeared in several television advertisements, such as for Clear Eyes eye drops throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Godfather's Pizza in 1987, a bland science teacher in 1990 for Sprinkled Chips Ahoy! cookies, and in 2013 for small business accounting service firm 1-800Accountant.\nFrom 1997 to 2003, Stein hosted the Comedy Central game show Win Ben Stein's Money along with co-host Jimmy Kimmel (replaced by Nancy Pimental and later by Sal Iacono). True to its name, the money that contestants won on the show was subtracted from the $5,000 pay that Stein earned per episode (in addition to his salary). The show won five Daytime Emmy Awards before ending its run in 2003.\nIn 1999, Stein also hosted the Comedy Central talk show Turn Ben Stein On. One of the mainstays of the show was Stein's dog, Puppy Wuppy, who had free run of the set. In 2001, Stein appeared on a celebrity episode of The Weakest Link entitled \"TV Hosts Edition\" alongside other television hosts and was voted off in round 6 despite being that round's Strongest Link. Anne Robinson's quip was that while he \"might win Ben's money; you're NOT taking ours!\".\nOther movies and television shows in which Stein has appeared include Charles in Charge; Seinfeld; Full House; Casper; Casper: A Spirited Beginning; Casper Meets Wendy; The Mask and its sequel, Son of the Mask as well as the television show, The Mask: Animated Series; Earthworm Jim; Star Search; MacGyver; Tales from the Crypt; Richie Rich; Game Show Moments Gone Bananas; Cavuto on Business; The O'Reilly Factor; CBS News Sunday Morning; Planes, Trains and Automobiles; Family Guy; the 1998\u20132004 version of Hollywood Squares; the Michael Berger-hosted version of Match Game; The Fairly OddParents; Duckman; Married... with Children; The Emperor's New School; My Girl 2; Ghostbusters II; and the intelligent design documentary Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed.[12]\n\nStein (right) with Carl and Rachel Lender of Lender's Bagels in 2019\nIn addition, Stein's voice roles include The Pixies, magical creatures on the animated series The Fairly OddParents; Mr. Purutu on the animated series The Emperor's New School; Professor Wisenstein in Bruno the Kid; the birthday party clown, Mr. Giggles, on The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius; a bingo caller on Rugrats; and Pip on Animaniacs. Futterman in Freakazoid. Stein also voiced a psychiatrist, again named after himself, in the USA TV series Duckman; he once appeared in the sitcom Married... with Children as a receptionist in the animal afterlife. He also made a cameo appearance in the comic book Young Justice, as Ali Ben Styn. Another cameo appearance was as Rabbi Goldberg in the Family Guy episodes \"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\" and \"Family Goy\". Stein also voiced the character Sam Schmaltz in the 1996 computer adventure game Toonstruck.\nStein has written for the television industry, including outlines for the TV movie Murder in Mississippi and for the lengthy ABC miniseries Amerika. He has also contributed to the creation of the talk show parody series Fernwood 2 Night.\nStein hosted a show on VH1 called America's Most Smartest Model. The show aimed to find the smartest among 14 models through a series of challenges.[13]\nOn May 14, 2006, during an appearance on the Fox News program Your World with Neil Cavuto, Stein called for a tax increase of 3.5% for wealthy Americans, to be earmarked for soldiers and military initiatives. Stein wrote an editorial for The New York Times critical of those who would rather make money in the world of finance than fight terrorism.[14]\nOn December 28, 2009, Stein appeared on CNN's Larry King Live with Ron Paul to discuss the attempted bombing of an American plane on Christmas Day 2009. Stein said that Paul's stance that the United States were \"occupiers\" in Iraq and Afghanistan was antisemitic. The comment started a shouting match between the two men.[15] Two days later, Stein clarified that \"if Rep. Paul says he is... not an anti-Semite, I believe him\".[16]\nStein's political and economics commentary has appeared on CNBC's The Kudlow Report and CNN.[17]\n\nCommentary in the lead-up to and during the Great Recession[edit]\nIn the months before the late-2000s recession, Stein made frequent and vehement claims about the economy's good health and the relative unimportance of the mortgage-derivative market; these would shortly be proven dead wrong.\nExamples include:\n\nOn March 18, 2007, as the subprime mortgage crisis began, Stein wrote a column for the online version of CBS News Sunday Morning. He proclaimed that the foreclosure problem would \"blow over and the people who buy now, in due time, will be glad they did,\" that the economy was \"still very strong,\" and that the \"smart money\" was \"now trying to buy\u2014not sell\u2014as much distressed merchandise\" in mortgages as possible.[18]\nIn an August 12, 2007, column in The New York Times, titled \"Chicken Little's Brethren, on the Trading Floor\", Stein\u2014while acknowledged that \"I don't know where the bottom is on subprime. I don't know how bad the problems are at Bear [Bear Stearns]\"\u2014claimed that \"subprime losses are wildly out of all proportion to the likely damage to the economy from the subprime problems,\" and \"[t]his economy is extremely strong. Profits are superb. The world economy is exploding with growth. To be sure, terrible problems lurk in the future: a slow-motion dollar crisis, huge Medicare deficits and energy shortages. But for now, the sell-off seems extreme, not to say nutty. Some smart, brave people will make a fortune buying in these days, and then we'll all wonder what the scare was about.\"[19]\nOn August 18, 2007, on Fox News Channel's Cavuto on Business, Stein and other financial experts dismissed worries about a coming credit crunch.[20] Thirteen months later, in the global financial crisis in September 2008, global stock markets crashed, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken over by the US government, AIG was bailed out by the Federal Reserve, Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America Corporation, and Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs confirmed that they would become traditional bank holding companies.\nIn January 2008, business commentator Henry Blodget wrote a piece for Business Insider entitled, \"Ben Stein is an Idiot\", which stated that Stein's criticism of those with bearish views and positions on the market was either \"delusional\" or a deliberate and \"shrewd\" attempt to create false controversy and drive up web traffic.[21]\nIn a Yahoo! Finance article published on October 17, 2008, Stein said his wildly incorrect claims were due to his expectations that the real-estate market would roughly resemble the collapse of junk bonds in the early 1990s. He said he failed to understand that debt obligations based on real estate loans were less than the \"staggeringly large\" amount of obligations that were created through trading in derivatives of those: \"Where I missed the boat was not realizing how large were the CDS [credit default swaps] based on the junk mortgage bonds.\"[22]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nStein is married to entertainment lawyer Alexandra Denman.[23][24] They were married in 1968 and divorced in 1974. They reconciled and in 1977 they were married again.[citation needed] Stein lives[when?] with Denman in Beverly Hills and Malibu, California.[25][26] He also has a summer home in Sandpoint, Idaho,[27] and an apartment in the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., which he inherited from his parents.[28] In 2014, performance artist Tanya Ma claimed that a financial arrangement between her and Stein had turned inappropriate.  Stein said of the incident that he only expected \"hugging and kissing\" and that he often gets \"mad crushes\" on women that \"last about ten minutes.\"[29]\n\nViews and advocacy[edit]\nAbortion[edit]\nStein is a supporter of the criminalization of abortion and was given an anti-abortion award in 2003 by the National Right to Life Educational Trust Fund.[30]\n\nLarry Craig scandal[edit]\nIn 2007, Stein chastised the police and the GOP leadership for their response to the Larry Craig scandal. Stein said that Craig's sexuality should not be an issue: \"A party that believes in individual rights should be rallying to his defense, not making him walk the plank.\"[31]\n\nTax code[edit]\nStein has criticized the United States Internal Revenue Code for being too lenient on the wealthy. He has repeated the observation made by Warren Buffett, one of the richest individuals in the world (who pays mostly capital gains tax), that Buffett pays a lower overall tax rate than his secretaries (who pay income taxes and payroll taxes). Stein has advocated increasing taxation on the wealthy.[32] Stein objected to Obama's proposal in 2010 not to extend tax cuts for the highest earning taxpayers in the midst of the recession, saying that\n\nThere is no known economic theory under which raising my taxes in the midst of a severe recession will help the economy recover. It isn't part of any well known monetarist or Keynesian theory. So if it does no good to raise our taxes, I assume we are being punished. But for what? I don't own slaves. I employ a lot of people full- and part-time and they are all happy with their pay. When charity calls, I almost always write out a check...Maybe when the economy recovers, raising my taxes makes sense, but for now, it's just punishment.[33]\nIn 2012, Stein stated that due to the tremendous amount of national debt, he agreed with Obama's proposal to increase taxes on the wealthy and that ultimately everyone's taxes should be raised to avoid defaulting on the debt.[34]\n\nDominique Strauss-Kahn[edit]\nWhen the head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was arrested for sexual assault and attempted rape in 2011, Stein published an editorial[35] in The American Spectator in which he closely scrutinized Strauss-Kahn's accuser and cited Strauss-Kahn's education, wealth, and position as reasons to believe he was unlikely to have committed the crime.\n\nIn life, events tend to follow patterns. People who commit crimes tend to be criminals, for example. Can anyone tell me any economists who have been convicted of violent sex crimes?[36]\nStein's editorial was criticized by a number of media outlets.[37][38][39][40] Jon Stewart dedicated an entire segment on The Daily Show to his response.[41] All charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn were formally dismissed by a judge on 23 August 2011.\n\nFerguson shooting[edit]\nIn response to the death of Michael Brown, Stein made the following comment:\n\nThe idea of calling this poor young man unarmed when he was 6'4\", 300 pounds, full of muscles, apparently, according to what I read in The New York Times, on marijuana. To call him unarmed is like calling Sonny Liston unarmed or Cassius Clay unarmed. He wasn't unarmed. He was armed with his incredibly strong, scary self.[42]\nEvolution[edit]\nSee also: Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed\nStein has denounced the scientific theory of evolution, which he and other intelligent design advocates call \"Darwinism\", declaring it to be \"a painful, bloody chapter in the history of ideologies\", \"the most compelling argument yet for Imperialism\", and the inspiration for the Holocaust.[43][44] Stein does not say belief in evolution alone leads to genocide, but that scientific materialism is a necessary component.[45] He co-wrote and stars in Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, a film that aims to persuade viewers that evolution was instrumental to the rise of the eugenics movement, Nazi Germany, and the Holocaust, and portrays advocates of intelligent design as victims of intellectual discrimination by the scientific community, which has rejected intelligent design as creationist pseudoscience.[1][46][2] In the trailer for the film, Stein said that his aim was to expose \"people out there who want to keep science in a little box where it can't possibly touch God.\"[47]\nMany critics point out that Stein selectively used and edited quotes by Charles Darwin to make his case in Expelled, also noting that scenes shot at Pepperdine University, in which Stein gives a speech to an auditorium full of students, in fact used a large number of extras, hired to respond favorably to Stein's speech, to fill the room.[48]\nThe media response to the film has been largely unfavorable. It received an 11% meta-score from Rotten Tomatoes. Multiple reviews, including those of USA Today and Scientific American, have described the film as propaganda.[1][46][2]\nIn a Trinity Broadcasting Network interview with Paul Crouch Jr. regarding the movie, Stein claimed that \"[religion] leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people\".[49]\nThe Anti-Defamation League issued a statement condemning the film's misuse of the Holocaust and its imagery, \"Using the Holocaust in order to tarnish those who promote the theory of evolution is outrageous and trivializes the complex factors that led to the mass extermination of European Jewry\".[50]\nAt the University of Vermont, Stein was invited to receive an honorary degree and be the commencement speaker for the graduating class of 2009. University President Dan Fogel received complaints about Stein's planned appearance, due to Stein's views on evolution. Stein declined his commencement invitation.[51]\nAt the private, Christian Liberty University 2009 graduation, Stein was awarded an honorary degree and, according to the university, \"spoke extensively about his work on Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed\".[52]\n\nForeign policy[edit]\nStein is a staunch supporter of Israel. On Larry King Live in 2009, in a heated exchange with then-Congressman Ron Paul, he referred to Paul as antisemitic for referring to the U.S. as \"occupiers\" in the Arabian peninsula.[53]\n\nPolitical endorsements[edit]\nStein endorsed John McCain for president in 2008, calling him \"an impressive guy\".[54] That year, he also stated that he would vote for Ralph Nader.[55] In January 2012, Stein appeared in political advertisements sponsored by Associated Industries of Florida supporting legislation that would create three resort casinos in South Florida.[56] He claimed in late 2014 that President Barack Obama was the most racist president in American history, saying Obama \"made everything about race\".[57]\nIn 2016, Stein reprised the famous attendance scene from Ferris Bueller in a campaign ad[58] for Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley. In it, Stein intoned the last name of Grassley's opponent (Patty Judge) to silence, while facts about her missed votes and absences from state board meetings were listed. Stein then calls out \"Grassley,\" which gets a response; Stein mutters, \"He's always here.\"[59]\nStein initially supported Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but retracted his support in October 2016, writing, \"But it's time for Donald Trump to go back to Trump Tower. Time for Mike Pence to move to the top of the ticket.\"[60] However, Stein went on to vote for Trump.[61]\n\nAunt Jemima[edit]\nIn February 2023, Stein released a video on Donald Trump's Truth Social stating he missed the Aunt Jemima logo with a \"large African American woman chef.\" He added, \"But, I prefer when it was a black person, showing their incredible skill at making pancakes.\"  The video was also shared on Twitter[62] and the story ran on media outlets across the country.[63][64]\nThe original Aunt Jemima logo and brand name was retired in 2021 by PepsiCo and its subsidiary, Quaker Oats. This was due to the connection with the \"Mammy\" stereotype and racial connotations associated with the character.[65][66]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nStein's book titles to date (7 fiction, 21 nonfiction) include:\n\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nPublisher\nISBN\n\n\n1978\n\n\nOn the Brink: A Novel (coauthor: Herbert Stein)\n\nBallantine Books\n\n0-345-27650-7\n\n\n1978\n\nDreemz (hardcover: California Dreemz)\n\nBallantine Books\n\n0-345-28156-X\n\n\n1979\n\nThe View from Sunset Boulevard: America as Brought to You By the People Who Make Television\n\nBasic Books\n\n0-465-09032-X\n\n\n1981\n\nMoneypower: How to Make Inflation Make You Rich (coauthor: Herbert Stein)\n\nAvon\n\n0-380-54809-7\n\n\n1982\n\n'Ludes\n\nSt. Martin's Press\n\n0-312-50012-2\n\n\n1986\n\nHer Only Sin\n\nSt. Martin's Press\n\n0-312-90636-6\n\n\n1988\n\nHollywood Days, Hollywood Nights: The Diary of a Mad Screenwriter\n\nBantam Books\n\n0-553-34520-6\n\n\n1992\n\nA License to Steal: the Untold Story of Michael Milken and the Conspiracy to Bilk the Nation\n\nSimon & Schuster\n\n0-671-74272-8\n\n\n2002\n\nHow to Ruin Your Life\n\nHay House\n\n1-56170-974-3\n\n\n2003\n\nHow to Ruin Your Love Life\n\nHay House\n\n1-4019-0240-5\n\n\n2004\n\nHow to Ruin Your Financial Life\n\nHay House\n\n1-4019-0241-3\n\n\nCan America Survive?

    "wiki": "American journalist\nFor the American businessman, see Bernard Goldberg (businessman).\nBernard GoldbergGoldberg in 2011.BornBernard Richard Goldberg (1945-05-31) May 31, 1945 (age\u00a078)New York City, New York U.S.Occupation(s)Journalist and authorYears\u00a0active1972\u2212presentWebsitebernardgoldberg.com\nBernard Richard Goldberg (born May 31, 1945) is an American author, journalist, and political pundit. Goldberg has won fourteen Emmy Awards and was a producer, reporter and correspondent for CBS News for twenty-eight years (1972\u20132000)[1] and a paid contributor for Fox News for ten years (2009\u20132018).[2] He is best-known for his on-going critiques of journalism practices in the United States\u2014as described in his first book published in 2001, Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News. He was a correspondent for Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel on HBO for 22 years until January 2021.[3][4]\n\n\nPersonal background[edit]\nGoldberg was born in New York City in 1945[5] and graduated from Rutgers University in 1967.[6] Goldberg is of Jewish descent.[7]\n\nPersonal politics[edit]\nThough frequently described as a conservative, Goldberg previously rejected the label, describing himself as a life-long liberal modeled after the 1960s ideals of the U.S. Democratic Party. In a February 22, 2012, interview, Goldberg said: \"The reason (people claim I'm conservative) is so I'll be automatically marginalized. I wrote in 'Bias' that I would make racial discrimination a criminal offense, not just a civil offense.\nOn gay rights, I don\u2019t know anyone more Libertarian than me. I don\u2019t want the government getting involved in it. I\u2019m pro-abortion with reservations. I\u2019ve never set foot in a country club in my life. I consider myself to be an old-fashioned liberal. I\u2019m a liberal the way liberals used to be when they were like John F. Kennedy and when they were like Hubert Humphrey, when they were upbeat and enthusiastic and mainstream. I am not a liberal the way liberals are today, at least as exemplified by Al Franken and Michael Moore, where they\u2019re angry, nasty, closed minded, and not mainstream, but fringe. I think this is what really irks the media (about me). That this is coming from one of them. I was one of them for 28 years.\"[8]\nGoldberg has since accepted the label of \"conservative,\" saying in 2020, \"I see myself as a conservative with live and let live principles\u2026 a conservative libertarian I guess. Now, even when I agree with liberals on this issue or that, I no longer want to be on their team. I not only don\u2019t accept their new left wing politics, it\u2019s also their holier than thou elitism that annoys me. I no longer see myself as a liberal. They left me, not the other way around. Now, I\u2019m a conservative. Not a right-wing nut, just a conservative with libertarian tendencies.\"[9]\n\nCareer[edit]\nFrom 1972 to 1974 he worked for CBS News as a producer in Atlanta; he became a reporter in 1974 and correspondent in 1976.[10] Goldberg frequently contributed to the CBS Evening News and CBS newsmagazines Eye to Eye with Connie Chung and 48 Hours. For CBS, he hosted two primetime documentaries, Don't Blame Me and In Your Face, America.[11] Don't Blame Me was broadcast on May 26, 1994, and explored alleged irresponsibility of Americans.[12] In Your Face, America, which aired on April 7, 1998, said that American culture suffers from a \"coarsening\" instigated by entertainment such as The Jerry Springer Show, South Park, and gangsta rap music.[13]\nIn 2001, his first book, Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News, was published[14] and became a number one New York Times bestseller.[15][16]\nGoldberg followed Bias with two books\u2014Arrogance: Rescuing America from the Media Elite in 2003 and 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America in 2005. Boston Globe journalist Cathy Young\u2014praised by Goldberg in 100 People\u2014criticized the book for listing mostly liberal or liberal-leaning individuals and only \"a Few Token Right-Wingers\". There were also many favorable comments about the book including one from Jonah Goldberg (no relation) who said, \"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America is a rollicking and revealing look at 100 of the most egregious obstacles on the path of our nation's return to glory\" and Brent Bozell, who commented: \"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America is out, and it's a wonderful read for anyone not on that list.\"[17]\nCrazies to the Left of Me, Wimps to the Right: How One Side Lost Its Mind and the Other Lost Its Nerve followed in 2007, then came A Slobbering Love Affair: The True (And Pathetic) Story of the Torrid Romance Between Barack Obama and the Mainstream Media in 2009. Both books were also national bestsellers with A Slobbering Love Affair hitting number two on the New York Times list.\n\nAwards[edit]\nGoldberg has been awarded an Emmy for journalism 14 times (six at CBS News, eight[18] at HBO). For his June 2000 segment \"Dominican Free For All\", in which he investigated corrupt Major League Baseball recruiting practices in the Dominican Republic, Goldberg won a Sports Emmy for \"Outstanding Sports Journalism\". He won that award again in 2005 for his story exposing Saudi Arabia's illegal use of young boys as camel jockeys, in 2008 for a story about post-concussion syndrome suffered by some former NFL players, and in 2009 for a story on Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel about the slaughter of racehorses that were no longer making money for their owners.[19][20]\nIn May, 2011 Goldberg won another sports Emmy, this one for his story on the connection between head trauma suffered by athletes and a disease similar to ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.[21] In April 2012, Goldberg won his 12th Emmy, this one for a report on the College Bowl Money Trail.[22] And in May 2017, he won his 13th Emmy for an investigation of the International Olympic Committee.[23] Later that year, in October 2017, Goldberg won another Emmy, a News Emmy[18] in the Investigative Reporting category, for his story on head injuries in youth football. Goldberg received the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award in 2006 for a story on the exploitation of children in the United Arab Emirates. It marked the first time that a sports program had won a duPont award.[24]\nIn 2012, Goldberg won his second duPont for a body of work on concussions in the NFL, the duPont committee saying that, \"Correspondent Bernard Goldberg's interviews are sensitive and probing, moving the story forward. Goldberg and his team investigate the historical precedent of Lou Gehrig bringing to light new information about concussions he suffered as a baseball player at Columbia University and as a Yankee. The reporting raised awareness for the public, the NFL and Congress about this important health issue.[25]\nIn 2018, Bernie and a team of Real Sports journalists won another duPont-Columbia Award for a story about the Olympics entitled \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d As the duPont committee described it:  \"This ambitions investigative report\u2014filmed in nine countries\u2014exposed graft and corruption in the IOC and detailed how its members pursue wealth, privilege, and self-glory at the expense of the Games.[26]\nIn 2020, Goldberg and the Real Sports team won the 2019 Investigative Reporters & Editors sports award for their piece \"Game Change.\" The report focused on the changing demographics of tackle football.[27]\n\nBooks[edit]\nBias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News (2001)\nArrogance: Rescuing America from the Media Elite (2003)\n100 People Who Are Screwing Up America (2005)\nCrazies to the Left of Me, Wimps to the Right: How One Side Lost Its Mind, and the Other Lost Its Nerve (2007)\nA Slobbering Love Affair: The True (And Pathetic) Story of the Torrid Romance Between Barack Obama and the Mainstream Media (2009)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Goldberg on CBS: Nothing Good to Report\".

He served as a federal prosecutor and as a U.S. Representative.[2] He represented Georgia's 7th congressional district as a Republican from 1995 to 2003.[2][3] Barr attained national prominence as one of the leaders of the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.[2] During his time in the House of Representatives, he authored the Defense of Marriage Act, which was later overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013 and repealed by the 117th Congress.[4]\nBarr joined the Libertarian Party in 2006[5] and served on its National Committee.[6] He was the Libertarian Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 election.[7] Barr announced his return to the Republican party in December 2011. He lost a subsequent bid in 2014 for a Congressional seat.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBarr was born in Iowa City, Iowa,[2] to Robert Laurence Barr and Beatrice Barr.[8] His father, a career military officer who had graduated from West Point,[8][9] was stationed in various locations around the world while pursuing his career in civil engineering.[8][10]\nThe second of six children, Bob Jr. lived as a boy in Malaysia, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Baghdad,[11] and finally Tehran, Iran, where he graduated from Community High School in 1966.[2][8][10]\nHe returned to the United States for college, attending the University of Southern California. There he joined the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity in 1967. He was elected to the position of Grand Prytanis on the fraternity's Grand Council, serving from 2013 to 2015.[12][13]\nDuring college, Barr's mother introduced him to the work of writer Ayn Rand.[8][10]  This fostered a newfound appreciation for conservatism and prompted Barr to join the Young Trojan Republican Club.[8][10] He completed his B.A., cum laude,[14] from the University of Southern California (USC) in 1970.[2] He married his first wife while still in college.[8] They divorced in 1976.[15]\n\nEarly career[edit]\nBarr continued in graduate school, earning a master's degree in International Affairs[16] from George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs in 1972. He next earned his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center (attending at night)[11] in 1977.[2][16] From 1971 to 1978,[2] Barr worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as an analyst of Latin American issues.[3][11][16]\nBarr married his second wife, Gail, in 1976.[15][17] They have two children.[15][18] Gail and Bob Barr divorced in 1986.[15][17]\nAfter leaving the CIA, Barr moved to northern Georgia. He practiced law and became active in the Republican Party, serving as county chair.[11][15] Barr made an unsuccessful bid for the Georgia House of Representatives in 1984.[15]\nIn 1986 Barr married his third wife, Jerilyn Dobbins,[15][17] who was later known as Jeri Barr.[19] Barr's website stated in 2008 that he and Jeri have four children and six grandchildren.[19]\nIn 1986, Barr was appointed by President Ronald Reagan[3] to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia \u2013 a post Barr held until 1990.[2] His office prosecuted state and local officials, members of the Medellin drug cartel, and got a perjury indictment on then-sitting Republican Congressman Pat Swindall,[20] who ultimately served a year in prison on the charges. From 1990 to 1991, Barr was president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation.[21], an Atlanta-based law firm and policy center that litigates in support of \"limited government, individual economic freedom, and the free enterprise system\".[22]\n\nCongressional career[edit]\nFurther information: Electoral history of Bob Barr\nBarr during the 107th Congress (2001\u20132003)\nBarr listening during a House Judiciary Committee hearing about the investigation of President Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky in 1998\nBarr greeting President George W. Bush in 2002\nBarr sought the Republican Party nomination for U.S. Senate in 1992, but lost the primary election to Paul Coverdell.[23] The primary was very close, with Barr losing by fewer than 1,600 votes in a runoff election.[23]  Subsequently, Coverdell came in behind incumbent Senator Wyche Fowler in the general election, but the 3% showing by a Libertarian candidate (Jim Hudson) forced a runoff, which Coverdell won.[citation needed]\nBarr was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 as a Republican, upsetting six-term Democrat Buddy Darden, to represent Georgia's 7th congressional district in the 104th United States Congress. Barr was one of 73 Republican freshmen ushered into Congress in that election.[24] The election became known as the \"Republican Revolution\" because it resulted in the first Republican House majority in 40 years \u2013 since the 1955 adjournment of the 83rd Congress.[25][26]\nAfter a Federal Election Commission audit of his 1994 and 1996 campaigns, Barr paid a $28,000 fine for illegal campaign payments.[27]\nBarr was later re-elected three times, serving from 1995 to 2003.[2] While in Congress, Barr served as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, as vice-chairman of the Government Reform Committee,[3] and as a member of the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Veteran's Affairs.[3][16]\nIn Congress, Barr became famous for his \"dour\" image and told constituents, \"You don't send me to Washington to smile.\"[11] He also said in a radio interview, \"If it's not in the Constitution, I won't smile.\"[28] He later explained \"I don't consider politicians who smile to be worth a heck of a lot... all things considered, it doesn't make a dime's worth of difference if the politicians in Washington smile or not, what matters is how much of your hard-earned dollars they take to spend in pure pork.\"[29] Barr said in 2010, \"I can see a situation where the federal government is going to bring an entire suitcase of San Francisco values to the American family, and while I would love to explain all the things that are wrong with that, the fact is that this is a corrupting, left-leaning, influence on a section of society that so many liberal elites want to see taken out of the 'red state' column. The only solution to this kind of behavior is dour and austere social conservatism, like my own.\"[28] Adding to his image, Barr has frequently protested about \"cult hairstyles\", saying \"I cannot abide by people who adopt a cult hairstyle, or persistently dress inappropriately for meetings with me.\"[30][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nGeorgia's congressional districts were reorganized by the Democratic-controlled Georgia legislature ahead of the 2002 elections for the 108th Congress.[31]  As part of the legislature's effort to get more Democrats elected from the state, Barr's district was renumbered as the 11th District and made significantly more Democratic.  A large slice of his base was drawn into the same district as fellow Republican John Linder. The new district was numerically Barr's district \u2013 the 7th \u2013 but contained most of the territory from Linder's old 11th District. This move profited Democrats by leading to the inevitable defeat of an incumbent Republican (i.e., either Barr or Linder).[32] Recognizing Barr's precarious situation, the Libertarian Party seized on the opportunity to oust one of the federal drug war's most vocal proponents (Barr), and ran TV ads criticizing Barr's opposition to medical marijuana during the Republican primaries.[33] Barr was soundly defeated by a 2-to-1 margin. Before the medical marijuana ads were aired,[33] the Linder campaign acknowledged the race as being tight;[34] and Pat Gartland, southeastern director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called it \"too close to call\".[32]\nBarr's defeat was applauded by many Democrats and Libertarians. Rob Kampia of the Marijuana Policy Project called it \"glorious news\".[35] Ron Crickenberger, the Libertarian Party's political director and producer of the TV ads, was quick to warn other supporters of the War on Drugs:[33]\n\nWith this victory, we have fired a warning shot for every drug warrior in Congress to hear. And any member of Congress \u2013 Democrat or Republican \u2013 who introduces legislation to make federal drug laws even more oppressive could be next on our list.\nHowever, some individuals within these groups lamented Barr's defeat as a setback for privacy rights[36] and libertarian causes in general.[34]  J. Bradley Jansen, vice chair of the Libertarian Party in the District of Columbia, opined:[34]\n\nThe LP has a historic opportunity to present itself as a viable alternative to the big parties, instead of spending its money and energy trying to defeat one of libertarianism's few friends in Congress just because they disagree with him on one issue.\nPolitical positions in Congress[edit]\nDuring his tenure, Barr was regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress.[37] In 2002, he was described by Bill Shipp in an OnlineAthens.com article as \"the idol of the gun-toting, abortion-fighting, IRS-hating hard right wing of American politics\".[32] However, Barr's criticism of the Bush administration's policies on privacy and other civil liberties after the 9/11 attacks was unusual among House Republicans (see Criticism of Bush Administration below).[32] This criticism earned Barr other labels such as \"Maverick\",[32] \"Jekyll-and-Hyde\",[38] and \"Libertarian\".[34]\n\nGun ownership[edit]\nBarr is a staunch proponent of gun rights, and is opposed to any and all efforts to restrict the ownership of guns.[39][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nDuring the 2002 race, a supporter handed Barr an antique pistol during a fundraiser at a private home. The gun went off in Barr's hands, though no one was injured.[40]\n\nWar on drugs[edit]\nBarr was originally a strong supporter of the War on Drugs, reflecting his previous experience as an Anti-Drug Coordinator for the United States Department of Justice.[2] While in Congress, he was a member of the Speaker's Task Force for a Drug-Free America.[38] This task force was established in 1998 by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich to \"design a World War II-style victory plan to save America's children from illegal drugs.\"[41] The task force crafted legislation specifically designed to \"win the War on Drugs by 2002\".[41]\nBarr advocated complete federal prohibition of medical marijuana. In 1998, he successfully blocked implementation of Initiative 59[42]\u00a0\u2013 the \"Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1998\"\u00a0\u2013 which would have legalized medical marijuana in Washington, D.C.[43] The \"Barr Amendment\" to the 1999 Omnibus spending bill not only blocked implementation of Initiative 59, but also prohibited the vote tally from even being released.[43][44] Nearly a year passed before a lawsuit[45] filed by the American Civil Liberties Union eventually revealed the initiative had received 69 percent of the vote.[46] In response to the judge's ruling,[47] Barr simply attached another \"Barr Amendment\" to the 2000 Omnibus spending bill that overturned Initiative 59 outright.[48] The Barr Amendment also prohibited future laws that would \"decrease the penalties for marijuana or other Schedule I drugs\" in Washington, D.C.[49] This preemptively blocked future attempts by Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) to reform marijuana laws in DC via the initiative process.[49] In March 2002, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan struck down this portion of the Barr Amendment as being an unconstitutional restriction on free speech.[49][50] Barr's response to the ruling was defiant:\n\nClearly, the court today has ignored the constitutional right and responsibility of Congress to pass laws protecting citizens from dangerous and addictive narcotics, and the right of Congress to exert legislative control over the District of Columbia as the nation's capital.\u2014 Bob Barr, March 28, 2002[51]\nThe federal government later prevailed on appeal,[52] reinstating the Barr Amendment just in time to thwart MPP's initiative 63 \u2013 \"The Medical Marijuana Initiative of 2002\" \u2013 which had already qualified for the November 2002 ballot.[53][54] In 2009, both the United States Senate and House of Representatives voted to lift the ban against a medical marijuana initiative, effectively overturning the Barr Amendment.[55]\nBarr later reversed his position on medical marijuana, joining MPP as a lobbyist five years later. In a June 4, 2008, interview with Stephen Colbert on the Colbert Report, Barr confirmed that he now supports ending marijuana prohibition, as well as the War on Drugs, for which he once vehemently fought.[56] In 2009, he was hired by the MPP to lobby to successfully overturn the amendment that he had authored.[57]\n\nSame-sex marriage[edit]\nBarr took a lead in legislative debate concerning same-sex marriage. He authored and sponsored the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law enacted in 1996 which states that only marriages that are between a man and a woman can be federally recognized, and individual states may choose not to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state.[58] At the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, he apologized for the part of DOMA which prevents the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages.[59]\nHe now supports same-sex marriage[60] and opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment, having contended that it is a violation of states' rights.[61] Before the United States Supreme Court mandated recognition of same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges, Barr supported the Respect for Marriage Act, which would have repealed the Defense of Marriage Act.[62]\n\nTerrorism[edit]\nHe voted for the first USA PATRIOT Act,[63] but only after his amendments adding \"sunset clauses\" were added to the final bill.[64] Barr played a similar role during the debate over Bill Clinton's Comprehensive Anti-terrorism Act of 1995, crafting pro-civil liberties amendments to the original text.[65] He now publicly regrets[37] his Patriot Act vote.[66]\n\nWar in Iraq[edit]\nIn 2002 Barr voted for the Iraq Resolution.[67] He has since called for withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, leaving no permanent military bases. A press release from Barr's presidential campaign stated: \"The next president should commit to a speedy and complete withdrawal from Iraq, and tell the Iraqi people that the U.S. troops will be going home.\"[68]\n\nReligious freedom[edit]\nIn Congress, he also proposed that the Pentagon ban the practice of Wicca in the military.[37][69]\n\nEconomic freedom[edit]\nBarr advocates the repeal of the 16th Amendment, which gives the U.S. Congress the power to levy an income tax without apportionment. As an alternative, he proposes a form of consumption tax, such as the FairTax.[70]\nHe also favors drastic reductions in government spending and the elimination of corporate welfare.[70]\n\nWaco hearings[edit]\nThe National Review described Barr as one of the few people able to \"ask effective questions and make clear points\" while questioning government witnesses during the 1995 House Waco siege hearings on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Federal Bureau of Investigation actions against the Branch Davidians in 1993, sponsored by subcommittees of the House Judiciary Committee and Government Reform and Oversight Committee.[71] Barr has written: \"The hearing was a farce: a virtual lovefest, during which members of the Clinton Administration responded to softball questions from their colleagues in the House with superficial answers, and Republican queries were ignored or glossed over with disdain, if not outright contempt.\"[72] Barr called for Congress to reopen investigations, but senior House Republicans refused.[73] In 2003 testimony submitted to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Barr wrote: \"[T]here remains time to turn back the constitutional clock and roll back excessive post-9/11 powers before we turn the corner into another Japanese internment or, closer to our own experiences, before we witness a legally sanctioned Ruby Ridge or Waco scenario.\"[74]\n\nControversies over Barr's personal conduct[edit]\nIn the early 1990s, Barr was photographed at a fundraising event licking whipped cream off a woman.[75] According to The Washington Post \"Two people who observed the act say it wasn't exactly a bosom lick but more like a neckline lick, at the sort of event where business and civic leaders perform dares to raise money. 'Not exactly Mr. Effusive,' says Matt Towery, the former chairman of Newt Gingrich's political organization, who observed the brief and awkward licking. 'You can hardly get the guy to smile.'\"[76]\n\nRole in Clinton impeachment[edit]\nBarr is best known for his role as one of the House managers during President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial.\nIn the spring of 1997, Republican, Bob Barr, wrote House Committee on the Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde, encouraging him to open an impeachment inquiry. Hyde responded that such an action would be premature.[77]\nIn November 1997, Barr first introduced a resolution directing the House Judiciary Committee to begin an impeachment inquiry against Clinton, with this resolution coming months before the Monica Lewinsky scandal came to light.[78][77] This resolution, introduced in November 1997 did not specify any charges or allegations.[79] Foremost among the concerns Barr cited at the time was apparent obstruction of Justice Department investigations into Clinton campaign fundraising from foreign sources, chiefly the People's Republic of China.[80] Barr argued that Clinton had been \"systematically operating outside the bounds\" of the law.[79] He accused Clinton of \"systematic abuse of office\", alleging campaign finance law violations and obstruction of congressional investigations.[77] Eighteen other Republican members of the House of Representatives joined Barr in signing on to the resolution as co-sponsors. These members were Roscoe Bartlett, Helen Chenoweth, Barbara Cubin, John Doolittle, Lindsey Graham, Duncan L. Hunter, Sam Johnson, Jack Kingston, Jack Metcalf, John Mica,  Ron Paul, Dana Rohrabacher, Pete Sessions, Chris Smith, Mark Souder, Linda Smith, Bob Stump, and Todd Tiahrt.[79]\nAfter the Lewinsky scandal broke, Barr was the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton's resignation.[81] After the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal came to light, Barr ramped up his efforts to push for Clinton's impeachment, appearing regularly on television, as well as even publishing a scholarly article in the Texas Law Review on the subject.[82]\nDuring debate on the 1998 impeachment resolution on the House floor, Barr argued that Clinton's attempt to interfere with Lewinsky's testimony in the Paula Jones case endangered the Constitution. In doing so, Barr said, Clinton violated what Barr called a \"fundamental right\" of any American citizen \u2013 \"the unshakable right each one of us has to walk into a courtroom and demand the righting of a wrong.\"[83]\nIn 1999, during Clinton's impeachment trial, Hustler publisher Larry Flynt offered money to anyone who could provide evidence about prominent Republicans who had engaged in an extramarital affair. According to the American Journalism Review,[84] investigators for Flynt said that Barr was \"guilty of king-size hypocrisy.\" Flynt subsequently paid a sum of money to Barr's second wife, Gail Barr, after she had sworn an affidavit.[11][85]  Investigators reported that Bob Barr then \"invoked a legal privilege from his 1985 divorce proceeding so he could refuse to answer questions on whether he'd cheated on his second wife with the woman who is now his third\" (Jerilyn).[86]\n\nCriticism of Bush Administration[edit]\nA man faithful to the Constitution doesn't stop criticizing presidents when the letter after their names change.\u2014\u200aBob Barr, 2007[64]\nSince leaving Congress in 2003, Barr has become a vocal opponent of the Patriot Act and has stated that he voted for it reluctantly[11] and regrets voting for it, only agreeing because the Bush administration promised not to attempt to expand the granted powers or use them for non-terrorism purposes, and the administration agreed to report to Congress on their usage.[87] Barr says that the Bush administration promptly ignored these three promises given to Congress and has used the powers granted from the Patriot Act to further erode due process of law even in matters unrelated to terrorism.[87] Barr claims that the Clinton administration did much of the same thing.[37] In 2005\u00a0\u2013 the year the Patriot Act was due for renewal\u00a0\u2013 Barr helped found an organization called Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, a bipartisan group dedicated to eliminating aspects of the Patriot Act that could potentially affect law-abiding citizens rather than terrorists, and to \"restore traditional checks and balances on government power so the country can effectively fight terror without sacrificing the rights of innocent Americans, rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution.\"[88]  Barr still serves as the group's chairman.\nBarr has been a vocal opponent of President George W. Bush's claim of authorization to wiretap transnational phone calls without individual judicial license. He has said, \"What's wrong with it is several-fold. One, it's bad policy for our government to be spying on American citizens through the National Security Agency. Secondly, it's bad to be spying on Americans without court oversight. And thirdly, it's bad to be spying on Americans apparently in violation of federal laws against doing it without court order.\"[89]\nIn 2006, he debated the architect of the Patriot Act, Viet Dinh, on terrorism and privacy issues.[90]\n\nDeparture from Republican Party[edit]\nIn the 2004 presidential election, Barr left the Republican Party and publicly endorsed[91] the Libertarian Party presidential nominee Michael Badnarik.[92]\nIn 2006, he joined the Libertarian Party as a regional representative, then serving on the Libertarian National Committee.[93]\n\nPolitical associations[edit]\nBarr sat on the board of directors of the National Rifle Association of America from 2001 to 2007.[94]\nBarr is a commentator on political and social issues and is chairman of the American Conservative Union Foundation's '21st Century Center for Privacy and Freedom'.[95]\nIn January 2006, to emphasize the bipartisan nature of the event, Barr planned on introducing Al Gore at a speech co-sponsored by the Liberty Coalition and the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy to address what they called the \"NSA Spying Scandal\", in which Gore compared warrantless wiretapping to the FBI's illegal COINTELPRO project surveilling, discrediting and disrupting Martin Luther King Jr.[96]\n\nLibertarian Party[edit]\nOn December 12, 2006, Barr became a regional representative on the Libertarian National Committee, representing the Party's Southeast Region. Barr said: \"I'm happy to announce that I am now a proud, card-carrying Libertarian who is committed to helping elect leaders who will strive for smaller government, lower taxes and abundant individual freedom.\"[6]\n\nMarijuana Policy Project[edit]\nRegarding the drug war, I've been there, done that, and know firsthand our current strategy is not working. Continuing to have the federal government run roughshod over the states, even if the citizens of a state decide they wish to legalize medicinal marijuana, for example, is wrong.\u2014\u200aBob Barr, May 22, 2008[97]\nIn Congress, Barr's strong stance against medical marijuana put him at odds with marijuana policy reformers such as the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP). Despite this historic antagonism, in March 2007, Barr reversed his stance on medical marijuana[98] and began lobbying on behalf of MPP.[99][100] This new partnership saw Barr working to repeal his very own \"Barr Amendment\"[97]\u00a0\u2013 the amendment[98] that overturned a voter-approved medical marijuana initiative in Washington, D.C.,[99] and bars consideration of similar initiatives.[101]\nBarr has been careful to state that he isn't pro-drug, but rather against government intrusion.[98]\nBarr's reversal on drug policy surprised many, particularly MPP.[100] His new-found appreciation for harm reduction was heartily welcomed:\n\nIt's very rare to find someone who's willing to change their position and then be so public about it. [Barr has] definitely increased the credibility of the Marijuana Policy Project. People have to take us seriously when we walk through the door with Bob Barr.\u2014 Rob Kampia, Executive Director, Marijuana Policy Project, May 2008[97]\nAmerican Freedom Agenda[edit]\nBarr is one of the four founders of the American Freedom Agenda, which is described as \"a coalition established to restore checks and balances and civil liberties protections under assault by the executive branch.\" The American Freedom Agenda has established a 10-point Freedom Pledge for presidential candidates to confirm their commitment to civil liberties.[102] He is also a member of the Constitution Project's bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee.[103]\n\nLiberty Guard[edit]\nBarr is chairman of the board of directors of Liberty Guard,[104] an IRS 501(c)4 organization, which states its mission is to protect and defend individual liberty.\n\nNational Popular Vote[edit]\nBarr is a supporter of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.[105]\n\nOther activities[edit]\nIn early 2008, Barr became an adjunct professor at Kennesaw State University and was scheduled to teach a course on privacy rights titled \"Privacy and Public Policy in 21st Century Business and Society.\"[106]\nBarr appeared in the mock documentary Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. In his scene, he met with \"Borat Sagdiyev\" (portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen) in the United States Capitol. Borat gave him cheese described as being made from Borat's wife's breast milk.[107]\nBarr endorsed the Free State Project on July 22, 2008, saying, \"I think it's tremendous!\"[108][109]\nBarr is listed as the President of the Law Enforcement Education Organization, a non-profit organization with a mission of serving \"active-duty and retired law enforcement officers, by educating and assisting law enforcement personnel and agencies meet challenges posed by certain laws and regulations.\"[110][111]\n\nPublications and commentary[edit]\nBarr wrote The Meaning of Is: The Squandered Impeachment and Wasted Legacy of William Jefferson Clinton (published in 2004). He briefly wrote a regular column for Creative Loafing (Atlanta), an alternative weekly newspaper serving the Atlanta metropolitan area.[37][112]\nIn 2008 Barr hosted a political talk radio show on Radio America called Bob Barr's Laws of the Universe.[113] He has said that he plans to write a book with that title.[114]\nIn August 2008, Barr published an opinion piece in The Washington Times that criticized the United States' response to the conflict between Russia and Georgia as being too emotional and not based on legitimate American national security concerns. He wrote: \"The most important American interest is defending America; and intervening on behalf of Georgia against Russia has nothing to do with defending America.\"[115] In October 2008, Barr gave a one-hour talk at Carnegie Mellon University, allowing time to take audience questions. This was one of numerous lectures for which he was paid.\nIn 2008, in an Op-Ed article published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Barr lambasted the new policy of Boston, Massachusetts police to allow warrantless search for firearms in teenagers' homes.[116] On March 7, 2009, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution announced that Barr would be a weekly columnist for the paper.[117] His blog is known as The Barr Code.[118]\n\nAdvising former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier[edit]\nIn 2011, Barr traveled to Haiti to lobby on behalf of \"former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier.\"[119] According to Barr, \"he is not serving as Duvalier's attorney, but is in Port-au-Prince to consult, assist and be Duvalier's voice to the international community.\"[119]\n\n2008 presidential campaign[edit]\nMain article: Bob Barr 2008 presidential campaign\nIn early 2008, rumors circulated that Barr was considering a presidential run under the Libertarian Party banner. Activists began a Facebook group dedicated to drafting Barr into the nomination contest,[120] and Barr later confirmed his interest.[121] He launched a presidential exploratory committee and campaign website[122] on April 5,[123] and formally announced his candidacy[124] for the Libertarian nomination on May 12.[125]  His announcement came a mere ten days before the start of the Libertarian Party Convention, where delegates select the presidential candidate.[126]\n\nBob Barr speaks in October 2008.\nFollowing his announcement, Rasmussen Reports had Barr polling at 6% nationwide against Barack Obama (42%), John McCain (38%), and Ralph Nader (4%).[127] The study identified Barr as the Libertarian candidate, but most voters said they did not know enough about him to have an opinion of him personally.[127] Barr's support in the poll was a net drain on Republicans; he picked up 7% of the Republican vote, 5% of the Democratic vote, and 5% of the unaffiliated vote.[127]\nOn May 25, 2008, Barr became the 2008 Libertarian presidential nominee after six rounds of voting at the 2008 Libertarian convention. He beat Mary Ruwart in the final round of voting, with 324 delegates to Ruwart's 276, with 26 none-of-the-above votes.[128] Barr had received the endorsement of Wayne Allyn Root, one of his rivals for the nomination, after Root was eliminated following the fifth round of balloting. Barr, in turn, endorsed Root for the party's vice presidential nomination, which he received. Reason magazine senior editor Radley Balko called Barr \"the first serious candidate the LP has run since I've been eligible to vote.\"[129]\nOn June 4, 2008, Barr invited the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, John McCain, and the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee, Barack Obama, to weekly presidential debates through an official press release.[130]\nMany opinion leaders predicted that Barr could siphon off conservative votes that would have otherwise gone to McCain. John Linder, who defeated Barr for the Republican nomination in a 2002 congressional race, said that Barr could cause serious problems for McCain in some states.[131] Barr repeatedly rejected this assertion as scapegoating, responding that small-government Republicans would not vote for McCain anyway, nor would civil liberties advocates vote for Obama.[132]\nBarr appeared on the ballot in 45 states.[133] In July, he filed a lawsuit against Oklahoma for its unusually restrictive ballot access laws,[134] which he contends are contrary to the First Amendment right to petition one's government for a redress of grievances.[135] In July, a Zogby poll had Barr receiving 6% of the vote nationwide, as well as double digits in several states.[136]\nA Zogby poll released on August 15, 2008, indicated that most Republican and Democratic voters wanted Barr to be included in the presidential debates. The poll also indicated that almost 70% of independent voters would have liked to see him included.[137]\nOn September 17, 2008, Barr filed suit in Texas to remove both McCain and Obama from the ballot. Both political parties failed to file their nominees by the deadline.[138]  On September 23, 2008, the Texas Supreme Court rejected the request without giving a reason for its decision.[139]\nAmong his campaign positions, Barr distinguished himself strongly from Obama and McCain by opposing the financial bailout bill.[140]\nOn November 4, 2008, Barr received 523,686 votes, 0.4% of the national vote.[141]\n\nReturn to Republican Party[edit]\nBarr speaking at the 2016 FreedomFest in Las Vegas, Nevada\nFollowing his statement that he would not challenge the Republican incumbent in the 2012 primary race for Georgia's 14th congressional district, he subsequently indicated his return to the Republican Party and support for 2012 GOP congressional candidates when stating \u2013 \"Our country is at a serious cross-roads, without question we need new leadership in the White House, and a part of that turnaround in 2012 will be solid GOP majorities in both chambers of Congress.\"\n[142]\n\nAborted 2012 congressional campaign[edit]\nBarr had expressed interest in running for Congress again as a Republican in 2012, challenging incumbent Republican Tom Graves in Georgia's 14th district. The newly created district included Floyd and Paulding counties, which were part of the territory Barr represented in his first congressional stint. Between them, they made up 38 percent of the 14th's population. Barr has lived in Smyrna, in Cobb County, for many years, but told several friends he planned to move to Paulding County in order to challenge Graves.[143] Despite strong polling numbers, Barr chose to abandon his plans for running, citing concern on the potential impact it would have on his law firm and family.[142]\n\n2014 congressional campaign[edit]\nBarr held a news conference on March 28, 2013, at Adventure Outdoors in Smyrna, Georgia where he announced his upcoming run for his old congressional seat, the 11th. The seat had come open after his successor, Phil Gingrey, gave it up to run for Senate.[144] Barr was vying to become the first Georgia Republican to return to the U.S. House after a gap in service.[145] Barr placed second in his six-way House primary with 26% of the vote. State Senator Barry Loudermilk, who was backed by the Senate Conservatives Fund, placed first in the primary with 37%. Since no candidate won at least 50% (plus 1) of the vote, a runoff took place on July 22, 2014.[146] Barr lost the runoff to Loudermilk by a nearly 2:1 margin.[147]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of federal political sex scandals in the United States\nDefense of Marriage Act\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Mr. Robert Laurence Barr Jr\".
