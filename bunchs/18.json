He was formerly chief political correspondent for Slate. [2] David Uberti, writing in the Columbia Journalism Review in 2019, called Bouie \"one of the defining commentators on politics and race in the Trump era.\"[3]\n\n\nEarly and personal life[edit]\nBouie was born and raised in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He attended Floyd E. Kellam High School, from which he was graduated in 2005.[4] He graduated from the University of Virginia in 2009,[1] with a bachelor of arts degree and majors in political and social thought and government.[5][6] While there, he began blogging, which eventually led to interest in a career in journalism.[7]\nBouie previously lived and worked in Washington, D.C., and as of 2021[update], he is based in Charlottesville, Virginia.[7]\n\nCareer[edit]\nBouie was awarded a writing fellowship for The American Prospect in 2010. He was awarded a Knobler Fellowship at the Nation Institute by The Nation in 2012.[8] Bouie became a staff writer for The Daily Beast in 2013,[9] writing about national politics.[10] He moved to Slate as a chief political correspondent in 2014.[11][12] He joined The New York Times as a columnist in 2019.[13][14]\nBouie was a contributor to Barack Obama and the New America: The 2012 Election and the Changing Face of Politics,[15] a 2013 book edited by political scientist Larry Sabato.[16]\nBouie has been a political analyst on CBS News since 2015.[17][13] He frequently appears on Face the Nation,[18][19][20] the network's Sunday morning show,[21] and contributed to the network's 2016 election night coverage.[22]\nBouie writes articles focusing on history, public policy, and national politics, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[23] He also writes about entertainment, such as science fiction, comics, and film.[24] He has reviewed breakfast cereal for Serious Eats.[25]\nBouie has written extensively on racial politics,[26][27] including slavery in the United States and the American Civil War,[28] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[29][30] the Ferguson unrest,[31] the Charleston church shooting,[32] and the Black Lives Matter movement.[33] His writing on racial and national politics subjects is often quoted by other journalists.[34][35][36]\nShortly after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, he wrote an article for Slate arguing that there was \"no such thing as a good Trump voter.\" Several days earlier, he compared Trump voters to the \"angry, recalcitrant whites\" who resisted the Reconstruction era after the American Civil War.[37][38] He has criticized the media for an unwillingness to label racism in the United States as \"racist,\" opting instead for terms such as \"racial\" and \"racially charged.\"[39] He also criticized the media for its \"horse-race\" coverage of the 2016 presidential election.[40] He said the NPR interview between Noel King and Jason Kessler was \"absolute journalistic malpractice.\"[41]\nThe New York Times announced that Bouie would join their lineup of opinion columnists in January 2019. The newspaper stated that Bouie has \"consistently driven understanding of politics deeper by bringing not only a reporter\u2019s eye but also a historian\u2019s perspective and sense of proportion to bear on the news. His interests . . . range well beyond politics to the visual arts, food and movies.\"[42]\nIn January 2023, Bouie wrote an analysis of Florida Governor DeSantis' speeches in his national campaign for president. He suggested that Desantis was attempting to develop a populist narrative to draw voters away from former President Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary election without exposing his legislative history of favoring the wealthy. Bouie encouraged journalists to redirect the narrative toward topics avoided by Desantis but of more concern to many voters who would be adversely affected were his policies implemented.[43]\nBouie is also an accomplished photographer.[44] His first public photography exhibition, in 2019, focused on towns in Oklahoma founded by former slaves in the nineteenth century.[45] He shoots using both digital and film cameras.[46]\nWith John Ganz he hosts the Unclear and Present Danger podcast covering the political thriller films of the 1990s and exploring what they say about America's perception of the world in that era.[47]\n\nRecognition[edit]\nIn 2012, Bouie was chosen for The Root's Root Top 100.[48] The site stated that \"his is a strong, influential and necessary voice during the 2012 election season and beyond\".\nForbes recognized Bouie in its \"30 Under 30 \u2013 Media\" list in 2015, saying that \"he became a leading voice on the Ferguson story\".[49]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b One Hundred and Eightieth Final Exercises (PDF).

    "wiki": "American libertarian author and lecturer\n\n\nJames BovardBovard speaking in Washington, D.C. in 2011Born1956 (age\u00a067\u201368)\nJames Bovard (/b\u0259\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0rd/; born 1956) is an American libertarian author and lecturer whose political commentary targets examples of waste, failures, corruption, cronyism and abuses of power in government. He is a USA Today columnist[1] and is a frequent contributor to The Hill. He is the author of Attention Deficit Democracy and nine other books. He has written for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, New Republic, Reader's Digest, The American Conservative, and many other publications. His books have been translated into Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, and Korean.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nHe has written Wall Street Journal articles about his experiences as a shiftless highway worker [2] and a one-season Santa Claus.[3]  His early career was summarized in a 1988 National Journal profile headlined, \"A Free-Lance Crab Apple Shaking the Federal Tree\".[4]\n\nViews[edit]\nIn 2017, Bovard criticized President Donald Trump for the missile strike in Syria and referred to it as his \"biggest foreign folly.\" Bovard writes, \"Four years ago, Trump warned in a tweet: 'If the U.S. attacks Syria and hits the wrong targets, killing civilians, there will be worldwide hell to pay.' But the Trump administration has sharply increased U.S. bombing while curtailing restrictions that sought to protect innocents. A British-based human rights monitoring group estimated Friday that U.S.-led coalition strikes had killed almost 500 civilians in the past month\u2014more than any month since U.S. bombing began. A United Nations commission of inquiry concluded that coalition airstrikes have caused a 'staggering loss of civilian life.'\" He also stated that \"Trump's most dangerous innovation involves direct attacks on Syrian government forces.\"[5]\nIn 2018, Bovard was critical of Trump, saying that he \"has said and done many things to appall the friends of freedom. From Trump's pro-torture comments to his praise of police brutality to his cruise-missile barrage against Syria to his threat to annihilate North Korea, there are ample signs that he scorns a freedom-and-peace posture.\"[6]\nBovard is a critic of the TSA, writing that \"the TSA has a long history of intimidation. In 2002, it created a system of fines to penalize travelers with bad attitudes, charging up to $1,500 for any alleged 'nonphysical interference.' This included any 'situation that in any way would interfere with the screener and his or her ability to continue to work or interfere with their ability to do their jobs,' according to a spokeswoman. The TSA failed to specify exactly how much groveling was necessary and eventually abandoned the regime of fines.\" He also criticized the TSA's watchlist and concluded that \"the TSA's latest anti-privacy charade is yet more evidence that the agency should be done away with. After pointlessly groping countless Americans, the TSA has no excuse for groping more.\"[7]\n\nMedia mentions[edit]\nGeorge Will, writing in The Washington Post, called Bovard \"a one-man truth squad\".[8] A 1999 book review in the Wall Street Journal called him \"the roving inspector general of the modern state\".[9] The New York Times in 2007 called Bovard \"an anti-czar czar.\"[10] A Washington Post columnist on criminal justice referred in 2017 to the \"great writer and civil liberties advocate James Bovard\".[11] He discussed the War on Terror in a one-hour interview on CSPAN's Washington Journal in 2016.[12]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nThe Farm Fiasco. ICS Press, 1989. ISBN\u00a01558150013 Reason magazine declared, \"Over the past few years Bovard, in a series of newspaper and magazine articles, has contributed more than anyone to the public's understanding of our farm program madness. With this book, he presents the ultimate Everyman's defense of a free market in agriculture.\"[13] The Washington Post noted, \"Although [The Farm Fiasco] may sound like a critique of Soviet farm policy, in fact it is American programs at which James Bovard has taken aim.\"[14]\nFair Trade Fraud: How Congress Pillages the Consumer and Decimates American Competitiveness. Palgrave Macmillan. 1992. ISBN\u00a00312083440. A Wall Street Journal review declared, \"Bovard offers a smashing condemnation of American trade policy and exposes the corrupt core of protectionism and the absurdity of Congress making trade more 'fair' by making it less 'free'. ... (shows) how arbitrary and ultimately counterproductive and restrictive our trade practices are.\"[15]\nLost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty. Palgrave Macmillan. 1995. ISBN\u00a00312123337. A Wall Street Journal review declared, \"Bovard's unrivaled research has resulted in a virtual encyclopedia of modern government abuse.\"[16] The American Spectator declared, \"A remarkable book \u2013 400 densely packed pages about the mounting war on property and contract, the tyranny of taxation, and the growth of federal power in the guise of expanding our rights. In this field, Bovard is surely the leading researcher in the country.... brilliant.\"[17] In a 1998 Vanity Fair article on \"Shredding the Bill of Rights,\" novelist Gore Vidal quoted extensively from the book, \"In James Bovard's 1994 book, Lost Rights, the author has assembled a great deal of material on just what our law enforcers are up to in the never-to-be-won wars against Drugs and Terrorism, as they do daily battle with the American people in their homes and cars, on buses and planes, indeed, wherever they can get at them, by hook or by crook or by sting.\"[18] A 2012 National Review article declared, \"Lost Rights expos\u00e9 of the threat posed by an emerging bureaucratic police state remains a true classic.\"[19] The book won the 1995 Mencken Award for Best Book. [20]\n(1996) Shakedown\nFreedom in Chains: The Rise of the State and the Demise of the Citizen. Palgrave Macmillan. 2000. ISBN\u00a00312229674. The Los Angeles Times labeled Freedom in Chains \"a chilling indictment of the U.S. government.\"[21] The Wall Street Journal declared, \"Never has so much theoretical error and concrete folly been collected and juxtaposed so well under a single cover. Mr. Bovard consistently illuminates the connection between faulty political ideals and specific policy disasters.\"[9] Publishers Weekly declared, \"Bovard is well-read and makes entertaining use of Rousseau, Hegel, Hobbes (he's very fond of Leviathan) and other thinkers. He's also consistent and intellectually honest enough to follow his own ideology to its logical conclusion about, for instance, marijuana (legalize it, he says). Few readers will agree with Bovard that the dominant spirit in America today is one that idolizes the state, but most will find that he makes a rousing theoretical case against statism.\"[22]\nFeeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years. Palgrave Macmillan. 2001. ISBN\u00a0031224052X. A Wall Street Journal review declared, \"Feeling Your Pain is an eloquent and blistering indictment of the politicians and bureaucrats who, armed with taxpayer dollars and the coercive power of law, have done so much damage to individual lives, and society at large, in recent years.\"[23] Insight Magazine commented, \"In his powerful new book 'feeling your pain,' free-lance investigative reporter James Bovard takes on the whole eight years of the Clinton/Gore era and details the administration's misuse of power and its enormously successful effort to expand the role of government in our lives.\"[24][25]\nTerrorism and Tyranny: Trampling Freedom, Justice, and Peace to Rid the World of Evil. Palgrave Macmillan. 2003. ISBN\u00a01403966826. A Boston Globe review declared \"\"Terrorism and Tyranny is a scathing account of the war on terrorism... Bovard is a bipartisan scourge... His lively fury at government incompetence keeps the pages turning quickly... Most riveting.\"[26] Publishers Weekly declared, \"Journalist Bovard, who has written for the 'Wall Street Journal' and The American Spectator, among others, looks at the post\u2013September 11 policies and actions of the government and finds them sorely lacking.... Meticulously documented from contemporary news accounts, this rant against Bush's \"aura of righteousness\" may well leave readers as angry as its author.\"[27]  'The Washington Times' declared, \"The author has synthesized and organized a vast amount of information, yet he presents it in an accessible, reader-friendly way. It is rare to read such a well-documented study that flows so smoothly.... Terrorism and Tyranny\" is a timely, troubling book, exhaustively and impeccably researched and documented.\"[28] The Washington Post noted, \"The controversial author of Feeling Your Pain takes on Bush, the war with Iraq and the official drive to protect 'the homeland.'\"[29]\nThe Bush Betrayal. Palgrave Macmillan. 2004. ISBN\u00a01403968519. Publishers Weekly declared, \"Writing from a libertarian perspective, Bovard (Terrorism and Tyranny, etc.) offers a fierce critique of the presidency of George W. Bush, focusing on restrictions on liberty and expansion of government.... It is notable as a comprehensive attack on the administration from a less-often-heard place on the political spectrum.\"[30]  An American Conservative review declared, \"With the thoroughly researched and footnoted style that has become his forte, and with the heavy doses of relevant anecdotes and dry humor that have become his trademarks, the author has compiled a virtual almanac of American political abuse.\"[31]\nAttention Deficit Democracy. Palgrave Macmillan. 2006. ISBN\u00a01403971080. The American Conservative declared, \"In nine books and hundreds of articles, the libertarian muckraker James Bovard has returned repeatedly to three themes: government repression, government incompetence, and government deceit. All three go under the microscope in his newest tome, Attention Deficit Democracy, but the focus is on the deceit-and, even more, on the deceived.\"[32] Publishers Weekly declared, \"Bovard describes problems in painstaking detail.... those looking for a rousing refresher on the merits of skepticism will find it here in spades.\"[33]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"USA Today\".

A former Marine Corps four-star general, he commanded forces in the Persian Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War.\nMattis was commissioned in the Marine Corps through the Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps after graduating from Central Washington University. A career Marine, he gained a reputation among his peers for intellectualism and eventually advanced to the rank of general. From 2007 to 2010, he commanded the United States Joint Forces Command and concurrently served as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Transformation. He was commander of United States Central Command from 2010 to 2013, with Admiral Bob Harward serving as his deputy commander. After retiring from the military, he served in several private sector roles, including as a board member of Theranos.[6]\nMattis was nominated as secretary of defense by president-elect Donald Trump, and confirmed by the Senate on January 20, 2017. As secretary of defense, Mattis affirmed the United States' commitment to defending longtime ally South Korea in the wake of the 2017 North Korea crisis.[7][8] An opponent of proposed collaboration with China and Russia,[9] Mattis stressed what he saw as their \"threat to the American-led world order\".[10] Mattis occasionally voiced his disagreement with certain Trump administration policies such as the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal,[11] withdrawals of troops from Syria and Afghanistan,[12] and budget cuts hampering the ability to monitor the impacts of climate change.[13][14] According to The Hill, Mattis also reportedly dissuaded Trump from attempting to assassinate Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria.[15]\nOn December 20, 2018, after failing to convince Trump to reconsider his decision to withdraw all American troops from Syria, Mattis announced his resignation effective the end of February 2019; after Mattis's resignation generated significant media coverage, Trump abruptly accelerated Mattis' departure date to January 1, 2019, stating that he had essentially fired Mattis.[16]\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nMattis was born on September 8, 1950, in Pullman, Washington.[17] He is the son of Lucille (Proulx) Mattis (1922\u20132019)[18] and John West Mattis (1915\u20131988),[19][20] a merchant mariner. His mother immigrated to the United States from Canada as an infant and had worked in Army Intelligence in South Africa during the Second World War.[21] Mattis's father moved to Richland, Washington, to work at a plant supplying fissile material to the Manhattan Project. Mattis was raised in a bookish household that did not own a television.[22][23] He graduated from Richland High School in 1968.[22][24] He earned a Bachelor of Arts in history from Central Washington University in 1971[25][26][27] and a Master of Arts in international security affairs from the National War College of National Defense University in 1994.[28]\n\nMarine career[edit]\nMattis addressing Marines at Camp Commando, Kuwait during Operation Enduring Freedom in February 2003.\nMattis enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve in 1969.[29] He was commissioned a second lieutenant through the Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps on January 1, 1972.[30] During his service years, Mattis was considered an \"intellectual\" among the upper ranks.[31] Robert H. Scales, a retired United States Army major general, called him \"one of the most urbane and polished men I have known.\"[32] As a lieutenant, Mattis was assigned as a rifle and weapons platoon commander in the 3rd Marine Division. As a captain, he was assigned as the Naval Academy Preparatory School's Battalion Officer, commanded rifle and weapons companies in the 1st Marine Regiment, then served at Recruiting Station Portland, Oregon, as a major.[33] \nUpon promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel, Mattis commanded 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, one of Task Force Ripper's assault battalions during the Gulf War.[34] As a colonel, Mattis commanded the 7th Marine Regiment from June 28, 1994, to June 14, 1996.[35]\n\nOfficial portrait as Supreme Allied Commander Transformation\nMattis is a graduate of the US Marine Corps Amphibious Warfare School, US Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and the National War College. He is noted for his interest in the study of military history and world history,[36][37] with a personal library that once included over 7,000 volumes,[2] and a penchant for publishing required reading lists for Marines under his command.[38][39] He required his Marines to be well-read in the culture and history of regions where they were deployed, and had his Marines deploying to Iraq undergo \"cultural sensitivity training\".[37] According to an article published in 2004 by the Los Angeles Times it was his concern for the enlisted ranks along with his energy and enthusiasm that garnered him the nickname \"Mad Dog\".[4][5] But in 2016, when President-elect Trump asked Mattis if his nickname was indeed \"Mad Dog,\" Mattis replied, \"No, sir,\" saying that his actual nickname was \"Chaos.\"[40]\n\nWar in Afghanistan[edit]\nFurther information: War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)\nMattis led the 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade as its commanding officer upon promotion to brigadier general.[41] It was as a regimental commander that he earned his nickname and call sign, \"CHAOS\", an acronym for \"Colonel Has Another Outstanding Solution\", which was initially somewhat tongue-in-cheek.[42][23]\nDuring the initial planning for the War in Afghanistan, Mattis led Task Force 58 in operations in the southern part of the country beginning in November 2001,[43] becoming the first Marine Corps officer to command a Naval Task Force in combat.[30] According to Mattis, his objective upon arriving in Afghanistan was \"make sure that the enemy didn't feel like they had any safe haven, to destroy their sense of security in southern Afghanistan, to isolate Kandahar from its lines of communication, and to move against Kandahar.\"[44] In December 2001, an airstrike carried out by a B-52 bomber inadvertently targeted a position held by US special operations troops and Afghan militiamen in Uruzgan Province. Numerous men were wounded in the incident, but Mattis repeatedly refused to dispatch helicopters from the nearby Camp Rhino to recover them, citing operational safety concerns. Instead,  an Air Force helicopter flew from Uzbekistan to ferry the men to the Marine Corps base where helicopters sat readily available but unauthorized to fly. Captain Jason Amerine blamed the delay caused by Mattis's refusal to order a rescue operation for the deaths of several men. Amerine wrote, \"Every element in Afghanistan tried to help us except the closest friendly unit, commanded by Mattis,\" though he also wrote that \"none of that was assessed properly because the [5th Special Forces Group] chose not to call for a formal investigation\".[45][46] This episode was used against Mattis when he was nominated for defense secretary in 2016.[47]\nMattis describes being presented with the location of Osama bin Laden in December 2001 and creating a plan to kill him that was never executed.[23]\nWhile serving in Afghanistan as a brigadier general, Mattis was known as an officer who engaged his men with \"real leadership.\"[48] A young Marine officer, Nathaniel Fick, said he witnessed Mattis in a fighting hole talking with a sergeant and lance corporal: \"No one would have questioned Mattis if he'd slept eight hours each night in a private room, to be woken each morning by an aide who ironed his uniforms and heated his MREs. But there he was, in the middle of a freezing night, out on the lines with his Marines.\"[49]\n\nIraq War[edit]\nLetter written by Mattis on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, addressed to members of the 1st Marine Division\nAs a major general, Mattis commanded the 1st Marine Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the Iraq War.[36] Mattis played key roles in combat operations in Fallujah, including negotiation with the insurgent command inside the city during Operation Vigilant Resolve in April 2004, as well as participation in planning of the subsequent Operation Phantom Fury in November.[50]\n\nWedding bombing[edit]\nIn May 2004, Mattis ordered the 3\u00a0a.m. bombing of what his intelligence section had reported was a suspected enemy safe house near the Syrian border, but was later reported to be a wedding party and allegedly resulted in the deaths of 42 civilians, including 11 women and 14 children. Mattis said it had taken him 30 seconds to decide whether to bomb the location. Describing the wedding as implausible, he said, \"How many people go to the middle of the desert to hold a wedding 80 miles (130\u00a0km) from the nearest civilization? These were more than two dozen military-age males. Let's not be naive.\"[51] The occurrence of a wedding was disputed by military officials, but the Associated Press obtained video footage showing a wedding party and a video the next day showed musical instruments and party decoration among the remains.[52] When asked by the press about footage on Arabic television of a child's body being lowered into a grave, he replied: \"I have not seen the pictures but bad things happen in wars. I don't have to apologize for the conduct of my men.\"[53]\n\nDepartment of Defense survey[edit]\nFollowing a Department of Defense survey that showed only 55% of US soldiers and 40% of Marines would report a colleague for abusing civilians, Mattis told Marines in May 2007 that \"whenever you show anger or disgust toward civilians, it's a victory for al-Qaeda and other insurgents.\" Believing that a need for restraint in war as key to defeating an insurgency, he added: \"every time you wave at an Iraqi civilian, al-Qaeda rolls over in its grave.\"[54]\n\n1st Marine Division's motto \"no better friend, no worse enemy\"[edit]\nMattis popularized the 1st Marine Division's motto \"no better friend, no worse enemy\", a paraphrase of the epitaph the Roman dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla wrote for himself,[55] in his open letter to all men within the division for their return to Iraq. This phrase later became widely publicized during the investigation into the conduct of Lieutenant Ilario Pantano, a platoon commander serving under Mattis.[56][57][58][59][60]\n\nCultural sensitivity training[edit]\nAs his division prepared to ship out, Mattis called in \"experts on the Middle East\" for \"cultural sensitivity training.\" He constantly toured the battlefield to tell stories of Marines who were able to show \"discretion in moments of high pressure.\" As an apparent example, he encouraged his Marines to grow moustaches to look more like the people they were working with.[37]\n\nRemoval of senior leaders[edit]\nHe was also noted for a willingness to remove senior leaders under his command when the US military seemed unable or unwilling to relieve underperforming or incompetent officers. During the division's push to Baghdad, Mattis relieved Colonel Joe D. Dowdy, commander of Regimental Combat Team-1. It was such a rare occurrence in the modern military that it made the front page of newspapers. Despite this, Mattis declined to comment on the matter publicly other than to say that the practice of officer relief remains alive, or at least \"we are doing it in the Marines.\"[49] Later interviews of Dowdy's officers and men revealed that \"the colonel was doomed partly by an age-old wartime tension: Men versus mission\u2014in which he favored his men,\" while Mattis insisted on execution of the mission to seize Baghdad swiftly.[61]\n\nCombat Development Command[edit]\nAfter being promoted to lieutenant general, Mattis took command of Marine Corps Combat Development Command. In February 2005, speaking at a forum in San Diego, he said, \"Actually it's quite fun to fight them, you know. It's a hell of a hoot. It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling. You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.\"[62] Mattis's remarks sparked controversy; General Michael Hagee, commandant of the Marine Corps, issued a statement suggesting Mattis should have chosen his words more carefully, but he would not be disciplined.[63]\n\nUS Joint Forces Command[edit]\nVice President Joe Biden, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Admiral Mike Mullen and General Mattis in Baghdad, Iraq, September 2010\nThe Pentagon announced on May 31, 2006, that Mattis had been chosen to take command of the I Marine Expeditionary Force, based out of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.[64] On September 11, 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that President George W. Bush had nominated Mattis for appointment to the rank of general to command US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) in Norfolk, Virginia. NATO agreed to appoint Mattis as Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT). On September 28, 2007, the United States Senate confirmed Mattis's nomination, and he relinquished command of the I MEF on November 5, 2007, to Lieutenant General Samuel Helland.[33]\nMattis was promoted to four-star general and took control of USJFCOM/SACT on November 9, 2007. On September 9, 2009, French Air Force General St\u00e9phane Abrial assumed the position of SACT. Mattis remained commander of JFCOM from November 2007 until September 2010.[65]\n\nUS Central Command[edit]\nGeneral Lloyd Austin and Command Sgt. Maj. Joseph R. Allen greet Mattis as he arrives in Baghdad for the end-of-mission ceremony in December 2011.\nIn early 2010, Mattis was reported to be on the list of generals being considered to replace James T. Conway as the commandant of the US Marine Corps.[66] In July, he was recommended by Defense Secretary Robert Gates for nomination to replace David Petraeus as commander of United States Central Command (CENTCOM),[17][67] and formally nominated by President Obama on July 21.[68]\nMattis took command at a ceremony at MacDill Air Force Base on August 11.[69][70][71] As head of Central Command, Mattis oversaw the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was responsible for a region that includes Syria, Iran, and Yemen.[72] He lobbied the Obama administration for a more aggressive response to Iran, including more covert operations and disruption of Iranian arms shipments to Syria and Yemen.[73] After an incident in 2011 where an Iranian jet had attacked a U.S. drone flying over the Persian Gulf in international airspace, Mattis wanted permission to shoot down any Iranian aircraft that was attacking American drones, but the Obama administration denied this request.[74] According to Leon Panetta, the Obama administration did not place much trust in Mattis because he was perceived as too eager for a military confrontation with Iran.[75] Panetta later said, though, that some of the mistrust was unjustified, arising from the inexperience of some White House staff not understanding the need \"to look at all of the options that a president should look at in order to make the right decisions.\" Nevertheless, Mattis's hawkishness was out of step with the White House's perspective, and \"ultimately, Mattis\u2019s advocacy and aggressive style alienated the White House and the president he was serving.\"[76]\nMattis retired in March 2013, and the Defense Department nominated General Lloyd Austin to succeed him.[77]\n\nCivilian career[edit]\nAfter retiring from the military, Mattis worked for FWA Consultants and served as a member of the General Dynamics Board of Directors.[78] Between 2013 and 2017, while on the board of General Dynamics, Mattis made more than $900,000 in compensation, including company stock.[79] In August 2013, he was appointed an Annenberg Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution[80] and in 2016 he was named the Davies Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow.[81][23]\nIn December 2015, Mattis joined the advisory board[82] of Spirit of America, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that provides assistance to support the safety and success of American service personnel and the local people they seek to help.\nHe is co-editor of the book Warriors & Citizens: American Views of Our Military, published in August 2016.[83]\nFrom 2013 to January 2017, Mattis was a board member of Theranos, a health technology company that claimed to have devised revolutionary blood tests using very small amounts of blood, which was later determined to be a fraudulent claim by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.[84][85][86][87][88] Previously, in mid-2012, a Department of Defense official evaluating Theranos's blood-testing technology for the military initiated a formal inquiry with the Food and Drug Administration about the company's intent to distribute its tests without FDA clearance. In August 2012, Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes asked Mattis, who had expressed interest in testing Theranos's technology in combat areas, to help. Within hours, Mattis forwarded his email exchange with Holmes to military officials, asking \"how do we overcome this new obstacle\". In July 2013, the Department of Defense gave Mattis permission to join Theranos's board provided he did not represent Theranos with regard to the blood-testing device and its potential acquisition by the Departments of the Navy or Defense.[89]\nIn 2019, Mattis's book Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead was published.[90] It is an autobiography as well as an argument in favor of an internationalist foreign policy.[91] On August 7, 2019, Mattis was re-elected to the board of General Dynamics.[92]\n\nSecretary of Defense (2017\u20132019)[edit]\nNomination and confirmation[edit]\nMattis with President Trump and Vice President Pence\nPresident-elect Donald Trump met with Mattis for a little over one hour in Bedminster, New Jersey, on November 20, 2016.[93] He later wrote on Twitter, \"General James 'Mad Dog' Mattis, who is being considered for secretary of defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!\"[94] On December 1, 2016, Trump announced at a rally in Cincinnati that he would nominate Mattis for secretary of defense.[95]\nThe National Security Act of 1947 requires a seven-year waiting period before retired military personnel can assume the role of secretary of defense; Mattis's nomination meant that it was the first time since 1950 (in that instance for George Marshall) that a waiver of the law was needed.[95][96] The waiver for Mattis passed 81\u201317 in the Senate and 268\u2013151 in the House. Mattis was subsequently confirmed as secretary of defense by a vote of 98\u20131 in the United States Senate on January 20, 2017.[97] Senator Kirsten Gillibrand was the sole \"no\" vote,[98] stating that she was opposed to the waiver on principle.[99]\n\nTenure[edit]\nMattis with Finnish president Sauli Niinist\u00f6 in Helsinki, Finland, in November 2017\nMattis and Turkish Defense Minister Fikri I\u015f\u0131k at NATO headquarters in Brussels, February 2017\nMattis with Indonesian president Joko Widodo during a visit to Jakarta, Indonesia, in January 2018.\nIn a January 2017 phone call with Saudi Arabia's deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, Mattis \"reaffirmed the importance of the US\u2013Saudi Arabia strategic relationship\".[100]\nFor his first official trip abroad, Mattis began a two-day visit with longtime US ally South Korea on February 2, 2017.[7] He warned North Korea that \"any attack on the United States, or our allies, will be defeated\", and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with an \"effective and overwhelming\" response from the United States.[8] During a press conference in London on March 31, 2017, with the British secretary of state for defence, Michael Fallon, Mattis said North Korea was behaving \"in a very reckless manner\" and must be stopped.[101] During a Pentagon news conference on May 26, Mattis reported the US was working with the UN, China, Japan, and South Korea to avoid \"a military solution\" with North Korea.[102] On June 3, Mattis said the United States regarded North Korea as \"clear and present danger\" during a speech at the international security conference in Singapore.[103] In a June 12 written statement to the House Armed Services Committee Mattis said North Korea was the \"most urgent and dangerous threat to peace and security\".[104] On June 15, Mattis said the US would win a war against North Korea, but \"at great cost\".[105]\nOn March 22, 2017, during questioning from the US Senate, Mattis affirmed his support for US troops remaining in Iraq after the Battle of Mosul was concluded.[106] Mattis responded to critics who suggested the Trump administration had loosened the rules of engagement for the US military in Iraq after US-led coalition airstrikes in Mosul killed civilians,[107] saying, \"We go out of our way to always do everything humanly possible to reduce the loss of life or injury among innocent people.\"[108] According to Airwars, the US-led coalition killed as many as 6,000 civilians in Iraq and Syria in 2017.[109]\n\nMattis and Australian Minister for Defense Marise Payne visiting Victoria Barracks in Sydney, Australia, June 2017.\nOn April 5, 2017, Mattis called the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack \"a heinous act,\" and said it would be treated accordingly.[110] On April 10, Mattis warned the Syrian government against using chemical weapons again.[111] The following day, Mattis gave his first Pentagon news conference since becoming secretary of defense, saying ISIL's defeat remained \"our priority,\" and the Syrian government would pay a \"very, very stiff price\" for further usage of chemical weapons.[112] On April 21 Mattis said Syria still had chemical weapons and was in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.[113] According to investigative journalist Bob Woodward, Trump ordered Mattis to assassinate Assad, but Mattis refused.[114] On May 8 Mattis told reporters details of the proposed Syrian safe zones were \"all in process right now\" and the United States was involved with configuring them.[115]\nMattis voiced support for a Saudi Arabian-led military campaign against Yemen's Shiite rebels.[116] He asked Trump to remove restrictions on US military support for Saudi Arabia.[117]\nOn April 20, 2017, one week after the Nangarhar airstrike, Mattis told reporters that the US would not conduct a damage assessment \"in terms of the number of people killed\" in Afghanistan.[118] Mattis traveled to Afghanistan days later and met with government officials, explaining that the purpose of the trip was to allow him to state his recommendations for US strategy in the country.[119] On June 13, Mattis said US forces were \"not winning\" in Afghanistan and the administration would develop a new strategy by \"mid-July\" while speaking to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services.[120] On June 29, Mattis said the Obama administration \"may have pulled our troops out too rapidly\" and that he intended to submit a new Afghanistan strategy to Trump upon his return to Washington, D.C.[121]\nThe United States has been openly arming the Syrian Kurdish fighters in the war against ISIL since May 2017.[122] Following the start of the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed at ousting US-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin, Mattis said in January 2018: \"Turkey is a NATO ally. It's the only NATO country with an active insurgency inside its borders. And Turkey has legitimate security concerns.\"[123] Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozda\u011f urged the United States to halt its support for Kurdish YPG fighters, saying: \"Those who support the terrorist organization will become a target in this battle.\"[124]\nOn April 13, 2018, Mattis briefed reporters in a press conference at the Pentagon on the 2018 missile strikes against Syria being carried out against the Assad regime's chemical weapon compounds, saying, \"Tonight, France, the United Kingdom and the United States took decisive action to strike the Syrian chemical weapons infrastructure. Clearly the Assad regime did not get the message last year. This time our allies and we have struck harder. Together we have sent a clear message to Assad and his murderous lieutenants that they should not perpetrate another chemical weapons attack for which they will be held accountable\".[125]\nIn November 2018, the CIA assessed with \"high confidence\" that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman ordered the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.[126] Under mounting pressure from lawmakers who wanted action against Saudi Arabia, Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a rare closed briefing of the Senate, disputed the CIA's conclusion and declared there was no direct evidence linking the crown prince to Khashoggi's assassination.[127]\nWherever Mattis traveled overseas, he brought the Defense Security Cooperation Agency director (the official in charge of weapon sales to foreign governments), according to Lt. Gen. Charles Hooper, speaking at the Brookings Institution in June 2019.[128]\n\nConflicts with Trump and resignation[edit]\nMattis's resignation letter\nMattis had recommended General David L. Goldfein, Air Force Chief of Staff, to succeed retiring General Joseph Dunford as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September 2018. Instead, Trump chose General Mark Milley, Army Chief of Staff, whom Mattis had recommended for the position of Supreme Allied Commander Europe.[129][130]\nOn December 19, 2018, Trump announced immediate US withdrawal from Syria, over his national security advisers' objections.[131] Mattis had recently said that the US would remain in Syria after ISIL's defeat to ensure it did not regroup. The next day, he submitted his resignation after failing to persuade Trump to reconsider.[132][133] His resignation letter contained language that appeared to criticize Trump's worldview\u2014praising NATO, which Trump has often derided, and the 79-nation anti-ISIS coalition that Trump had decided to abandon. Mattis also affirmed the need for \"treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors\" and remaining \"resolute and unambiguous\" against authoritarian states such as China and Russia. He wrote that Trump has \"the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with [his] on these and other subjects.\"[134][135] His resignation triggered alarm among historical allies.[136] In his 2018 resignation letter, Mattis called both Russia and China \"authoritarian models\" rivaling US interests.[137] Mattis's letter said his resignation would be effective February 28, 2019.[138] Three days later Trump moved Mattis's departure date up to January 1, after becoming angered by the implicit criticism of Trump's worldview in Mattis's letter.[139] On January 2, 2019, Trump criticized Mattis's performance as secretary of defense and said he had \"essentially fired him.\"[140]\nJohn F. Kelly, Trump's chief of staff when Mattis left his position, denied that Trump fired Mattis or asked for his resignation. He said Trump must be confused or mistaken, and that \"Jim Mattis is an honorable man.\"[141]  Mattis returned to his post as Davies Family Distinguished Fellow at the Hoover Institution. [142]\n\nPost-tenure[edit]\nAfter leaving the White House, Mattis initially declined to offer his opinion of the Trump administration, saying, \"If you leave an administration, you owe some silence,\"[143] and was guarded when asked to reflect on Trump or military matters, saying he didn't want to detract from the troops.[144] He changed his position after becoming \"angry and appalled\" about the events leading up to the violent treatment of noncombative protesters near the White House on June 1, 2020, for the purpose of a photo op for Trump at the church across Lafayette Square.[145] Trump responded by Twitter that evening that he \"felt great\" he had previously asked Mattis to resign, and he didn't like much about Mattis or his \"leadership style\" and was \"Glad he is gone!\"[144]\nIn 2019, Mattis joined The Cohen Group as senior counsel.[146][147][148]\nMattis, along with all other living former secretaries of defense, ten in total, published a Washington Post op-ed piece in January 2021 telling President Trump not to involve the military in determining the outcome of the 2020 elections.[149]\n\nAl Smith Dinner comments[edit]\nAt the October 17, 2019, Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Mattis, the keynote speaker, responded to comments Trump had made about him, saying,\n\n\nI'm not just an overrated general, I am the greatest, the world's most overrated\u00a0... I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump, because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals, and frankly, that sounds pretty good to me. And you do have to admit that between me and Meryl, at least we've had some victories.[150]\n\n\nHe continued, \"I've earned my spurs on the battlefield\u00a0... Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.\"[151]\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nMattis claims he has \"never registered for any political party\". He also claims when he was 18 that he was \"proudly apolitical\".[152]\n\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian peace process[edit]\nMattis supports a two-state solution model for Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace. He has said the situation in Israel is \"unsustainable\" and that Israeli settlements harm prospects for peace and could lead to an apartheid-like situation in the West Bank.[153] In particular, he has said that the perception of biased American support for Israel has made it difficult for moderate Arabs to show support for the United States. Mattis strongly supported Secretary of State John Kerry on the Middle East peace process, praising Kerry for being \"wisely focused like a laser beam\" on a two-state solution.[154]\n\nIran and Middle Eastern allies[edit]\nMattis and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in April 2017\nMattis believes Iran is the principal threat to the stability of the Middle East, ahead of Al-Qaeda and ISIL. Mattis says: \"I consider ISIS nothing more than an excuse for Iran to continue its mischief. Iran is not an enemy of ISIS. They have a lot to gain from the turmoil in the region that ISIS creates.\" Mattis sees the Iran nuclear deal as a poor agreement, but believes there is now no way to tear it up, saying: \"We are just going to have to recognize that we have an imperfect arms control agreement. Second, that what we achieved is a nuclear pause, not a nuclear halt\". Mattis argues that inspections may fail to prevent Iran from seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but that \"[i]f nothing else at least we will have better-targeting data if it comes to a fight in the future.\"[11] Additionally, he criticized Obama for being \"naive\" about Iranian intentions and Congress for being \"pretty much absent\" on the nuclear deal.[155]\n\nMattis with Saudi Arabia's prince Mohammad in March 2017\nMattis praises the friendship of regional US allies such as Jordan, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates.[156][157][158] He also criticized Obama for seeing allies as \"freeloading\", saying: \"For a sitting US President to see our allies as freeloaders is nuts.\"[158] He has cited the importance of the United Arab Emirates and Jordan as countries that wanted to help, for example, in filling in the gaps in Afghanistan. He criticized Obama's defense strategy as giving \"the perception we're pulling back\" from US allies.[159] He stresses the need for the US to bolster its ties with allied intelligence agencies, particularly those of Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.[160] In 2012, Mattis argued for providing weapons to Syrian rebels as a way to fight back against Iranian proxies in Syria.[161]\n\nJapan[edit]\nMattis visited Japan one week after being sworn in as secretary of defense. During a meeting with Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe, Mattis emphasized that the US remains committed to the mutual defense of Japan and stated, \"I want there to be no misunderstanding during the transition in Washington that we stand firmly, 100 percent, shoulder to shoulder with you and the Japanese people.\"[162] He also reassured Japan that the US would defend the disputed Senkaku Islands controlled by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan.[163]\n\nRussia[edit]\nSpeaking at a 2015 conference sponsored by The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., Mattis said he believed that Russian President Vladimir Putin's intent is \"to break NATO apart.\"[164] Mattis has also spoken out against what he perceives as Russia's expansionist or bellicose policies in Syria, Ukraine and the Baltic states.[165] In 2017, Mattis said that the world order is \"under the biggest attack since World War II, ... and that is from Russia, from terrorist groups, and with what China is doing in the South China Sea.[166]\nOn February 16, 2017, Mattis said the United States was not currently prepared to collaborate with Russia on military matters, including future anti-ISIL US operations.[9] In August 2017, he said: \"Despite Russia's denials, we know they are seeking to redraw international borders by force, undermining the sovereign and free nations of Europe\".[167]\nOn July 1, 2022, he described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as \"immoral, the tactically incompetent, operationally stupid and strategically foolish effort\". He added that Vladimir Putin \"probably thought that the Ukrainian people were going to welcome him.\"[168]\n\nMattis and Tillerson with Chinese General Fang Fenghui and State Councilor Yang Jiechi, June 2017\nChina[edit]\nMattis called for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and criticized China's island-building activities, saying: \"The bottom line is\u00a0... the international waters are international waters.\"[169]\n\nClimate change[edit]\nSee also: Climate security\nIn 2017, Mattis said that budget cuts would hamper the ability to monitor the effects of global warming,[13] and noted, \"climate change is a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of-government response.\"[170] He also told senators \"climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today.\"[171]\n\n2020 George Floyd protests[edit]\nSee also: George Floyd protests\nOn June 3, 2020, Mattis issued a statement to The Atlantic in which he criticized President Donald Trump and his policies during the George Floyd protests. He berated Trump for deliberately trying to cause division among the American people and advocating military action to \"dominate\" the country's protests. \"Militarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a conflict\u2014a false conflict\u2014between the military and civilian society, and diminishes the trust and constitutional relationship between the armed services and the civilian population they support\", he wrote. Mattis called for reunification among the people, regardless of the president, to preserve the welfare of society, and its future.[145]\nMattis wrote that Trump was \"the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people\u2014does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us\". He added that America is \"witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership\". He called for accountability for \"those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution.\" He concluded, \"Only by adopting a new path\u2014which means, in truth, returning to the original path of our founding ideals\u2014will we again be a country admired and respected at home and abroad.\"[172][145][173][174]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nA bachelor for his entire professional career, Mattis married physicist and business executive Christina Lomasney[175] in June 2022.[176] He has no children.[2] He previously proposed to a woman, but she called off the wedding three days before it was to occur, after colleagues talked him out of leaving the Marine Corps for her.[22][177] He was nicknamed \"The Warrior Monk\" because of his bachelorhood and lifelong devotion to the study of war.[178] An avid reader, he has 7,000 books in his private library,[179] and has recommended Marcus Aurelius's Meditations as the one book every American should read.[180]\nMattis was inducted into the Sons of the American Revolution on July 13, 2021.\nMattis is a Catholic, and has been described as \"devout\"[181] and \"committed\".[182] During the 2003 Iraq invasion, he often prayed with general John F. Kelly on Sundays.[181] The Trump transition team's formal biography of Mattis described him as \"the living embodiment of the Marine Corps motto, Semper Fidelis.\"[182] He has declined when asked by reporters to discuss his faith in public.[183] In a 2003 PBS interview, Mattis recalled how his Marines followed advice from his chaplain on gaining the support of Iraqi citizens:\n\n\nOn the suggestion of my Catholic chaplain the Marines would take chilled drinking water in bottles and walk out amongst the protesters and hand it out. It is just hard to throw a rock at somebody who has given you a cold drink of water and it's 120 degrees outside.[182]\n\n\nMilitary awards[edit]\nMattis's decorations, awards, and badges include, among others:\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st row\n\nDefense Distinguished Service Medal w/ one oak leaf cluster\n\nNavy Distinguished Service Medal\n\nDefense Superior Service Medal\n\nLegion of Merit\n\n\n2nd row\n\nBronze Star Medal w/ Combat \"V\"\n\nMeritorious Service Medal w/ two 5\u204416\" Gold Stars\n\nNavy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal\n\nCombat Action Ribbon\n\n\n3rd row\n\nNavy and Marine Corps Presidential Unit Citation\n\nJoint Meritorious Unit Award\n\nNavy Unit Commendation\n\nNavy and Marine Corps Meritorious Unit Commendation\n\n\n4th row\n\nMarine Corps Expeditionary Medal\n\nNational Defense Service Medal w/ two 3\u204416\" bronze stars\n\nSouthwest Asia Service Medal w/ two 3\u204416\" bronze stars\n\nAfghanistan Campaign Medal w/ one 3\u204416\" bronze star\n\n\n5th row\n\nIraq Campaign Medal w/ one 3\u204416\" bronze star\n\nGlobal War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal\n\nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal\n\nHumanitarian Service Medal\n\n\n6th row\n\nSea Service Ribbon w/ one 3\u204416\" silver star and two 3\u204416\" bronze stars\n\nMarine Corps Recruiting Service Ribbon w/ one 3\u204416\" bronze star\n\nPolish Army Medal in gold\n\nNATO Meritorious Service Medal[65]\n\n\n7th row\n\nNATO Medal for Service with ISAF[65]\n\nMeritorious Service Cross from Canada in 2013 [184]\n\nKuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia)\n\nKuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait)\n\n\nBadges\n\nRifle Expert Badge (4th award)\n\nPistol Expert Badge (2nd award)\n\n\nBadge\n\nOffice of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge\n\nMeritorious Service Cross citation[edit]\n\n\"While occupying key leadership positions within the United States Armed Forces and NATO between 2001 and 2012, General Mattis directly and repeatedly contributed to the Canadian Forces\u2019 operational success in Afghanistan.
