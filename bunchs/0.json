Herman, Donie O'Sullivan, Linette Lopez and Keith Olbermann\nOn December 15, 2022, Twitter suspended the accounts of ten journalists who have covered the company and its owner, Elon Musk. They included reporters Keith Olbermann, Steven L. Herman, and Donie O'Sullivan, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[2][3][4][5] The suspensions came after an incident that occurred on December 14, when Musk's 2-year-old son was followed by a stalker while he was traveling in a car, the stalker thought Musk was in the car.[6] Musk said the accounts had violated a policy on doxxing. Posters on behalf of the owners of the accounts were quick to claim that the suspensions were permanent[2][3][5] before Musk clarified account access would be restricted for seven days.[2][3][5] Some of the accounts were restored earlier.[7][8]\nTwitter officials initially offered no explanation for their decision.[2] They later stated it was due to violations of a new rule, created one day before the bans took place. The policy change prohibited accounts from sharing real-time flight information of private jets.[2][3][9] The bans were allegedly in response to the @ElonJet account, which tracks Musk's private jet. The account and other similar accounts were suspended from Twitter on December 14, 2022, but continued operating on Facebook, Mastodon, and other social media platforms.[3][10][11]\nSeveral of the suspended journalists said they had not violated the rule, and while some had included links to @ElonJet in their articles or reported about the account, it was already suspended at the time of media reports.[2][4][5] The Twitter account of Mastodon\u00a0\u2013 a rival social-media platform\u00a0\u2013 was also suspended on December 15 after linking to @ElonJet on a Mastodon server.[5] Users were unable to share Mastodon links in their tweets[3] and they were labeled as \"potentially harmful\" and containing \"malware\".[12][13]\nMusk wrote of the suspensions that \"same doxxing rules apply to 'journalists' as to everyone else\"[2][14] and \"you doxx, you get banned. End of story.\"[15][3][4] Musk ran two informal Twitter polls, asking followers when the accounts should be restored. In both cases, a majority of users said it should happen immediately. On December 16, following those polls, Musk reinstated several of the accounts,[7][8] though others remained suspended and some journalists were told their accounts would not be restored unless they deleted certain posts,[16][8] as outlined in the Twitter enforcement policy.[17]\nThe suspensions drew criticism from various organizations and individuals.[2][15] Some said the actions undermined Musk's repeated claims of supporting free speech on Twitter, while others said Musk had a history of doxxing and harassing people in similar ways, which he was now criticizing.[2][18] The suspensions were condemned by representatives of several countries and organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union.[15][19] EU officials said the actions may have violated the Digital Services Act, which could result in sanctions or even a ban of Twitter in Europe.[4][16] The Government Accountability Project filed a complaint to the United States Congress regarding the suspensions.[20]\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nFurther information: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk\nTwitter\n\n\n@elonmusk\n\n\n\nMy commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk\n\n\n\nNovember 7, 2022[21]\n\n\n\n\nBusiness magnate Elon Musk purchased the social media company Twitter for $44 billion on October 27, 2022, following a lengthy process that began when Musk made the initial purchase offer on April 14, 2022, then later rescinded the deal after it was accepted. The company sued Musk to compel him to honor his offer, and although Musk had intended to fight in court, he reversed course.[22][23] Upon acquiring Twitter, Musk fired several top executives,[24] fired half of the workforce,[22] and proposed changes to the platform, such as removal of spambots and open-sourcing Twitter's algorithms.[23]\nOne of Musk's primary pledges upon acquiring Twitter was promoting free speech. He was previously concerned that Twitter was censoring conservative viewpoints, and said the platform would allow all legal speech.[2][15][14] He has described himself as a \"free speech absolutist\".[15][25] Acting on this conviction, Musk then restored several accounts that were permanently suspended before his purchase, including former U.S. President Donald Trump,[14] whose account @realDonaldTrump had been suspended for tweets that allegedly helped incite the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[26][27]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety\nTwitter\n\n\n@Safety\n\n\n\nWe've updated our Private Information policy to prohibit sharing someone else's live location in most cases. Here's what changed and why. \ud83e\uddf5\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2022[28]\n\n\n\n\nBefore the Twitter account suspensions of December 14 and 15, 2022, Musk shared concerns about the accounts that tracked his jet.[3] Specifically, he criticized the Internet bot account @ElonJet, which used publicly-available flight data to track trips taken by Musk's private plane. The account, which was started by a college student named Jack Sweeney,[4][11][10][29] had more than 500,000 followers as of December 2022.[9][11][29] Sweeney also ran a version of the bot on the social networking platform Instagram.[29] In January 2022, before Musk had purchased Twitter, he privately offered Sweeney $5,000 to delete the account. Sweeney rejected the offer and asked for $50,000, to which Musk did not agree.[11][14][29] After Musk purchased Twitter, Sweeney cited screenshots provided by a Twitter employee, indicating the company limited the reach of the @ElonJet account, though he said those restrictions were later removed.[11][29] In November 2022, Musk publicly stated that he would not ban @ElonJet, despite claiming the account \"is a direct personal safety risk\", because of his \"commitment to free speech\".[15][3][11][29]\n\nAccount suspensions[edit]\nTwitter policy changes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk\nTwitter\n\n\n@elonmusk\n\n\n\nAny account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended, as it is a physical safety violation. This includes posting links to sites with real-time location info.\nPosting locations someone traveled to on a slightly delayed basis isn\u2019t a safety problem, so is ok.\n\n\n\nDecember 15, 2022[30]\n\n\n\n\nOn December 14, 2022, the social media platform created the new rule that was used to ban accounts publishing the real-time location and movement of private jets.[3] Specifically, Twitter's private information and media policy was modified to include a clause prohibiting the sharing of live location data, stating \"we will remove any tweets or accounts that share someone's live location\".[11]  The word \"jet\" does not appear anywhere in the Twitter policy but according to CNN reporter Donie O'Sullivan the rules \"appeared to be designed specifically to justify the removal of the jet-tracking account\".[11]\nTwitter's official @TwitterSafety account issued messages about the policy change, writing that they would remove tweets that posted live location information and suspend accounts dedicated to doing so. They clarified that users were allowed to share their own live location and the \"historical\" location of someone else, but \"not same-day\" information.[10] Musk himself also tweeted about the new policy on December 14.[14][11]\n\nSuspension of flight-tracking accounts[edit]\n@elonjet account suspended on X\nThe same day the new rule was implemented, Twitter suspended the @ElonJet account, as well as the personal account of its creator (@JxckSweeney).[9][11][29] Other similar accounts were also suspended,[9][10] including some that followed the planes of other billionaires such as Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. Some of these had also been operated by Sweeney,[9][10] who defended himself, telling NBC News: \"All I'm doing is taking their data and putting it on Twitter. There's nothing I'm doing wrong, and I didn't mean any harm.\"[9]\nOn December 14, Musk said that a car carrying one of his children had been followed by a \"crazy stalker (thinking it was me), who later blocked car from moving & climbed onto hood\".[2][9][10] In the same tweet, Musk said he would be taking legal action against Sweeney and \"organizations who supported harm to my family\" as a result of the alleged altercation.[10][14] Musk publicly posted video footage of a man who he said was the person that had been involved in this incident. The man in the video was also using his smartphone to record whoever was filming him, and Musk included the man's license plate in the video clip, asking his followers if anyone recognized him.[2] The South Pasadena police were called to the scene, but no report had been filed.[2] They found no link to suggest the ElonJet account had contributed to the confrontation.[31] The department believes the suspect is a member of Musk's security team.[32]\n\nSuspension of journalist accounts[edit]\nOn December 15, 2022, the social networking service Twitter suspended the accounts of several high-profile journalists who routinely reported on the platform and its owner and CEO, Elon Musk. These journalists included:[2][3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\n\nJournalist\n\nTwitter Handle\n\nOrganization\n\n\nMatt Binder\n\n@mattbinder\n\nMashable\n\n\nDrew Harwell\n\n@drewharwell\n\nThe Washington Post\n\n\nSteven L.

Susan Li (@SusanLiTV), a television journalist with Fox Business Network, was suspended on December 16 after posting a link to an aircraft tracking website in an attempt to demonstrate the ease at which Musk's jet could be tracked using public data.[16] The account of Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) was suspended on December 17 for \"prior doxxing action\", but was quickly restored.[33][34]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk\nTwitter\n\n\n@elonmusk\n\n\n\nSame doxxing rules apply to \"journalists\" as to everyone else\n\n\n\nDecember 16, 2022[35]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk\nTwitter\n\n\n@elonmusk\n\n\n\nCriticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not\n\n\n\nDecember 16, 2022[36]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk\nTwitter\n\n\n@elonmusk\n\n\n\nThey posted my exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service\n\n\n\nDecember 16, 2022[37]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk\nTwitter\n\n\n@elonmusk\n\n\n\n7 day suspension for doxxing. Some time away from Twitter is good for the soul ...\n\n\n\nDecember 16, 2022[38]\n\n\n\n\nExplanation from Twitter and Musk[edit]\nMusk publicly responded to the journalist suspensions a few hours after they occurred.[2] He said the accounts were suspended for doxxing,[2][3] specifically in violation of Twitter's new rule banning accounts that track the location and movement of private jets. That new rule was created on December 14, 2022, the day before the journalist accounts were suspended, in response to accounts that provided information about Musk's private jet.[3][9] Musk said the suspended accounts posted his \"exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service\".[2][25][3]\nMusk defended his actions in a series of tweets. In one, he wrote: \"Same doxxing rules apply to 'journalists' as to everyone else\".[2] In another, he wrote: \"Criticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not.\"[3][5] Ella Irwin, Twitter's head of trust and safety, told Reuters that the organization manually reviewed \"any and all accounts\" in violation of the policy, which included posting links to @ElonJet. She said: \"I understand that the focus seems to be mainly on journalist accounts but we applied the policy equally to journalists and non-journalist accounts today.\"[15]\nA few hours after the suspensions, Musk defended the action during a discussion on Twitter Spaces, a social audio feature of the platform, which was hosted by BuzzFeed reporter Katie Notopoulos and had more than 30,000 listeners. Several of the suspended journalists as well as the creator of the @ElonJet account participated, and were able to join due to a bug that allowed suspended accounts to join Twitter Spaces. During the conversation, Musk repeatedly said, \"You doxx, you get suspended. End of story. That's it.\"[15][3][4] Drew Harwell, one of the suspended journalists, was able to dialogue with Musk about the suspensions briefly, however, Musk left the chat a few minutes after joining, and the Twitter Spaces service was abruptly shut down, disconnecting all the users in Notopoulos's space. Musk later said Twitter Spaces was temporarily unavailable due to a \"legacy bug\" and that it \"should be working tomorrow\".[3] The Twitter Spaces feature remained offline for several hours, although several users, including the conversation's host, found themselves suspended from the service once it became available again.[39]\nFollowing the Mastodon account suspension and ban on sending Mastodon links,[12] a new policy was introduced on December 18 that prohibited sharing of links to a variety of social media sites, including Facebook and Instagram, along with Mastodon. The new Twitter policy would have disallowed such links in tweets and on account profiles, and would trigger suspensions of accounts in violation of this rule.[40][41][42] By December 19, Twitter's new linking policy and official mentions about it had been removed,[43][44] and Musk would later mention that banning users for posting Mastodon links was a mistake.[45]\n\nReinstatement of some accounts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk\nTwitter\n\n\n@elonmusk\n\n\n\nUnsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow\n\u2009\n43%\n\n\nTomorrow\n\u2009\n4.5%\n\n\n7 days from now\n\u2009\n14.4%\n\n\nLonger\n\u2009\n38.1%\n\n535,233 votes \u00b7 Final results\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 16, 2022[46]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk\nTwitter\n\n\n@elonmusk\n\n\n\nUnsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow\n\u2009\n58.7%\n\n\nIn 7 days\n\u2009\n41.3%\n\n3,690,639 votes \u00b7 Final results\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 16, 2022[47]\n\n\n\n\nOn December 15, Musk issued a Twitter poll asking when the suspensions should be lifted. Musk had previously made a similar poll where the majority had voted to reinstate Trump's account, with Musk saying, \"The people have spoken... Vox Populi, Vox Dei\".[14] However, Forbes wrote that it is unclear whether these unscientific polls truly inform or influence Musk.[14] Musk's poll had four options, and while a majority voted for 7 days or longer, a plurality (43%) voted for immediate reinstatement. Musk then wrote in a response tweet, \"Sorry too many options. Will redo poll\", and issued a new poll.[14] The second poll asked users whether he should \"unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time\", and provided only two options \"Now\" or \"In 7 days\". The final result was \"Now\",[16][18] with about 59 percent choosing that option.[16][48]\nOn December 17, Musk said he would reinstate most of the suspended accounts,[16][8] writing of the poll results, \"The people have spoken\".[16] However, some accounts were not restored. Linette Lopez, who had previously published investigations into Tesla, Inc., where Musk also worked as CEO, remained suspended on Twitter and had not heard anything from the platform about possible reinstatement.[16][48] Several of the journalists said account restoration appeared to be contingent on the voluntary deletion of specific posts. Drew Harwell was told his account would be restored if he deleted tweets on the suspension of Mastodon's account.[16][8] Steven L. Herman said his account is now visible to others, but he cannot use it because he won't delete three tweets that Twitter claimed were sharing Musk's location. Herman said: \"I am in a new level of purgatory. I do not believe anything I have tweeted violate any reasonable standard of any social media platform.\"[48] Micah Lee also said that, while his account was technically reinstated, he was still locked out unless he agreed to delete some of his past tweets. Lee called the claim that his suspension was lifted \"an illusion\".[49]\n\nResponses[edit]\nSuspended journalists[edit]\nThe journalists were not initially told if their accounts had been permanently or temporarily suspended, and were not informed why they had been blocked or what specific rule was violated.[2][25][4] Immediately after the suspension, Rupar said he was given no information about why the action occurred,[2][4] saying he hadn't \"been given a reason, explanation, or been looped in about any possible duration.\"[2] Rupar added that he \"didn't post anything remotely controversial today or anytime recently\".[2] Micah Lee also said he was not given a reason for the suspension, but said it came shortly after he posted on Twitter about Mastodon's account suspension.[25] Lee also wrote: \"While my reporting may not have provided the direct impetus for my suspension, it's clear Musk was taking aim specifically at journalists who have covered him critically.\"[25] Olbermann's suspension occurred shortly after he had criticized the suspension of other journalists.[2] Rupar's suspension came one day after he had shared a Substack article by Noah Berlatsky that was critical of Musk, entitled \"Elon Musk's reactionary populism\".[5][50] After Musk's explanation about the suspensions, Aaron Rupar said he had not posted anything that violated the policy about disclosing locations, and had never posted anything about @ElonJet prior to his suspension, adding: \"Unless the policy is that you criticize Elon and you get suspended.\"[5]\nSome of the suspended journalists had written stories about Musk suspending @ElonJet,[4] though others had not. Matt Binder said he did not share any location data or links to jet-tracking accounts, and was suspended immediately after sharing a screenshot that Donie O'Sullivan posted before his own suspension. Binder said, \"I have been highly critical of Musk but never broke any of Twitter's listed policies.\"[48] Linette Lopez said of her suspension: \"Its funny that Elon suddenly has a problem with doxxing and harassing people because he [also] has a history of doing that ...\"[18] Drew Harwell said he did not share information about Musk's private jet or personal location, but simply posted a link to the @ElonJet account in his stories.[15][4] In a direct conversation with Musk on Twitter Spaces, Harwell said: \"We have to acknowledge you are using the same exact link-blocking technique that you have criticized as part of the Hunter Biden\u2013New York Post story in 2020.\"[25][4] In an interview with CNN, Harwell stated: \"Elon says he is a free speech champion and he is banning journalists for exercising free speech. I think that calls into question his commitment.\"[5]\n\nOther commentators[edit]\nNew York Times external communications director Charlie Stadtlander said that the suspensions were \"questionable and unfortunate\", and that neither their organization nor Times journalist Ryan Mac were provided an adequate explanation for the decision to suspend the accounts.[1] Washington Post Executive Editor Sally Buzbee said the suspensions occurred \"without warning, process, or explanation\" and that they \"directly undermined Elon Musk's claim that he intends to run Twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech\".[51] CNN stated that Musk's actions were \"impulsive and unjustified\" but \"not surprising\", and that it would reevaluate its relationship with Twitter. The CNN statement also said: \"Twitter's increasing instability and volatility should be of incredible concern for everyone who uses Twitter.\"[48] Oliver Darcy, a CNN reporter, wrote that Musk's allegations of doxxing were \"not what those journalists did\".[2] Cybersecurity writer Brian Krebs said Twitter's claim that Mastodon links might have malware was a \"bald-faced lie\".[48] Lou Paskalis, a media executive, said the suspensions could create uncertainty among news organizations and advertisers. Paskalis said the bans were \"the biggest self-inflicted wound I can think of\".[48]\nCommentators have been critical of the suspensions, including media outlets and international representatives,[2][15] officials from several countries, the United Nations and European Union.[15] Many critics said the actions undermined Musk's claims of supporting free speech.[2] The suspensions were labeled by Alex Stamos, a security researcher, and Micah Lee from The Intercept, as the \"Thursday Night Massacre\".[25][7][4][15]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez\nTwitter\n\n\n@AOC\n\n\n\n             You're a public figure.

David Seide, senior counsel with the organization, called the actions \"disturbing\" and urged Congress to \"review this mistreatment\" and investigate further.[20] Brendan Carr, an FCC commissioner, said that \"one person should not get to decide who participates in the digital town square\".[4]\n\nSee also[edit]\nTwitter suspensions\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Isaac, Mike; Conger, Mike (December 15, 2022). \"Twitter Suspends Accounts of Half a Dozen Journalists\".

Twitter's moderation is seemingly guided less by set rules and more by what its owner wants at any moment. While Musk argues he's protecting people from being doxed, this week he censored accounts freely\u2014not for illegal speech, but because they offended him.  This new approach will have a lasting impact on Twitter. Journalists have helped keep the platform relevant despite its small size relative to competitors like Facebook: They fuel the platform with free, vetted content when news breaks and speculation and rumors swirl.

    "wiki": "Aaron Withe is the Chief Executive Officer of the Freedom Foundation. Aaron began his career at the Freedom Foundation in 2015, working in the outreach department. He devised a full-scale outreach campaign that included having a team of door-to-door canvassers contact all union members throughout Oregon and inform them of their rights to leave their union.  After various promotions the Freedom Foundation\u2019s Board of Directors appointed Aaron as the CEO in 2021.  As an immigrant-turned-U.S. citizen, Aaron recognizes America as the freest and most prosperous country in the world. However, he also recognizes the very real threat posed by the government unions attacking the foundations of the American dream. This is what fuels Aaron as he now leads the Freedom Foundation\u2019s national campaign to free every public employee in America from union bondage.  Aaron is the author of the book Freedom is the Foundation: How we are defeating progressive tyranny by taking on the government unions.  Aaron has been a featured speaker for the Freedom Foundation at a multitude of events, including the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) 2019. He was the proud recipient of the Oregon Taxpayer Association\u2019s 2019 Thomas Jefferson Award. He was formerly on the Washington & Oregon Advisory Committees to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. And he is a member of the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s (AEI) Leadership Network.  Aaron has often shared the Freedom Foundation\u2019s message on TV, including appearances on Fox News, Fox Business, One America News, Newsmax, and The Huckabee Show on TBN. He has been featured on several national and local radio shows, including Sean Hannity and Lars Larson, and in print media outlets across the country, including the Wall Street Journal, the Hill, and the Daily Wire.  He is a native of Birmingham, England, and is a graduate and former basketball player at Corban University in Oregon. In his spare time, he enjoys spending time with his wife Aubree and their daughter Amelia, as well as with their extended family and friends. He is active in his church and enjoys relaxing at several Pacific North West\u2019s",

He was named a spring 2019 Shorenstein Center fellow, and received the 2019 Hillman Prize for Opinion & Analysis Journalism.[2][3][4][5][6][7]\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\nSerwer was raised in Washington, D.C.[8] His father, Daniel Serwer, was in the Foreign Service, which resulted in Serwer spending part of his childhood overseas. His mother, Jacquelyn Serwer, is the chief curator of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture.[9] His father is European and Jewish and his mother is African-American.[10] He has a brother named Jared Serwer.\nSerwer received his bachelor's degree from Vassar College and his master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.[11] Following graduate school, he was a writing fellow at The American Prospect.[12] He later worked at Mother Jones,[13] MSNBC, The Washington Post, Jack and Jill Politics, Salon, and The Atlantic as a guest blogger for Ta-Nehisi Coates.[14][15][16] He began work at BuzzFeed News as the national editor in August 2014.[4][5] Serwer was hired as a senior editor at The Atlantic on August 15, 2016.[17] His work there has focused on white supremacy, race in America, and the Trump administration.[18] Essays such as \"The Nationalist's Delusion\", \"White Nationalism's Deep American Roots\", and \"The Cruelty Is the Point\" have been cited by other journalists in various outlets.[19][20][21][22][23][24][25] He has also appeared on other media outlets such as All Things Considered, The Opposition with Jordan Klepper, In the Thick, and On My Mind with Diane Rehm to discuss his writing.[26][27][28] In his best known essay, \"The Cruelty Is the Point\", published in 2018,[29] Serwer argued that the Trump administration\u2019s policies were not only cruel, but cruel by design.\nSerwer received a fellowship from the Shorenstein Center in 2019, for which he researched the historical role of African Americans and voting.[30] He received the 2019 Hillman Prize for his work on the rise of Trump, Trumpism and America's history of racism.[31]\nHis first book, The Cruelty Is the Point: The Past, Present, and Future of Trump's America, is a collection of essays that was released June 29, 2021 by One World/Penguin Random House.[32][33] The book was named to the New York Times Best Seller list. Kirkus reviewed it as \"a strong contribution to conversations about racism, injustice, and violence, all of which continue to plague this country.\"[34] Conservative writer Helen Andrews criticized the book in The American Conservative as \"the most toxic piece of journalism of the Trump era.\"[35]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nSerwer is married.[36] He and his wife have one daughter (b. 2019). He practices Judaism.[37]\nHe has multiple cats whom he frequently tweets about and refers to as \"the Garfields\" because they are all orange.

J. Simpson, part of the legal \"Dream Team\", alongside Johnnie Cochran and F. Lee Bailey.[9] He was a member of Harvey Weinstein's defense team in 2018[6] and of President Donald Trump's defense team in his first impeachment trial in 2020.[5] He was a member of Jeffrey Epstein's defense team and helped to negotiate a 2006 non-prosecution agreement on Epstein's behalf.[10]\nDershowitz is the author of several books about politics and the law, including Reversal of Fortune: Inside the von B\u00fclow Case (1985), the basis of the 1990 film; Chutzpah (1991); Reasonable Doubts: The Criminal Justice System and the O. J. Simpson Case (1996); The Case for Israel (2003); and The Case for Peace (2005). His two most recent works are The Case Against Impeaching Trump (2018) and Guilt by Accusation: The Challenge of Proving Innocence in the Age of #MeToo (2019).[11][12] An ardent Zionist and supporter of Israel,[13] he has written several books on the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nDershowitz was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on September 1, 1938, the son of Claire (n\u00e9e Ringel) and Harry Dershowitz,[14] an Orthodox Jewish couple.[8] He was raised in Borough Park.[15] His father was a founder and president of the Young Israel of Boro Park Synagogue in the 1960s, served on the board of directors of the Etz Chaim School in Borough Park, and in retirement was co-owner of the Manhattan-based Merit Sales Company.[16][17] Dershowitz's first job was at a deli factory on Manhattan's Lower East Side in 1952, at age 14.[18]\nDershowitz attended Yeshiva University High School, an independent boys' prep school in Manhattan owned by Yeshiva University, where he played on the basketball team. He was a rebellious student, often criticized by his teachers. He later said his teachers told him to do something that \"requires a big mouth and no brain ... so I became a lawyer\".[19] After graduating from high school, he studied political science at Brooklyn College, graduating in 1959 with a Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude. He then attended Yale Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal.[15] He graduated in 1962 ranked first in his class with a Bachelor of Laws.[3] He was a member of a Conservative minyan at Harvard Hillel but is a secular Jew.[20]\n\nLegal and teaching career\nAfter law school, Dershowitz clerked for Judge David L. Bazelon (pictured), whom he has described as one of his most influential mentors.\nAfter graduating from law school, Dershowitz was a law clerk for chief judge David L. Bazelon of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1962 to 1963.[8] Dershowitz described Bazelon as an influential mentor. He has said, \"Bazelon was my best and worst boss at once.... He worked me to the bone; he didn't hesitate to call at 2 a.m. He taught me everything\u2014how to be a civil libertarian, a Jewish activist, a mensch. He was halfway between a slave master and a father figure.\" From 1963 to 1964 Dershowitz clerked for the Justice Arthur Goldberg of the U.S. Supreme Court.[8]\nHe told Tom Van Riper of Forbes that getting a Supreme Court clerkship was probably his second big break. His first was at age 14 or 15, when a camp counselor told him he was smart but that his mind operated a little differently.[18] He joined the Harvard Law School faculty as an assistant professor in 1964, and was made a full professor in 1967 at age 28, at that time the youngest full professor of law in the school's history.[21] He was appointed as the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law in 1993.[3] Dershowitz retired from teaching at Harvard Law in 2013.[4] He is a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Gatestone Institute.[22][23][24]\nThroughout his tenure at Harvard, Dershowitz maintained his legal practice in both criminal and civil law. His clients have included such high-profile figures as Patty Hearst, Harry Reems, Leona Helmsley, Jim Bakker, Mike Tyson, Michael Milken, O. J. Simpson and Kirtanananda Swami. Dershowitz reportedly was one of Nelson Mandela's lawyers.[25][26]\n\nNotable clients\nHarry Reems (1976)\nIn 1976, Dershowitz handled the successful appeal of Harry Reems, who had been convicted of distribution of obscenity resulting from acting in the pornographic movie Deep Throat.[6] Dershowitz argued against censorship of pornography on First Amendment grounds and maintained that consumption of pornography was not harmful.[27][28]\n\nClaus von B\u00fclow (1984)\nFurther information: Reversal of Fortune\nIn one of his first high-profile cases, Dershowitz represented Claus von B\u00fclow, a British socialite, at his appeal for the attempted murder of his wife, Sunny von B\u00fclow, who went into a coma in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1980 (and later died in 2008).[29] He succeeded in having the conviction overturned, and von B\u00fclow was acquitted in a retrial.[30] Dershowitz told the story of the case in his book Reversal of Fortune: Inside the von B\u00fclow case (1985),[31] which was adapted into a movie in 1990. Dershowitz was played by actor Ron Silver, and Dershowitz himself had a cameo as a judge.[32]\nIn his book Taking the Stand, Dershowitz recounts that von B\u00fclow had a dinner party after he was found not guilty at his retrial. Dershowitz told him that he would not attend if it was a \"victory party,\" and von B\u00fclow assured him that it was only a dinner for \"several interesting friends.\" Norman Mailer attended the dinner where, among other things, Dershowitz explained why the evidence pointed to von B\u00fclow's innocence. Dershowitz described Mailer grabbing his wife's arm and saying: \"Let's get out of here. I think this guy is innocent. I thought we were going to be having dinner with a man who actually tried to kill his wife. This is boring.\"[33]\n\nAvi Weiss (1989)\nIn 1989, Dershowitz filed a defamation suit against Cardinal J\u00f3zef Glemp, then Archbishop of Warsaw, on behalf of Rabbi Avi Weiss. That summer, Weiss and six other members of the Jewish community in New York had staged a protest at the Auschwitz concentration camp over the presence of a controversial convent of Carmelite nuns.[34] Weiss and the protesters were ejected after attempting to scale a wall surrounding the convent.[34] In an August 1989 speech, Glemp referenced the incident and ascribed a violent intent to the protesters, saying, \"Recently, a squad of seven Jews from New York launched an attack on the convent at Oswiecim [Auschwitz]. They did not kill the nuns or destroy the convent only because they were stopped.\" In the same speech, Glemp made antisemitic remarks suggesting that Jews control the news media.[34] Dershowitz's suit centered on these statements.[34] His account of the lawsuit appears in his 1991 book Chutzpah.[35][36]\n\nO. J. Simpson (1995)\nMain article: Murder trial of O. J. Simpson\nDuring the murder trial of O. J. Simpson, Dershowitz acted as an appellate adviser to Simpson's defense team,[9] and later wrote a book about it, Reasonable Doubts: The Criminal Justice System and the O. J. Simpson Case (1996). Dershowitz wrote: \"the Simpson case will not be remembered in the next century. It will not rank as one of the trials of the century. It will not rank with the Nuremberg trials, the Rosenberg trial, Sacco and Vanzetti. It is on par with Leopold and Loeb and the Lindbergh case, all involving celebrities. It is also not one of the most important cases of my own career. I would rank it somewhere in the middle in terms of interest and importance.\"[37] The case has been described as the most publicized criminal trial in American history.[38]\n\nJeffrey Epstein (2008)\nDershowitz was a member of the legal defense team for the first criminal case against Jeffrey Epstein, who was investigated after accusations that he had repeatedly solicited sex from minors.[39] Dershowitz had previously befriended Epstein through their mutual acquaintance Lynn Forester de Rothschild.[10]\nThe first investigation into Epstein concluded with a controversial non-prosecution agreement that Dershowitz helped negotiate on Epstein's behalf.[10] On June 30, 2008, after Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge (one of two) of procuring for prostitution a girl below age 18, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison.[40]\n\nJulian Assange (2011)\nIn 2011, Dershowitz served as a consultant for Julian Assange's legal team while Assange was facing the prospect of charges from the U.S. government for distributing classified documents through WikiLeaks.[41] Of his decision to engage with Assange's team, Dershowitz said that Assange should be considered a journalist, adding, \"I believe that to protect the First Amendment we need to protect new electronic media vigorously.\"[42]\n\nHarvey Weinstein (2018)\nMain article: Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases\nIn May 2018, Dershowitz joined Harvey Weinstein's legal team as a consultant for Weinstein's lawyer Benjamin Brafman. Dershowitz advised the team on obtaining documents from The Weinstein Company related to the sexual abuse allegations against Weinstein.[43]\n\nDonald Trump (2020)\nMain article: First impeachment of Donald Trump\nDershowitz arguing on the Senate floor during the impeachment of Donald Trump\nIn January 2020, Dershowitz joined President Donald Trump's legal team as Trump was being tried on impeachment charges in the Senate.[44] Dershowitz's addition to the team was notable, as commentators pointed out that he was a Hillary Clinton supporter and had offered occasionally controversial television defenses of Trump in the preceding two years.[45] The statement announcing Dershowitz's joining the team said that Dershowitz was \"nonpartisan when it comes to the Constitution.\"[44] Dershowitz said he would not accept any compensation, and if he was paid anything, he would donate it to charity.[39][46] He defended his representation of Trump, which was controversial among Trump critics, saying, \"I'm there to try to defend the integrity of the constitution. That benefits President Trump in this case.\"[46] Dershowitz said that his role would be limited to presenting oral arguments before the Senate opposing impeachment.[47]\nIn his oral arguments, Dershowitz said that proof of a crime is required to impeach a president. Some commentators suggested that his position contradicted his statements during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, when he said no proof of a crime was required.[48] Dershowitz later retracted his statements made during the Clinton era, saying, \"To the extent there are inconsistencies between my current position and what I said 22 years ago, I am correct today\u00a0.... During the Clinton impeachment, the issue was not whether a technical crime was required, because he was charged with perjury.\"[49]\nSome of his comments were considered to represent an overly expansive view of executive power. He argued, \"If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\" Dershowitz later said his comment was mischaracterized: \"a president seeking reelection cannot do anything he wants. He is not above the law. He cannot commit crimes.\"[50][51]\nAfter the trial, Dershowitz used his ties with the Trump administration to lobby it to give clemency to various Dershowitz clients. He played a role in at least 12 clemency grants, as well as unsuccessfully lobbying the administration to commute the 10-year sentence of George Nader, who had pleaded guilty to child pornography and sex trafficking.[52]\n\nPolitical views, writings, and commentary\nPolitics\nDershowitz is a member of the Democratic Party. In 2016, he said that if Keith Ellison were appointed party chair, he would leave the party;[53] Tom Perez was appointed instead. Dershowitz endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 presidential election, and later endorsed the nominee, Barack Obama.[54] He opposed the impeachment of Bill Clinton and said that he voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.[55] Dershowitz campaigned against Trump during the 2016 election and has been critical of many of his actions, including his travel ban, his rescission of protections for \"Dreamers\", and his failure to single out white nationalists for their provocations during protests in Charlottesville.[56][57] Comparing Trump unfavorably to Hillary Clinton in October 2016, Dershowitz said, \"I think there's no comparison between who has engaged in more corruption and who is more likely to continue that if elected President of the United States.\"[58]Dershowitz taught at Harvard Law School for nearly five decades, where he became the youngest tenured professor in the school's history.\nIsrael and the Middle East\nDershowitz is a strong supporter of Israel.[6][8][13] He self-identifies as both \"pro-Israel and pro-Palestine,\" writing, \"I want to see a vibrant, democratic, economically viable, peaceful Palestinian state existing side by side with Israel.\"[59] He has said, \"were I an Israeli, I'd be a person of the left and voting the left\".[60] He also criticized President Obama's foreign policy stance toward Israel after the U.S. abstained from voting on United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israel for building Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory.[61] He has said, \"I will not be a member of a party that represents itself through a chairman like Keith Ellison and through policies like that espoused by John Kerry and Barack Obama.\"[62]\nDershowitz had a contract to provide advice to Joey Allaham, a lobbyist working for the Qatari government. In January 2018, Dershowitz questioned claims that Qatar funds terrorist groups, including Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including Israel, the U.S., and the European Union.[63] Dershowitz wrote, \"Qatar is quickly becoming the Israel of the Gulf States, surrounded by enemies, subject to boycotts and unrealistic demands, and struggling for its survival.\"[64]\nDershowitz has engaged in public debates with several other commentators, including Meir Kahane,[65] Noam Chomsky, and Norman Finkelstein. When former U.S. President Jimmy Carter published his book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid (2006) \u2013 in which he argues that Israel's control of Palestinian land is the primary obstacle to peace \u2013 Dershowitz challenged Carter to a debate at Brandeis University. Carter declined, saying, \"I don't want to have a conversation even indirectly with Dershowitz. There is no need to debate somebody who, in my opinion, knows nothing about the situation in Palestine.\"[66] Carter did address Brandeis in January 2007, but only Brandeis students and staff were allowed to attend. Dershowitz was invited to respond on the same stage only after Carter had left.[67][68] He authored an editorial in the Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post accusing Alice Walker of bigotry for refusing to have her novel The Color Purple published by an Israeli firm.[69]\nIn April 2009, Dershowitz took part in the Doha Debates at Georgetown University, where he spoke against the motion \"this House believes it's time for the US to get tough on Israel\" with Dore Gold, President of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. Speakers for the motion were Avraham Burg, former chair of the Jewish Agency for Israel and former Speaker of the Knesset; and Michael Scheuer, former chief of the CIA Bin Laden Issue Station. Dershowitz's side lost the debate, with 63% of the audience voting for the motion.[70]\nIn 2006, Dershowitz argued for the prosecution of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad for incitement to genocide based on his threat of \"wiping Israel off the map\".[71][72] His 2015 book The Case Against the Iran Deal argues that the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, had urged the Iranian military \"to have two nuclear bombs ready to go off in January 2005 or you're not Muslims\".[73] On February 29, 2012, Dershowitz filed an amicus brief in support of delisting the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) from the State Department list of foreign terrorist organizations.[74][75]\nOf civilian casualties, Dershowitz has said, \"In the age of terrorism, when militants don't wear uniforms, don't belong to regular armies, and easily blend into civilian populations,\" civilian casualties should be reexamined in terms of a \"continuum of civilianality.\" In one example, he writes: \"There is a vast difference \u2013 both moral and legal \u2013 between a 2-year-old who is killed by an enemy rocket and a 30-year-old civilian who has allowed his house to be used to store Katyusha rockets.\"[76]\n\nHarvard-MIT divestment petition\nDershowitz in 2018\nRandall Adams of The Harvard Crimson wrote that, in the spring of 2002, a petition calling for Harvard and MIT to divest from Israeli and American companies that sell arms to Israel gathered over 600 signatures, including 74 from Harvard faculty and 56 from MIT faculty. Among the signatories was Harvard's Winthrop House Master Paul D. Hanson, in response to which Dershowitz staged a debate for 200 students in the Winthrop Junior Common Room. He called the petition's signatories antisemitic bigots and said they knew nothing about the Middle East. \"Your House master is a bigot\", he told the students, \"and you ought to know that.\" Adams wrote that Dershowitz cited examples of human rights violations in countries that the U.S. supports, such as the execution of homosexuals in Egypt and the repression of women in Saudi Arabia, and said he would sue any professor who voted against the tenure of another academic because of the candidate's position on Israel, calling them \"ignoramuses with PhDs\".[77]\n\nNew response to Palestinian terrorism (2002) suggestion\nIn March 2002, Dershowitz published an article in The Jerusalem Post titled \"New Response to Palestinian Terrorism\". In it, he wrote that Israel should announce a unilateral cessation in retaliation, at the end of which it would \"announce precisely what it will do in response to the next act of terrorism. For example, it could announce the first act of terrorism following the moratorium will result in the destruction of a small village which has been used as a base for terrorist operations. The residents would be given 24 hours to leave, and then, troops will come in and bulldoze all of the buildings.\" The list of targets would be made public in advance.[78] The proposal attracted criticism from within Harvard University and beyond.[79] James Bamford argued in The Washington Post that it would violate international law.[80] Norman Finkelstein wrote, \"it is hard to make out any difference between the policy Dershowitz advocates and the Nazi destruction of Lidice, for which he expresses abhorrence \u2013 except that Jews, not Germans, would be implementing it\".[81]\n\n2006 Israel\u2013Lebanon conflict\nIn July 2006, Dershowitz wrote a series of articles defending the Israel Defense Forces' conduct during the 2006 Israel\u2013Lebanon conflict. There was an international outcry at the time over escalating Lebanese civilian deaths and the destruction of civilian infrastructure resulting from Israel's stated attempt to weaken or destroy Hezbollah. After UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour indicated that Israeli officials might be investigated and indicted for war crimes, Dershowitz called her statement \"bizarre\", called for her dismissal, and wrote about what he called the \"absurdity and counterproductive nature of current international law\".[82] In an op-ed several days later in The Boston Globe, he argued that Israel was not to blame for civilian deaths: \"Israel has every self-interest in minimizing civilian casualties, whereas the terrorists have every self-interest in maximizing them \u2013 on both sides. Israel should not be condemned for doing what every democracy would and should do: taking every reasonable military step to stop the killing of their own civilians.\"[83]\n\n2nd Amendment and gun control\nDershowitz is a strong supporter of gun control. He has criticized the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, saying that it has \"no place in modern society\".[84] Dershowitz supports repealing the amendment, but vigorously opposes using the judicial system to read it out of the Constitution because that would open the way for further revisions to the Bill of Rights and Constitution by the courts. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a public safety hazard don't see the danger in the big picture. They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\"[85]\n\nTakings Clause, 5th and 14th Amendments (business law)\nDershowitz took on a case of a 1% shareholder of the TransPerfect company and argued that the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment and Due Process under both the 5th and 14th Amendments apply to individuals even in a corporate issue.[86][87] He is an attorney for defendant Shirley Shawe and is looking to take the case of the Delaware Chancery's forced sale of TransPerfect away from its shareholders to the Supreme Court.[88] Dershowitz has argued that the Delaware Chancery court violated the personal rights of an individual shareholder when it ordered the public auction on the company.[89]\n\nTorture\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Dershowitz published an article in the San Francisco Chronicle titled \"Want to Torture? Get a Warrant\", in which he advocated the issuance of warrants permitting the torture of terrorism suspects if there were an \"absolute need to obtain immediate information in order to save lives coupled with probable cause that the suspect had such information and is unwilling to reveal it\".[90] He argued that authorities should be permitted to use non-lethal torture in a ticking time bomb scenario and that it would be less destructive to the rule of law to regulate the process than to leave it to individual law-enforcement agents' discretion. He favors preventing the government from prosecuting the subject of torture based on information revealed during such an interrogation.[91] A play based on the scenario by Robert Fothergill was named after Dershowitz.[92]\nWilliam F. Schulz, executive director of the U.S. section of Amnesty International, found Dershowitz's ticking-bomb scenario unrealistic because, he argued, it would require that \"the authorities know that a bomb has been planted somewhere; know it is about to go off; know that the suspect in their custody has the information they need to stop it; know that the suspect will yield that information accurately in a matter of minutes if subjected to torture; and know that there is no other way to obtain it\".[93] James Bamford of The Washington Post described one of the practices mentioned by Dershowitz \u2013 the \"sterilized needle being shoved under the fingernails\" \u2013 as \"chillingly Nazi-like\".[80]\n\nAnimal rights\nDershowitz is one of several scholars at Harvard Law School who have expressed their support for limited animal rights.[94] In his Rights from Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights (2004), he writes that, in order to prevent human beings from treating each other the way we treat animals, we have made what he calls the \"somewhat arbitrary decision\" to single out our own species for different and better treatment. \"Does this subject us to the charge of speciesism? Of course it does, and we cannot justify it, except by the fact that in the world in which we live, humans make the rules. That reality imposes on us a special responsibility to be fair and compassionate to those on whom we impose our rules. Hence the argument for animal rights.\"[95]\n\nCriticism of the American Civil Liberties Union\nIn June 2018, Dershowitz wrote an op-ed criticizing the American Civil Liberties Union, alleging that it had become a hyper-partisan organization and was no longer the nonpartisan group of politically diverse individuals sharing a commitment to core civil liberties it once was. He wrote, \"The move of the ACLU to the hard-left reflects an even more dangerous and more general trend in the United States: the right is moving further right; the left is moving farther left, and the center is shrinking... The ACLU's move from the neutral protector of civil liberties to a partisan advocate of hard-left politics is both a symptom and consequence of this change.\" He also criticized Trump, writing that by denying fundamental civil liberties, he was also to blame for pushing the ACLU further into partisan politics.[96]Dershowitz with Representative Gary Ackerman and Larry David in October 2004\nPresidential candidates\nDuring the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, Dershowitz endorsed Hillary Clinton, calling her \"a progressive on social issues, a realist on foreign policy, a pragmatist on the economy\".[97] In 2012, he strongly supported Barack Obama's reelection, writing, \"President Obama has earned my vote on the basis of his excellent judicial appointments, his consensus-building foreign policy, and the improvements he has brought about in the disastrous economy he inherited.\"[98] In 2018, after a photo with Obama and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan at a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus emerged, Dershowitz said he would never have campaigned for Obama had the photo been publicized soon after it was taken.[99]\nIn the 2020 Democratic Party primaries, Dershowitz endorsed Joe Biden. He said: \"I'm a strong supporter of Joe Biden. I like Joe Biden. I've liked him for a long time, and I could enthusiastically support Joe Biden.\" He criticized Bernie Sanders, saying: \"I don't think under any circumstances I could vote for a man who went to England and campaigned for a bigot and anti-Semite like Jeremy Corbyn.\"[100]\n\nDonald Trump\nDershowitz has offered commentary on Trump's legal issues that has been polarizing among liberals and Democrats, as he has often been perceived as offering defenses of Trump's more controversial actions.[101] Dershowitz has maintained that his weighing in is apolitical, saying, \"I am a liberal Democrat in politics, but a neutral civil libertarian when it comes to the Constitution.\"[102]\nIn January 2018, Dershowitz said that attacking Trump's mental fitness was a \"very dangerous\" line of attack[103] and that there was \"no case\" that Trump committed obstruction of justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey.[104] He called the indictment of Michael Flynn the strangest he had ever seen because Flynn lied about something that was not illegal, and claimed that \"collusion\" in reference to Russian meddling in the 2016 election is not a crime.[105] But Dershowitz said that Trump's alleged disclosure of classified information to Russia is \"the most serious charge ever made against a sitting president\".[56][57] His 2018 book The Case Against Impeaching Trump argues against impeachment.[106]\nDershowitz has received some criticism from liberals and praise from conservatives for his comments on these issues.[107][108] He defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against accusations by Julie Swetnick that Kavanaugh and Mark Judge were at a party where she was gang-raped. Dershowitz said on Fox News, \"that affidavit is so deeply flawed and so open-ended that any good lawyer, any good defense attorney would be able to tear that apart in 30 seconds\".[109] Dershowitz called on Swetnick's lawyer Michael Avenatti, who was also representing Stormy Daniels, to withdraw the affidavit because of inconsistencies.[110][111]\nDershowitz and others recommended that Trump commute Sholom Rubashkin's sentence for bank fraud in the Agriprocessors case.[112]\nIn 2019, Dershowitz said he would \"enthusiastically support Joe Biden\" for president.[113]\nIn 2021, Dershowitz said that Trump's rally preceding the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol was \"constitutionally protected\" speech. He said it would be his \"honor and privilege\" to defend Trump in a trial.[114] Trump reportedly considered him for his defense team.[115]\n\nAcademic and other disputes\nNorman Finkelstein\nFurther information: Dershowitz\u2013Finkelstein affair\nShortly after the publication of Dershowitz's The Case for Israel (2003), Norman Finkelstein of DePaul University said the book contained material plagiarized from Joan Peters's book From Time Immemorial.[116][117][8] Dershowitz denied the allegation. Harvard's president, Derek Bok, investigated the allegation and determined that no plagiarism had occurred.[118][119] Los Angeles attorney Frank Menetrez wrote an article analyzing the dispute's details that supported Finkelstein's charges, concluding: \"I don't see how Dershowitz could, purely by coincidence, have precisely reproduced all of Peters' errors [in quoting The Innocents Abroad] if he was working from the original Twain.\" CounterPunch published Dershowitz's response and Menetrez's reply. Dershowitz dismissed the charges as verifiably false and politically motivated by hostility to his support for Israel, and Menetrez reaffirmed his view that the evidence pointed to Dershowitz having plagiarized his sources.[120][121][122]\nIn October 2006, Dershowitz wrote to DePaul University faculty members to lobby against Finkelstein's application for tenure, accusing Finkelstein of academic dishonesty.[123] The university's Liberal Arts and Sciences faculty voted to send a letter of complaint to Harvard University.[124][8] In June 2007, DePaul University denied Finkelstein tenure.[125]\n\nMearsheimer and Walt\nFurther information: The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy\nIn March 2006, John Mearsheimer, professor of political science at the University of Chicago, and Stephen Walt, professor of international affairs at Harvard Kennedy School, co-wrote a paper titled \"The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy\", published in The London Review of Books.[126] Mearsheimer and Walt criticized what they called \"the Israel lobby\" for influencing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East in a direction away from U.S. interests and toward Israel's. They referred to Dershowitz specifically as an \"apologist\" for the Israel lobby. In a March 2006 interview with The Harvard Crimson, Dershowitz called the article \"one-sided\" and its authors \"liars\" and \"bigots\".[127] The next day, on MSNBC's Scarborough Country, he suggested the paper had been derived from multiple hate sites: \"Every paragraph virtually is copied from a neo-Nazi Web site, from a radical Islamic Web site, from David Duke's Web site.\"[128] Dershowitz subsequently wrote a report challenging the paper, arguing that it contained \"three types of major errors: Quotations are wrenched out of context, important facts are misstated or omitted, and embarrassingly weak logic is employed.\"[129] In a letter in the London Review of Books in May 2006, Mearsheimer and Walt denied that they had used any racist sources for their article, writing that Dershowitz had failed to offer any evidence to support his claim.[130]\n\nDefamation lawsuits\nBeginning in 2015, Dershowitz was involved in a series of defamation lawsuits and countersuits over allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct. The suits were settled in 2022 with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, saying, \"I now recognize I may have made a mistake in identifying Mr. Dershowitz\".[131] In a December 30, 2014, Florida court filing, Giuffre alleged she was sexually trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, who lent her to people for sex, including Dershowitz and Prince Andrew.[8][132][133] The motion claimed that Dershowitz was also an eyewitness to the sexual abuse of other minors.[134][135] Giuffre's affidavit was included in a 2008 lawsuit filed on behalf of women who say they were sexually abused by Epstein; the lawsuit accused the Justice Department of violating the Crime Victims Rights Act by entering into a plea agreement with Epstein that allowed him to serve jail time on state charges but avoid federal prosecution.[136][137]\nIn the week after the release of Giuffre's affidavit, Dershowitz denied the allegations and sought disbarment of the lawyers filing the suit.[138][139][136] That same week of January 2015, Giuffre's lawyers, Bradley Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, sued Dershowitz for defamation.[132][140] By early April 2015, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra had the allegations against Dershowitz and Andrew removed from the record as having no bearing on the 2008 lawsuit seeking to reopen Epstein's case.[141] Dershowitz countersued Edwards and Cassell in 2015,[10] and the two parties settled for an undisclosed sum by April 2016.[142]\nIn February 2019, Marra ruled that prosecutors had violated the Crime Victims Rights Act.[143] In April 2019, Giuffre filed a defamation lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Dershowitz, alleging he had made \"false and malicious defamatory statements\" about her, such as accusing her of perjury. The lawsuit sought punitive damages and included the previous claims that Epstein sex-trafficked Giuffre to Dershowitz.[144] Dershowitz said that he would \"prove without any doubt that she is lying about me. She is going to end up in prison.\"[145]\nIn June 2019, Dershowitz filed a motion to dismiss Giuffre's suit (which was later denied)[12] and a motion to disqualify David Boies's firm from representing her (which was later approved).[10][146] In November 2019, Dershowitz filed a countersuit against Giuffre and accused Boies of pressuring Giuffre to provide false testimony, in response to which Boies sued Dershowitz in November 2019 for defamation.[147] In the November 2019 lawsuit, Dershowitz alleged that Giuffre had \"falsely and with a knowing and reckless disregard of falsity and acting out of ill-will and spite publicly labelled Dershowitz as a child rapist and molester.\"[148] In a July 31, 2020 interview, Dershowitz said, \"I never met her. I never saw her.\"[149]\nGiuffre repeated her allegations on camera as part of the May 2020 Netflix series Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich, and stated that Epstein had trafficked her to Dershowitz for sex at least six times.[150][151] In response, Dershowitz repeated his denial of Giuffre's account and accused her of selling false allegations to news outlets.[152]\nIn addition to the 2019 litigation filed by Giuffre and Dershowitz against each other for defamation in federal court in New York, Dershowitz also filed a defamation lawsuit in U.S. Federal District Court in Miami against Netflix and the producers of Jeffery Epstein: Filthy Rich in May 2021.[153] In 2022, Giuffre, Dershowitz and Boies jointly announced that they had settled their respective lawsuits. Giuffre said that, given the traumatic circumstances of being trafficked by Epstein and her age, she realized that her identification of Dershowitz might have been a mistake.[131] Dershowitz said that his assertion that Boies had engaged in an extortion plot and in suborning perjury was mistaken.[154]\n\nPersonal life and family\nDershowitz's first wife was Sue Barlach.[155][156] In his book Chutzpah, he described Barlach as an \"Orthodox Jewish girl.\"[155] The two met during high school at a Jewish summer camp in the Catskills.[10] They married in 1959, when Dershowitz was 20 and Barlach was 18.[155] Barlach and Dershowitz had two sons together: Elon Dershowitz (born 1961), a film producer,[157] and Jamin Dershowitz (born 1963),[10] an attorney.[158] Barlach and Dershowitz separated in 1973 and divorced in 1976.[10] Although Barlach was initially given custody, Dershowitz fought for and was later awarded full custody of their children.[10] During the divorce proceedings, Barlach alleged that Dershowitz physically abused her, resulting in the need for medical treatment and therapy.[159] The New Yorker reported that Barlach later worked as a research librarian and \"drowned in the East River, in an apparent suicide\" on December 31, 1983.[10]\nIn 1986, Dershowitz married Carolyn Cohen, a retired neuropsychologist.[26] Together they had one child, Ella (born 1990), an actress.[160] Dershowitz and Cohen divide their time between homes in Martha's Vineyard, Miami Beach and Manhattan.[160]\nJamin Dershowitz married Barbara, a Roman Catholic, which helped prompt Alan Dershowitz to write The Vanishing American Jew, dedicated to them and their children, whom Dershowitz regards as Jewish.[20] He has two grandchildren by Jamin: Lori and Lyle.[33]\nDershowitz was related to Los Angeles Conservative rabbi Zvi Dershowitz.[161]\n\nAwards and recognitions\nDershowitz was named a Guggenheim Fellow in 1979, and in 1983 received the William O. Douglas First Amendment Award from the Anti-Defamation League for his work on civil rights.[162] In November 2007, he was awarded the Soviet Jewry Freedom Award by the Russian Jewish Community Foundation.[163] In December 2011, he was awarded the Menachem Begin Award of Honor by the Menachem Begin Heritage Center at an event co-sponsored by NGO Monitor.[164] He has been awarded honorary doctorates in law from Yeshiva University, the Hebrew Union College, Monmouth University, University of Haifa, Syracuse University, Fitchburg State College, Bar-Ilan University, and Brooklyn College.[3] He is a member of the International Advisory Board of NGO Monitor.[165]\nDershowitz has appeared as himself in the television series Picket Fences, Spin City, and First Monday,[166] and in the 2019 documentary No Safe Spaces.[167]\n\nIn popular culture\nIn the film Reversal of Fortune (1990), Dershowitz was portrayed by Ron Silver.[168]\nEvan Handler portrays Dershowitz in the 2016 television series The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story.[169]\nOn Saturday Night Live, Jon Lovitz played Dershowitz, who ends up in Hell during a near-death experience, where he encounters Jeffrey Epstein.[170]\n\nWorks\n\n1982: The Best Defense.

In a joint statement announcing the settlement, Ms. Giuffre said, \"I have long believed that I was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to Alan Dershowitz. However, I was very young at the time, it was a very stressful and traumatic environment, and Mr. Dershowitz has from the beginning consistently denied these allegations. I now recognize I may have made a mistake in identifying Mr. Dershowitz,\" her statement said. The joint statement announced the end of litigation between Ms. Giuffre and Mr. Dershowitz \u2014 who had also sued her \u2014 as well as of two other lawsuits between Mr. Dershowitz and the lawyer David Boies that stemmed from Ms. Giuffre's accusation.\n\n^ a b \"US lawyer in Andrew sex case sued\".

During his Lakeland years, he attended Southside Baptist Church.[2] Mohler attended college at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton in Palm Beach County as a Faculty Scholar. He then received a Bachelor of Arts from Samford University, a private, coeducational Baptist-affiliated college in Birmingham, Alabama. His Master of Divinity and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in systematic and historical theology were conferred by the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn addition to his presidency at SBTS, Mohler was the host of The Albert Mohler Program, a nationwide radio show \"devoted to engaging contemporary culture with Christian beliefs.\"[4] He currently produces a weekday podcast on the news, The Briefing, in which he provides commentary on current events from a Christian point of view, often providing a historical background as well.[5]  He also regularly broadcasts interviews with various different people on a podcast called Thinking in Public.[6] He is former vice chairman of the board of Focus on the Family and a member of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood.[7] Mohler has presented lectures or addresses at a variety of conservative evangelical universities.[3]\nMohler served as editor of The Christian Index,[8] the biweekly newsletter of the Georgia Baptist Convention. From 1985 to 1993 he was Associate Editor of the bi-monthly Preaching Magazine.[9] Mohler also served on the Advisory Council for the 2001 English Standard Version (ESV) of the Bible. Mohler previously blogged on Crosswalk.com, a web site maintained by Salem Web Network of Richmond, Virginia.[10] Mohler currently blogs on his website, where his podcasts can also be listened to for free.[11]\nIn 2018, Mohler labeled turmoil in the Southern Baptist Convention as the SBC's \"own horrifying #MeToo moment\" and said it stemmed from \"an unorganized conspiracy of silence\" about sexual misconduct and abuse.[12] He wrote that the SBC's \"issues are far deeper and wider\" than the controversy surrounding Paige Patterson, who'd been moved that day from president to president emeritus of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.[12]\nIn early 2019, explosive newspaper reports of sexual abuse by church leaders and volunteers shook the Southern Baptist Convention, and Mohler called for independent third-party investigations.[13] Just days after the Houston Chronicle's 2019 report of allegations of hundreds of sexual abuse cases (some of which were not reported to law enforcement),[14] Mohler apologized in an interview with the newspaper for supporting a religious leader who was accused of helping conceal sexual abuses at his former church.[15] Some have lauded Mohler, while others have questioned the timing and motivations of these comments.[15] One day after Mohler's remarks to the Houston Chronicle, his Southern Baptist Theological Seminary office released a related statement by him.[15][16]\n\nSouthern Baptist Theological Seminary[edit]\nMohler joined the staff of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1983 as Coordinator of Foundation Support. In 1987, he became Director of Capital Funding, a post he held until 1989. From 1983 to 1989, while still a student, he had served as assistant to then-President Roy Honeycutt.[17] In February 1993, Mohler was appointed the ninth President of the seminary by the institution's board of trustees to succeed Honeycutt.[3]\n\nTheology and other faiths[edit]\nIn 2008, Al Mohler declined to sign An Evangelical Manifesto, publishing a lengthy explanation for his decision.[18] Mohler is an Evangelical and an exclusivist, which means that he believes Jesus is the only way through which an individual can attain salvation or have a relationship with God the Father. As a Calvinist, Mohler believes that human salvation is a free gift from God which cannot be earned by human action or will and is only given to the elect. He has publicly advanced this position with respect to Judaism, Islam,[19] and Catholicism.[20] He recently stated that \"any belief system, any world view, whether it's Zen Buddhism or Hinduism or dialectical materialism for that matter, Marxism, that keeps persons captive and keeps them from coming to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, yes, is a demonstration of Satanic power.\"[19] He believes Muslims are motivated by demonic power[19] and in the months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Mohler characterized Islamic views of Jesus as false and destructive:\n\nI'm no specialist in Islamic theology. I'll let those who are debate whether or not there is that kind of militancy and warrior culture within Islamic theology. But I want to say as a Christian theologian, the biggest problem with Islamic theology is that it kills the soul.\nThe bigger problem with Islam is not that there are those who will kill the body in its name, but that it lies about God [and] presents a false gospel, an un-gospel\u2026 These are difficult things to say. This is not polite.[21]\nThe secular world tends to look at Islam as a function of ethnicity which means seeking to convert these people to Christianity is an insult to them. But Christianity is a trans-ethnic faith, which understands that Christianity is not particular to or captured by any ethnicity, but seeks to reach all persons.\nThe secular world tends to look at Iraq and say, well, it's Muslim, and that's just a fact, and any Christian influence would just be a form of Western imperialism. The Christian has to look at Iraq and see persons desperately in need of the gospel. Compelled by the love and command of Christ, the Christian will seek to take that gospel in loving and sensitive, but very direct, ways to the people of Iraq.[22]\nMedia appearances[edit]\nMohler appeared on MSNBC's Donahue on August 20, 2002.[23] The subject was Christian evangelization of Jews.[23] Mohler and Michael L. Brown, a Messianic Jew, debated this subject as well as Mohler's insistence that salvation lies exclusively in the personal acceptance of Christ before the afterlife with Donahue, a Catholic, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, an Orthodox Jew.[23]\nOn April 15, 2003, Mohler was interviewed by Time[24] on the subject of evangelizing Iraqi Muslims in the form of Christian aid groups.\nOn May 5, 2003, Mohler appeared on NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross to discuss the issue of evangelization of the Iraqis. At issue was whether the coupling of evangelizing with basic human aid relief might be perceived as aggressive or coercive by the Iraqi people, and whether such a perception, if widespread, might place other relief workers in jeopardy. Mohler argued that biblical, evangelical Christianity is not uniquely American, but exists as a movement throughout the world, so that Christian witnessing is not, in his view, to be interpreted as a move on the part of any single nation against the religion of another. At the same time, however, Mohler acknowledged the need for \"sensitivity,\" and distanced himself from the idea that religion coerced. When pressed, Mohler expressed support for the idea of religious freedom as a theoretical matter of law.[25]\nOn December 18, 2004, Mohler debated retired Episcopal bishop John Shelby Spong on Faith Under Fire, a program hosted by Lee Strobel and appearing on PAX, a Christian television network. The subject was the historicity and truthfulness of the Bible.\nOn December 19, 2013, Mohler appeared on CNN to discuss the controversy surrounding comments made by Phil Robertson of Duck Dynasty. GLAAD National Spokesman Wilson Cruz was also on the program.[26]\n\nSpeaking engagements[edit]\nOn November 8\u20139, 2004, Mohler spoke at the annual meeting of the Florida Baptist State Convention.[27]\nOn May 21, 2005, Mohler gave the commencement address at Union University in Jackson, Tennessee. Mohler told graduates they could display the glory of God by telling and defending the truth, sharing the gospel, engaging the culture, changing the world, loving the church and showing the glory of God in their own lives.[28]\nOn February 25, 2014, Mohler delivered a Forum Lecture in the Marriott Center Arena at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. The title of Mohler's lecture was, \"Strengthen the Things that Remain: Human Dignity, Human Rights, and Human Flourishing in a Dangerous Age.\"[29]\n\nJustice Sunday[edit]\nMohler was on the board of directors of Focus on the Family. In this role he was one of the principal organizers of Justice Sunday, a nationally televised event broadcast from Highview Baptist Church, in Louisville on April 24, 2005. Mohler shared the stage with Charles Colson and Focus on the Family founder James Dobson. US Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist appeared at the event via videotape. Another host of the program was Family Research Council president Tony Perkins.\nThe purpose of the broadcast was to mobilize the conservative base in lobbying the United States Senate to curtail debate on the nominations to the federal judiciary made by George W. Bush.\n\nWe want to communicate to all that we are not calling for persons merely to be moral. We want them to be believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, because we don't just need instruction, we need salvation. (..)For far too long, Christians have been concerned to elect the right people to office, and then go back home. We have learned the importance of the electoral process, and yet we're also discovering that that third branch of government, the judiciary, is so very, very important. We have been watching court cases come down the line. In 1973, Roe v. Wade [declared] a woman's right to an abortion. (...)By no stretch of the imagination did the founders of this nation and the framers of that document intend for anyone to be able to read those words and find a right to kill unborn children.\u2014\u200aAlbert Mohler, April 24, 2005[30]\nTheological views[edit]\nOn Catholicism[edit]\nMohler believes the Catholic Church is a \"false church\" that teaches a \"false gospel\" and regards the Papacy as an illegitimate office.[31][32] During a March 13, 2014 podcast of The Briefing, Mohler stated that Evangelicals \"simply cannot accept the legitimacy of the papacy\" and that \"to do otherwise would be to compromise Biblical truth and reverse the Reformation.\"[32] Mohler has denounced Pope Francis for his perceived left-leaning leadership.[33]\nMohler stated that he was one of the original signatories to the Manhattan Declaration because it is a limited ecumenical statement of Christian conviction on the topics of abortion, euthanasia and gay marriage, and not a wide-ranging theological document that subverts confessional integrity. He emphasized that he signed the document in spite of his deep theological disagreements with the Catholic Church.[34]\n\nFamily planning[edit]\nMohler spoke in June 2004, about married adults who choose not to have children.\n\n The Scripture does not even envision married couples who choose not to have children. Christians have bought into this lifestyle and claim childlessness as a legitimate option. It remains a form of rebellion against God's design and order.[35]\nMohler has also been critical of emergency contraceptives that prevent implantation of the fertilized egg, which he believes \"involve nothing less than an early abortion.\"[36]\n\nGender roles and sexuality[edit]\nIn 2017, Mohler signed the Nashville Statement.[37] He opposed the repeal of the US military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy on the grounds of religious liberty.[38] He said of trans people \"We cannot affirm someone in a delusion\" when asked whether Christians should use a person's preferred name.[39]\n\nScience[edit]\nMohler is a young earth creationist.[40]\n\nYoga[edit]\nAccording to Mohler, yoga practice is not consistent with Christianity.\n\n When Christians practice yoga, they must either deny the reality of what yoga represents or fail to see the contradictions between their Christian commitments and their embrace of yoga. The contradictions are not few, nor are they peripheral. The bare fact is that yoga is a spiritual discipline by which the adherent is trained to use the body as a vehicle for achieving consciousness of the divine\u2026 The embrace of yoga is a symptom of our postmodern spiritual confusion\u2026[41]\nAfter voicing his stance on the topic, Mohler stated that he was 'surprised by the depth of the commitment to yoga found on the part of many who identify as Christians'.[42]\n\nLibertarianism[edit]\nMohler has argued that libertarianism is idolatrous, and as a comprehensive world view or fundamental guiding principle for human life, is inconsistent with Christian ideals. He is a proponent of personal liberty, but believes such liberties can run into problems when applied in the political sphere. The more limited economic libertarianism, on the other hand, can be consistent with the \"comprehensive world view that Christianity puts forward.\"[43]\n\nRecognition[edit]\nChristianity Today recognized Mohler as a leader among American evangelicals, and in 2003 Time called him the \"reigning intellectual of the evangelical movement in the U.S.\"[22]\n\nSelected bibliography[edit]\nBooks authored by R.
