Founded in 1994, JW has primarily targeted Democrats, in particular the administrations of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as Hillary Clinton's role in them. It was founded by attorney Larry Klayman, and has been led by Tom Fitton since 2003.\nThe organization has filed lawsuits against government climate scientists. JW has made numerous false and unsubstantiated claims that have been picked up by right-wing news outlets and promoted by conservative figures. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited false claims by Judicial Watch about voter fraud. Various courts have dismissed the vast majority of its lawsuits.[3]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nJudicial Watch was founded in 1994 by attorney and right-wing activist Larry Klayman. Before leaving the organization in 2003, Klayman hired Tom Fitton, who became president of the organization. In October 2016, The New York Times wrote: \"Judicial Watch's strategy is simple: Carpet-bomb the federal courts with Freedom of Information Act lawsuits.\" As of 2016, the organization had nearly fifty employees. Judicial Watch calls itself a nonpartisan educational foundation as well as a media organization. According to the Times, \"the group has forced the release of government records that would otherwise have been kept from the public.\" Critics accuse JW of \"weaponizing the Freedom of Information Act for political purposes.\"[2]\n\nClinton Administration[edit]\nJudicial Watch came to public attention after filing eighteen lawsuits against the administration of Democratic U.S. President Bill Clinton and other figures in the Clinton administration. An early lawsuit was filed by Judicial Watch on behalf of the Western Center for Journalism (WCJ) in 1998. The lawsuit alleged a retaliatory audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The WCJ was investigating the death of Clinton deputy White House counsel Vince Foster at the time.[4]\nThe organization received considerable financial support from prominent Clinton critics, including US$7.74 million from conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife.[5] This led Clinton administration officials to accuse Judicial Watch of \"abusing the judicial system for partisan ends\".[6]\n\nBush administration[edit]\nJudicial Watch was involved in a legal dispute with Vice President Dick Cheney in 2002 when the group filed a shareholder lawsuit against Halliburton. The lawsuit, which accused Halliburton of accounting fraud, alleged that \"when Mr. Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton, he and other directors inflated revenue reports, boosting Halliburton's share price.\"[7] As reported by The Wall Street Journal the court filing claims the oil-field-services concern overstated revenue by a total of $445 million from 1999 through the end of 2001.[8][9]\nIn July 2003 Judicial Watch joined the environmental organization Sierra Club in suing the George W. Bush administration for access to minutes of Vice President Dick Cheney's Energy Task Force.[10]\n\nObama administration[edit]\nJudicial Watch filed over twenty FOIA lawsuits involving the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails.[11]\nIn February 2016, District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted Judicial Watch's motion for discovery into whether the State Department and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deliberately thwarted the FOIA by using a private email server to obscure her communications from public records requests.[12]\nIn March 2020, federal district court judge Royce Lamberth ruled that Clinton must provide a deposition.[13] A three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously overturned Lamberth's ruling in August. The full DC Circuit Court unanimously declined to hear an appeal in October, allowing the panel decision to stand.[14] In March 2021, the United States Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal by Judicial Watch.[15]\n\nTrump administration[edit]\nIn 2020 Judicial Watch obtained copies of emails related to the Steele Dossier through a FOIA lawsuit.[16]\nIn the months prior to the 2020 election, Judicial Watch filed or threatened lawsuits against several states related to alleged inaccuracy of their voter rolls, demanding that nearly two million names be purged.[17]\nIn October 2020, the group sued the state of California, claiming a law requiring corporations doing business in the state to have directors from sexual or racial minorities is unconstitutional, asserting \"The legislation's requirement that certain corporations appoint a specific number of directors based upon race, ethnicity, sexual preference, and transgender status is immediately suspect and presumptively invalid and triggers strict scrutiny review by the court.\"[18] In April 2022, a California judge agreed.[19] In December 2022, a California appeals court also agreed.[20]\nA 2020 study by researchers from Northeastern, Harvard, Northwestern and Rutgers universities found that Judicial Watch was among the top five most shared fake news domains in tweets related to COVID-19, the others being The Gateway Pundit, InfoWars, WorldNetDaily and Natural News.[21]\n\nActivities and controversies[edit]\nJudicial Watch's main targets have been Democrats, particularly Bill and Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration.[22]\n\nCommerce Department trade mission scandal[edit]\nMain article: Commerce Department trade mission controversy\nIn 1995, Judicial Watch, Inc. filed an action in the District Court under the FOIA, seeking information from the Department of Commerce (DOC) regarding DOC's selection of participants for foreign trade missions. In May 1995, following a search in response to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests, DOC produced approximately 28,000 pages of nonexempt information and withheld about 1,000 documents as exempt. Disputes arose between the parties over the adequacy of DOC's search, and Judicial Watch charged that some DOC officials had destroyed or removed responsive documents. In December 1998, following discovery, the District Court granted partial summary judgment to Judicial Watch and ordered DOC to perform a new search.[23] During the investigation, Nolanda B. Hill, a business partner of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown testified that Brown had told her that first lady Hillary Clinton was the driving force behind the efforts to raise as much money as possible for President Clinton's reelection and the DNC. And further that, \"...companies were being solicited to donate large sums of money in exchange for their selection to participate on trade missions of the Commerce Department.\"[24]\n\nVince Foster conspiracy theory[edit]\nJudicial Watch helped promote the conspiracy theory that Vince Foster was murdered by the Clintons, and still has yet to provide convincing proof.[25][22]\n\nWhite House visitor logs[edit]\nAugust 10, 2009 Judicial Watch sent a FOIA request to the US Secret Service asking that official White House visitor logs be made public. In August 2011, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ordered the agency to process the group's data request.[26] The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia partially affirmed the decision, holding that the Secret Service did not have to produce records of visitors to the president's office.[26]\n\nFalse Nancy Pelosi claims[edit]\nIn 2010, Judicial Watch made inaccurate claims about air travel spending by Nancy Pelosi's congressional delegation; Judicial Watch's claims were picked up by the conservative conspiracy site WorldNetDaily.[27] Judicial Watch also made false claims about Pelosi's air travel in 2008.[28]\n\nOperation Neptune Spear[edit]\nOsama bin Laden, leader of the terror group al-Qaeda, was killed in Pakistan on May 1, 2011, in a joint operation by the United States Navy SEALs and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This operation was code-named Operation Neptune Spear.[29] On May 2, 2011, Judicial Watch filed a FOIA request with the Department of Defense and the CIA for photographs and videos of bin Laden taken during or after the operation.[30]\nThe government failed to produce any records within the required twenty days. In order to force compliance, Judicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit against the DOD and CIA on June 8, 2011. On January 31, 2014, after legal wrangling, the Pentagon released Operation Neptune Spear documents to Judicial Watch. One email had the subject line OPSEC Guidance / Neptune Spear and is proof that days after the original FOIA request U.S. Special Operations Commander, Admiral William McRaven ordered his subordinates to immediately destroy any Osama bin Laden photos they may have had.[31]\n\nBill Clinton/Taylor Branch tapes[edit]\nIn 2012, Judicial Watch sued the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in an attempt to force NARA to declare audio tapes held at the William J. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum of Bill Clinton to be presidential records, seize them, and release them to Judicial Watch. During Clinton's tenure in office, he had allowed historian Taylor Branch to interview him privately for a book Branch was planning to write. It was published in 2009 under the title \"The Clinton Tapes\". NARA had declined to deem the tapes to be \"presidential records\", and the federal judge dismissed the lawsuit stating that \"the relief that plaintiff seeks \u2013 that the Archivist assume 'custody and control' of the audiotapes \u2013 is not available under the PRA.\"[32][33][34] This case was called the \"Clinton socks case\" by former president Trump because the tapes were said to have been stored in Clinton's socks drawer.[35]\n\nKennedy assassination records[edit]\nJudicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit against the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to obtain the records from Robert F. Kennedy's time as the Attorney General. The records covered sensitive intelligence operations conducted during the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson administrations.[36]\n\nHillary Clinton email lawsuits[edit]\nJudicial Watch has currently filed twenty FOIA lawsuits involving the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails.[11]\nOn February 8, 2016, the FBI confirmed it was investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. The Bureau was forced to formally acknowledge the investigation due to an ongoing FOIA lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch. FBI director James Comey had previously referenced the investigation, although the FBI had declined to confirm or deny it in court filings.[37]\nA federal judge ruled on February 23, 2016, that top aides to Hillary Clinton could be questioned under oath by Judicial Watch about her use of a private email server as secretary of state. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted Judicial Watch's motion for discovery into whether the State Department and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deliberately thwarted the Freedom of Information Act by using a private email server to obscure her communications from public records requests.[12]\nIn May 2016 U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted \"discovery\" to Judicial Watch into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email system. This ruling allowed Judicial Watch to question two close Clinton aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, under oath. In a separate FOIA lawsuit concerning Hillary Clinton and the Benghazi terrorist attack, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled Judicial Watch can conduct discovery into the email practices of Clinton and her top aides.[38]\nIn a separate case, on March 29, 2016, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth granted Judicial Watch limited discovery, citing potential bad faith by the government in responding to requests for documents related to talking points provided to Susan Rice in response to the Benghazi attack.[39]\nA FOIA lawsuit by Judicial Watch led to the release of 2,800 e-mails from Clinton aide Huma Abedin that were found on the laptop computer of Anthony Weiner, Abedin's estranged husband. Five of the e-mails were classified.[40]\n\nFalse claims about George Zimmerman protests[edit]\nIn 2013, Judicial Watch claimed that the Department of Justice under the Obama administration organized protests against George Zimmerman after the Trayvon Martin shooting; PolitiFact said that this was \"mostly false\" and that while Justice Department employees were sent to Florida, they \"were sent with the idea of keeping the situation peaceful and calm, not to instigate or condone protests or violence.\"[41]\n\nIslamic State in Mexico scares[edit]\nIn 2014 and 2015, Judicial Watch falsely claimed that Islamic State (ISIS) had set up camp in Mexico; Judicial Watch's claims were picked up by several right-wing news outlets.[42][43][44][25][45]\n\nCollaboration with Steve Bannon and Breitbart News[edit]\nIn 2013, Judicial Watch collaborated with Steve Bannon, executive chairman of the alt-right website Breitbart News, on the film \"District of Corruption\", which critiqued the Obama administration.[46] Judicial Watch paid Bannon's group Victory Film Project $382,143 for the film.[46] Politico described the film as an \"infomercial for the work of Judicial Watch\".[47]\nJudicial Watch has advertised on Breitbart for a number of years.[48] Judicial Watch's president Tom Fitton said \"Liberal activists want to destroy Breitbart, but we won't be cowed\".[48]\n\nMurder of Seth Rich conspiracy theory[edit]\nFurther information: Murder of Seth Rich\nIn 2017, Judicial Watch requested documents related to the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich; Seth Rich's death led to debunked right-wing conspiracy theories alleging that Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party had him killed.[49]\n\nFalse voter fraud claims[edit]\nIn August 2017, Judicial Watch falsely alleged that 11 California counties had more registered voters than their estimated populations of citizens eligible to vote; the claims were picked up by outlets such as Breitbart News and Russian propaganda network RT (Russia Today).[50] Judicial Watch counted \"inactive voters\" in its tally, which is a list of people that California maintains of people who have been removed from active rolls after a mail ballot, voter guide or other official document was returned as undeliverable; California keeps such a list as a fail-safe in case eligible voters have been erroneously categorized as \"inactive\".[50] California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said Judicial Watch's claims were \"baseless\", and \"bad math and dubious methodology\".[50][51] When the Los Angeles Times asked Judicial Watch to share its analysis of voter registration in California, Judicial Watch declined.[51] Judicial Watch's voter fraud claims came in the wake of President Donald Trump's false claims of extensive voter fraud in California during the 2016 presidential election.[51] Trump has subsequently repeatedly promoted Judicial Watch's false claims about voter fraud.[52]\nOn February 3, 2020, the day of the Iowa caucuses in the Democratic presidential primary, JW president Tom Fitton suggested that voter fraud was afoot in Iowa by falsely claiming that \"eight Iowa counties have more voter registrations than citizens old enough to register.\" The false assertion went viral on social media.[53][54] Iowa's Secretary of State, Paul Pate, a member of the Republican Party, debunked Fitton's claim by linking to official voter registration data.[55][56]\nFitton has made alarmist claims about voter fraud, saying \"We have all heard about voter fraud and the attempts by liberal media organs like the New York Times and Ivory Tower academics to dismiss it as a nonexistent problem. But is it real, widespread, and substantial to the point that it can decide elections.\"[57]\n\nFalse claims about Trump Nazi billboard[edit]\nIn 2017, Judicial Watch claimed that taxpayer money went into a billboard which depicted President Donald Trump as a Nazi.  Further investigation showed that \"while the owner of the billboard founded the group that received city funding for the Art Detour event during which the Trump image went up, the billboard project itself did not receive city funding\".[58]\n\nLawsuits against climate scientists[edit]\nJudicial Watch has filed lawsuits seeking to force the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to release the correspondence of climate scientists who published a 2015 study in the journal Science.[59] The study had debunked one of the common claims made by those who reject the scientific consensus on climate change, namely that there existed global warming \"hiatus\" between 1998 and 2012. The Climate Science Legal Defense Fund (CSLDF), American Meteorological Society and Union of Concerned Scientists condemned Judicial Watch, saying that the disclosure of private communications between scientists \"would harm (or halt altogether) government scientists' ability to collaborate with colleagues, damage the government's ability to recruit or retain top scientists, and deter critically important research into politically charged fields like climate change\". The Judicial Watch lawsuit was inspired by Rep. Lamar Smith, a climate change denier[60] who had accused the authors of the study of \"alter[ing] data\" to \"get the politically correct results they want.\"[61]\n\nMueller and FBI investigations into Russian interference[edit]\nIn 2017, Judicial Watch helped to stoke Republican attacks against Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[62] Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton has called for the Special Counsel investigation to be shut down, arguing that prosecutors in the probe were too biased against President Trump to conduct a credible investigation, a claim rejected by Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Bob Corker.[63]  Fitton furthermore called for shutting down the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) based on the claim that the Obama administration had turned it into a \"KGB-type operation.\"[64][65]\n\nAccusations against the Clinton Foundation[edit]\nIn January 2018, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton repeated accusations against the Clinton Foundation that it had funneled money intended for charity work in Haiti to pay for Chelsea Clinton's wedding.[66] The Washington Post fact-checked the claim a year earlier and found that it was \"lacking any evidence\".[66]\n\nGeorge Soros smears[edit]\nFurther information: George Soros conspiracy theories\nIn October 2018, Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch stirred controversy when he appeared on Lou Dobbs' Fox Business show and used what many described as an anti-Semitic trope to suggest that the State Department was \"Soros-occupied\" territory. The remark echoed the anti-Semitic trope of a \"Zionist-occupied government\" to refer to Jewish control of the U.S. government.[67][68] After widespread condemnation, Fox stated that Farrell would no longer be booked.[69][68]\nFarrell promoted the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that a migrant caravan traveling through Central America towards the United States was being directed or funded by the \"Soros-occupied State Department\".[70] Judicial Watch had been engaged in what NPR described as a \"full-throated campaign against Soros\". Among other things, Judicial Watch raised money by running ads with a call to action: \"Expose Soros!\"[70][71]\n\nSenator's letters to IRS[edit]\nAccording to Media Matters for America, in 2015, Judicial Watch claimed that three newly obtained letters sent by Democratic senator Carl Levin to the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service \"discuss how to target conservative groups the senator claimed were 'engaged in political activities'.\" Media Matters for America reported that Judicial Watch provided a link to the documents on its site, but said it failed to note that one Levin letter did not mention conservatives, while the other two mentioned an equal number of liberal/Democrat and conservative/Republican entities. The Judicial Watch claim was amplified by several conservative media outlets.[72]\n\nStatue removal[edit]\nJudicial Watch has sought to remove a statue of Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa from downtown Tucson.[73] Judicial Watch said the statue \"needs to go\" because \"Pancho Villa did great harm to people.\"[73]\n\n2020 election voter suppression[edit]\nIn 2020, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton urged attendees of an event organized by the Council for National Policy to prevent mail-in ballots from being sent to voters, saying \"We need to stop those ballots from going out, and I want the lawyers here to tell us what to do.\"[74]\n\nLarry Klayman lawsuits[edit]\nIn 2003, Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman left the organization to run for the United States Senate from Florida.[75] In 2006, Klayman sued Judicial Watch and its president, Tom Fitton. Judicial Watch asserted several claims against Klayman as well; in 2019, Judicial Watch obtained a $2.8 million verdict against Klayman on its claims of breaches of the severance agreement and trademark infringement.[76]\nIn 2012, a Judicial Watch employee falsely told Orly Taitz that Klayman had been convicted of not paying child support (Klayman had been indicted, but the charges were later dismissed). Taitz then published the employee's comment on her website. Klayman sued Judicial Watch for defamation, and in 2014, a federal jury awarded Klayman $156,000 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages.[77]\nIn 2017, Freedom Watch (Klayman's successor organization to Judicial Watch) unsuccessfully sued Judicial Watch and the American Conservative Union (ACU), alleging they violated the Sherman Act by colluding to prevent Freedom Watch from participating at the ACU's Conservative Political Action Conference.[78]\nKlayman had represented three individuals who sued Judicial Watch, his former employer and client, but he failed to obtain Judicial Watch's consent to waive his conflict of interest. Klayman maintained that the D.C. Bar had \"recognized there was no evidence of dishonesty or personal gain\".[79]  In 2020, however, the D.C. Court of Appeals suspended Klayman's license for 90 days and ordered him to complete a class on legal ethics.[80]\n\nPeter Paul lawsuit[edit]\nIn 2007 former donor Peter F. Paul sued Judicial Watch, accusing it of using his name to raise more than $15 million to support his lawsuit against Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton while doing little to advance his case.[81][82][83]  All of Paul's claims were dismissed.[84][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n\nFunding[edit]\nAs of 2016, Judicial Watch had an annual budget of about $35 million.[2] Between 1997 and 2002 Judicial Watch received $7,069,500 in 19 grants from a handful of foundations. The bulk of this funding came from three foundations: the Sarah Scaife Foundation, a funder of politically conservative causes;[85] The Carthage Foundation, which merged into the Sarah Scaife Foundation in 2014;[86][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] and the John M. Olin Foundation, Inc.[87] As of 2010, the Sarah Scaife Foundation was the group's largest contributor.[88]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Judicial Watch Inc\". projects.propublica.org. Propublica.

Sheindlin describes her mother Ethel, an office manager,[12] as \"a meat and potatoes kind of gal\".[13]\nSheindlin graduated from James Madison High School in Brooklyn in 1961 and American University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in government. She next attended New York Law School, earning her Juris Doctor degree in 1965.[14]\n\nLegal career[edit]\nSheindlin passed the New York state bar examination in 1965 and was hired as a corporate lawyer for a cosmetics firm. Within two years, she became dissatisfied with her job and left to raise her children Jamie and Adam. In 1972, she became a prosecutor in the New York family-court system after hearing about the job from a friend. In her role as a lawyer, Sheindlin prosecuted cases involving child abuse, domestic violence and juvenile offenders.[1]\nBy 1982, Sheindlin's attitude inspired New York mayor Ed Koch to appoint her as a criminal-court judge. Four years later, she was promoted to supervising judge in the family court's Manhattan division.[1] She earned a reputation as a tough New York City judge (although she has disagreed with the labels \"tough\" and \"harsh\").[15]\n\nEntertainment career[edit]\nIn February 1993, Sheindlin's reputation made her the subject of a Los Angeles Times article written by Josh Getlin (inspired by his wife Heidi, both of whom Sheindlin credits with her rise to fame)[16] that profiled her as a woman determined to make the court system work for the common good. She was then featured in a segment on CBS's 60 Minutes that brought her national recognition. This led to her first book, Don't Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It's Raining, published in 1996. She retired as a family-court judge that same year after having heard more than 20,000 cases.[1]\n\nJudge Judy[edit]\nMain article: Judge Judy\nJudge Judy stands next to a portrait of herself (2005)\nA little over a year after the 60 Minutes special, Sheindlin accepted an offer in 1995 to preside in a new reality courtroom series, featuring \"real cases with real rulings.\" Her syndicated court show Judge Judy debuted on September 16, 1996 and ran for 25 seasons until July 23, 2021.[17] She was accompanied by her bailiff, Petri Byrd, simply called \"Byrd\" or \"Officer Byrd\", who became the longest-serving bailiff in courtroom programming history.[18] Their work relationship predated the program, as Byrd had served as Sheindlin's bailiff in the Manhattan family-court system.[19]\nThrough its 25-season run, Judge Judy remained the top Nielsen-rated court show and regularly drew nine to ten million viewers daily,[20] occasionally besting the ratings of The Oprah Winfrey Show.[21] From 2009 to its series finale in 2021, Judge Judy was the highest-rated show in all of daytime television programming and first-run syndication.[22] During the show's active run, author Brendan I. Koerner commented on its popularity:\n\nCourt-show viewers don't seem to want moral conundrums or technical wrinkles. They love Sheindlin's show because she offers them a fantasy of how they'd like the justice system to operate\u2014swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there certainly are no lengthy appeals.[23]\nA 2013 Reader's Digest poll revealed that Americans trusted Judge Judy more than they did all nine justices of the United States Supreme Court.[24]\nIn 2003, VH1 named Sheindlin in its 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons list.[25] References to Sheindlin have appeared in many television programs, including Jimmy Kimmel Live!,[24] The Simpsons, Will & Grace, America's Next Top Model, The Weakest Link, The Practice, the Academy Awards telecasts, Betty White's 2nd Annual 90th Birthday,[26] RuPaul's Drag Race, Saturday Night Live and The Amanda Show.\nThe Judge Judy courtroom series earned Sheindlin numerous awards and honors, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February 2006,[27] induction into Broadcasting & Cable's Hall of Fame in October 2012,[28][29] an award from the vice presidency of the UCD Law Society in April 2013,[30] the Gracie Allen Tribute Award from the Alliance for Women in Media[25] and the Mary Pickford Award from the Hollywood Chamber Community Foundation at the 2014 Heroes of Hollywood.[31]\nOn June 14, 2013, Judge Judy won its first Daytime Emmy Award after having received its 15th nomination. The program won again in 2016 and 2017.[32] In an interview with Entertainment Tonight (ET) on May 3, 2013, Sheindlin was asked about her failure to win after 14 nominations and said:\n\nI don't know. You know, somehow it would sort of break the spell. The show has been such a tremendous success that I'm almost afraid to think about winning\u2014because so many of those shows that did win are no longer with us. So I say to myself 'you want the Emmy or you want a job? (laughing) Which one do you want?'[33]\nOn September 14, 2015, Guinness World Records recognized Sheindlin as the longest-serving judge or arbiter in courtroom-themed programming history and as having the longest-running courtroom show.[34]\nSheindlin has drawn considerable attention and made headlines over her substantial salary from the program. In early 2005, Sheindlin's salary was reportedly US$25 million per year.[23] Her net worth at the beginning of 2007 was $95 million, and she ranked #13 on the Forbes list of the 20 richest women in entertainment.[35] In January 2008 when Sheindlin's contract was renewed, her salary increased to $45 million per year.\nSheindlin briefly considered retirement in early 2010. Her contract was set to end after the 2013-14 television season.[36] She was quoted at the time as stating, \"I think 2013 would be a nice time. It's nice to leave on top. I would consider this a great adventure.\"\nOn March 30, 2011, Sheindlin was admitted to the hospital after she fainted on the set of her show while handling a case. She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she had suffered a mini-stroke.[37]\nIn May 2011, Sheindlin's contract was extended through the 19th season with an annual salary increase by CBS to $47 million.[38][39] Her annual salary translated into just over $900,000 per workday (she worked 52 days per year taping cases for Judge Judy).[40] According to Forbes, Sheindlin earned $147 million (pretax) in 2017.[41] It was reported by TV Guide Magazine in October 2013 that Sheindlin was the highest-paid TV star.[42] She later stated that her retirement was up to her viewers and said that fans still seemed to be interested.[43] She said, \"I'm not tired. I still feel engaged by what I do, and I still have people who like to watch it.\"[44]\nIn August 2017, CBS Television Distribution and Sheindlin signed a contract extension through the 2020-21 television season.[45] She later revealed in a March 2020 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that the series would conclude by its 25th-season anniversary.[46] The final taped case aired on June 8, 2021, and the series finale aired on July 23, 2021.[47] Sheindlin ended the series while discontented with ViacomCBS and facing lawsuits from Rebel Entertainment, also stating that \"25 is a good round number\" with which to finish.[48]\nTo honor the 25th and final season of the series, Josh Getlin (writer of the 1993 Los Angeles Times article that brought Sheindlin into the spotlight[49]) wrote another article on Sheindlin. The article was posted on June 8, 2021 (the same day on which the final taped case aired) and explained the background of the 1993 article and Getlin's relationship with Sheindlin.[49]\n\nJudy Justice[edit]\nMain article: Judy Justice\nPremiering on November 1, 2021, with production that commenced in July 2021 (shortly after production of Judge Judy ended in April 2021),[4][5] Sheindlin currently presides over another arbitration-based courtroom series, Judy Justice, a spinoff of Judge Judy. The program is aired through streaming service Amazon Freevee (originally under the name IMDb TV during the show's first season). It is the first standard court show to air first-run episodes exclusively through streaming.\nThe court show has been characterized as a \"hip\" rendition of Judge Judy, featuring Gen Z input from Sheindlin's young-adult granddaughter, frequent use of a stenographer to quote testimony to settle discrepancies, Sheindlin's conspicuous robe color, a modernized courtroom set and cases that have been described as more sensational because of fewer time constraints and higher monetary award limits than on Judge Judy.[50][51]\nWhile Sheindlin has promised to use the same adjudicating techniques that she had employed on Judge Judy, she has lessened her no-nonsense approach, delving deeper into case details, with most episodes focusing on a single long case. Her previous program typically hosted two cases per episode and was known for its aggressive pacing.[52]\nAfter a pre-series debut trailer was released on September 30, 2021, Judy Justice drew early criticism from much of Sheindlin's Judge Judy fanbase over the absence of Bailiff Byrd;[53][54][55] Kevin Rasco serves as Sheindlin's Judy Justice bailiff. In October 2021, Byrd stated that he was \"confused\" and \"dismayed\" by Sheindlin's lack of communication with him regarding the spinoff. Byrd claimed that Sheindlin omitted him from the series for monetary reasons. In a public statement, Sheindlin praised Byrd as \"terrific\", but added that the show needed a new and exciting direction.[56][57][58] Byrd ultimately expressed that he held no grudges, was grateful to Sheindlin and wished her luck with Judy Justice.[59][60][61]\nOn April 28, 2022, it was announced that Byrd would appear in Tribunal Justice, a courtroom series created and produced by Sheindlin and her production team. Tribunal Justice will feature former Hot Bench judges Tanya Acker and Patricia DiMango along with Sheindlin's son, former district attorney Adam Levy.[62]\nIn April 2022, viewership of Judge Judy reruns was found to have vastly outperformed that of Judy Justice's first season.[63] However, the first season of Judy Justice set a record for the number of streaming hours viewed on IMDb TV for its first season, and was thus granted a second season, which premiered on November 7, 2022.[64][65] Sheindlin won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program for the first season of the series, making her the only television arbitrator to have won the award for more than one court show (both Judge Judy and Judy Justice).[6]\n\nExternal media appearances and participation[edit]\nSheindlin has been interviewed on many talk and news broadcasts over the course of her career, on programs such as Entertainment Tonight, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Wendy Williams Show,[66] Katie,[67] Larry King Live,[68] The Roseanne Show, The View, Donny & Marie,[69] The Talk,[70] The Tonight Show, Dateline NBC, 20/20 and[71] Good Morning America.[72] On October 17, 1998, Sheindlin made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, comedically interrupting Cheri Oteri's parody of her on Judge Judy.[73] That same year, Sheindlin appeared as herself in a cameo scene from the Judge Judy show in the 1998 American made-for-television crime drama film CHiPs '99.[74] She also served as a judge for the 1999 Miss America pageant.[66]\nOn February 21, 2000, a 60-minute documentary film about Sheindlin's life and career titled Judge Judy: Sitting in Judgment aired as part of the Biography series.[75][76] On December 23, 2008, Sheindlin was a guest on Shatner's Raw Nerve.[77] In December 2009, Sheindlin again told her story in a two-hour interview for the Archive of American Television.[78] She launched a short-lived advice-sharing website, whatwouldjudysay.com, in May 2012. In a September 17, 2013 interview with Katie Couric for the 92nd Street Y, Sheindlin elaborated on previously undisclosed facts of her life story and career in the family court.[79][80]\nIn 2014, Sheindlin founded her own production company, Queen Bee Productions, which produced the arbitration-based reality courtroom series Hot Bench.[81] Sheindlin had originally desired the title of Hot Bench for her Judge Judy show.[82][83][84] Hot Bench, which debuted on September 15, 2014, featured a panel of three judges debating and deciding on courtroom cases. Sheindlin stated, \"When my husband Jerry and I were in Ireland recently, we visited the courts and watched a three-judge bench, which I found both fascinating and compelling. I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds to serve as the judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a hot bench.\" The original panel of judges consisted of New York State Supreme Court judge Patricia DiMango and Los Angeles attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman, but Bakman was replaced by Michael Corriero. As with Judge Judy, Hot Bench was produced by Randy Douthit and CBS Television Distribution.[85][86]\nOn August 31, 2016, it was reported that CBS had planned a scripted, semi-autobiographical drama series based on the life of Sheindlin titled Her Honor. The show was described as following the youngest judge in New York who, while proficient at handling family court cases, has a personal life that needs work. Executive producers of the program were to include Sheindlin, Chernuchin, Arnold Kopelson and Anne Kopelson. Chernuchin was a writer for the legal drama series Law & Order.[87][88][89]\nIn 2017, Sheindlin created a game show titled IWitness that debuted on July 10 and ran for six weeks. The show tested contestants' observational skills, requiring them to view video clips and recall what they have witnessed faster than do their competitors.[90] On September 17, 2017, Sheindlin appeared on the series premiere of Fox News' Objectified, hosted by Harvey Levin. The program's first episode took an inside look at Sheindlin's life.[91]\nIn September 2017, the National Enquirer issued a formal apology for having published false statements defaming Sheindlin as having cheated on her husband and having suffered from Alzheimer's disease and brain damage. The magazine also apologized to Sheindlin's daughter Nicole for having stated that she had a prison record.[92]\nSheindlin and her program appeared on a November 26, 2017, episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, presiding over a sketch-comedy court case with Larry David as the plaintiff. The case took the appearance of an actual case from Sheindlin's program, with its courtroom set, voiceover briefs, theme music and audience response.[93]\nIn 2018, Sheindlin appeared as a guest on Norm Macdonald Has a Show on Netflix.[94]\n\nNon-media projects and community work[edit]\nSheindlin, along with her stepdaughter Nicole Sheindlin, is the creator, director and spokesperson for an alliance designed to empower young women entitled \"Her Honor Mentoring.\"[95][96]\nIn September 2017, Sheindlin funded a space for public debate at the University of Southern California. The purpose of the forum was for \"free exchange of ideas by well-meaning people.\"[97]\n\nAuthoring and literature projects[edit]\nSheindlin, Judith (1996).

What Would Judy Say: Be the Hero of Your Own Story.\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 1964, Judy married Ronald Levy, who later became a prosecutor in juvenile court. They moved to New York and had two children, Jamie Hartwright and Adam Levy.[1] Her son Adam is a former district attorney for Putnam County, New York, and is now a co-star in Tribunal Justice.[99] Sheindlin and Levy divorced in 1976 after 12 years of marriage.[1]\nIn 1978, she married Judge Jerry Sheindlin, who later became an arbitrator on The People's Court from 1999 to 2001.[1] They divorced in 1990, partially as a result of the stress and struggles that Judy endured after her father's death that same year.[1] They remarried in 1991. She has three stepchildren with Sheindlin: Gregory Sheindlin, Jonathan Sheindlin and Nicole Sheindlin, and 13 grandchildren.[1] Jonathan is a retinal surgeon,[100] and Greg and Nicole are lawyers. Nicole is the co-creator (along with her stepmother) of the Her Honor Mentoring program.\nSheindlin owns homes in several states, including New York,[101] Florida,[102] California, and Wyoming.[103] She commuted to Los Angeles every other week for two to four days to tape episodes of Judge Judy.[44][101] In May 2013, she bought a $10.7 million condominium in the Los Angeles suburb of Beverly Hills.[104] In 2018, Sheindlin and her husband announced spending $9 million on the Bird House, a 9,700-square-foot (900\u00a0m2) property on 3.67 acres (1.49\u00a0ha) in Newport, Rhode Island once owned by Dorrance Hill Hamilton.[105]\nSheindlin holds honorary Doctor of Law degrees from Elizabethtown College and the University at Albany, SUNY.[106] In 2013, she was made vice-president of the law society at University College Dublin, Ireland, in recognition of her work in family law.[107]\nSheindlin is a registered Independent.[108] She is a supporter of same-sex marriage and,[109] although she has said that she is not a supporter of \"big government\", she believes that the issue of same-sex marriage should be handled at the federal level rather than on a state-by-state basis.[110] Sheindlin has stated that she is in favor of increasing requirements for gun ownership.[111] She prefers not to be labelled by political terms, and states that she is not registered with any political party. When asked about the 2012 presidential elections, Sheindlin stated that while she voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 (as well as voting for Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, respectively in 1980 and 1984, and 1992 and 1996), she did not care for either of the leading candidates in the 2012 United States presidential election.[112] In October 2019 Sheindlin penned an op-ed endorsing Michael Bloomberg for president, despite the fact that he had not announced a campaign.[113] In January 2020 she released an ad supporting him.[114] In the 2024 election, she endorsed candidate Nikki Haley for president.[115]\n\nLawsuits[edit]\nIn March 2013, a lawsuit was filed against Sheindlin by Patrice Jones, the estranged wife of Randy Douthit (executive producer of Sheindlin's Judge Judy and later Judy Justice court shows). Jones alleged Douthit and Sheindlin had conspired to permit Sheindlin to buy Christofle fine china and Marley cutlery owned by Jones. She said Sheindlin had paid Douthit $50,815 for the items without her knowledge to deprive her of her valuables,[116] and she sought $514,421 from Sheindlin. The suit was settled out of court after Sheindlin returned the tableware to Douthit, and Jones agreed to pay him $12,500 and have the tableware returned to her.[117]\nOn March 12, 2014, Sheindlin filed a lawsuit against Hartford, Connecticut personal injury lawyer John Haymond and his law firm. In the lawsuit, Sheindlin accused Haymond and his firm of using her television image without consent in advertisements that falsely suggested she endorsed him and his firm. Sheindlin's producer allegedly told the firm that use of her image is not permitted in March 2013, but ads continued to be produced. The lawsuit filed in federal court sought more than $75,000 in damages. Sheindlin said in her statement that any money she wins through the lawsuit will go toward college scholarships through the Her Honor Mentoring program. Sheindlin further stated, \"Mr. Haymond is a lawyer and should know better. The unauthorized use of my name is outrageous and requires legal action.\"[118][119][120] Haymond later filed a countersuit for punitive damages and attorney's fees, alleging defamation of him and his firm by Sheindlin. Haymond insisted that local affiliates asked him to appear in Judge Judy promos to promote Sheindlin for which he obliged.[121][122] On August 8, 2014, it was reported that the case between Sheindlin and Haymond settled out of court in a resolution that favored Sheindlin. Haymond donated money to Sheindlin's charity, Her Honor Mentoring.[123]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k \"Judge Judy Biography \u2013 Judge, Author, Reality Television Star (1942\u2013)\".

Established in 1835, it is the oldest law school in New York City and the oldest surviving law school in New York State. Located in Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan, NYU Law offers J.D., LL.M., and J.S.D. degrees in law.\nNYU Law alumni include judges at the International Court of Justice,[3] Nobel laureates,[4][5] lawyers such as David Boies, Amal Alamuddin Clooney, Jeremy Waldron and Thomas Nagel, and Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives Hakeem Jeffries.[6] NYU Law private practice lawyers include the four founders of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore partner and former chairman Evan Chesler,[7] the leading law firms in the United States. The current president of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Deborah N. Archer, is a Clinical Professor and member of the faculty.\nAccording to the school's ABA-required disclosures, NYU Law's bar passage rate is 94.9% in 2023, the sixth highest in the United States.[8][9]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nNew York University School of Law was founded in 1835, making it the oldest law school in New York City.[10] It is also the oldest surviving law school in New York State and one of the oldest in the United States. The only law school in the state to precede it was a small institution conducted by Peter van Schaack in Kinderhook, New York, from 1785 to his death in 1832.[11] Founded just four years after the establishment of New York University,[12] NYU Law is also the university's oldest professional school.[13]\nThe school was founded by Benjamin Franklin Butler, the United States Attorney General, at the request of the Council of the New York University. Butler submitted to the chancellor of the university, James M. Mathews, a \"Plan for the organization of a law faculty in the University of the City of New York,\"[11] which defined a three-year course of study.[13] This plan was formally accepted by the university council on June 2, 1835, marking the inception of the school of law. Instruction began, and Butler was elected the school's first principal professor in March 1838.[11] The curriculum he instituted was the first in the country to teach law using the \"course method,\" which came to be adopted as the standard for legal education in the United States.[13]\nNYU School of Law was one of the first law schools in the United States to admit women, beginning in 1890.[10] The Metropolitan Law School was absorbed by NYU School of Law in 1895, and became its evening division. The law school began raising its standards for admission in the early 20th century. In 1924, it required that all students have had completed at least one year of undergraduate education or its equivalent. This was increased to two undergraduate years in 1926, in conformity with the American Bar Association's recommendation.[14]\nThe law school relocated to its present location of 40 Washington Square South in Greenwich Village in 1951, under the direction of its dean, Arthur T. Vanderbilt. That year, it also established the Root-Tilden-Kern Scholarship for public service.[10]\n\nAcademics[edit]\nNew York University School of Law, Vanderbilt Hall\nNYU Law publishes ten student-edited law journals. The journals appear below in the order of their founding:\n\nMoot Court Board (which is considered a journal at NYU Law)[15]\nNew York University Law Review\nNYU Annual Survey of American Law\nNYU Journal of International Law and Politics\nReview of Law & Social Change\nNew York University Environmental Law Journal\nJournal of Legislation & Public Policy\nJournal of Law & Business\nJournal of Law & Liberty\nJournal of Intellectual Property & Entertainment Law\nNYU Law also publishes three faculty-edited law journals:\n\nClinical Law Review\nThe International Journal of Constitutional Law (I\u00b7CON)\nTax Law Review\nThe law school's Root-Tilden-Kern Scholarship Program is a full-tuition scholarship awarded each year to twenty students committed to public service.\nNYU Law offers several fellowships to students admitted to the LLM Program.[16] The Hauser Global Scholarship admits eight to ten top LLM students from all over the world. The scholarship includes full tuition waiver and reasonable accommodation costs. In addition, it offers the Hugo Grotius as well as Vanderbilt scholarships for International law studies and other branches of law respectively.[17]\nThe school has a law and business program in which eight student-leaders in law and business are awarded fellowships in the Mitchell Jacobson Leadership Program.[18] In addition, the NYU Center for Law, Economics and Organization administers the Lawrence Lederman Fellowship to facilitate the study of Law & Economics the program provides a $5,000 scholarship to selected students to work closely with NYU Law faculty and participate in a series of collaborative workshops designed to help students write a substantial research paper.[19]\nNYU Law also hosts the original chapter of the Unemployment Action Center.\n\nLL.M. in Taxation Program[edit]\nNYU Law School's LL.M. programs in Taxation and in International Taxation have been consistently ranked first by the U.S. News & World Report magazine since they started ranking specialty law school programs in 1992.[20][21] Brant Hellwig is currently the faculty director of the program.[22]\nTax LL.M. students are permitted to enroll in a general course of study or specialize in specific areas such as business taxation or estate planning.[23] Many of the program's professors are practitioners in their respective fields.[24]\n\nMaster of Science (M.S.) in Cybersecurity Risk & Strategy[edit]\nThe MS in Cybersecurity Risk and Strategy[25] is a one-year program offered jointly by NYU School of Law and NYU Tandon School of Engineering. The program is intended for mid-to-senior level professionals, and cohorts have historically been diverse,[26] professionally and academically. Faculty directors include: Nasir Memon, Randy Milch, and Sam Rascoff. Other notable faculty[27] include: Ed Amoroso, Judi Germano, Zach Goldman, Ira Rubinstein, Rob Silvers, and Chris Sprigman.\n\nPartnerships[edit]\nMore recently, the NYU School of Law has entered into dual degree agreements with the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law and the University of Melbourne Law School.\nOxford University has a program of academic exchanges with New York University School of Law, mainly involving faculty members and research students working in areas of shared interest.[28]\nNYU Law offers a dual-degree program with Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Students may earn a JD/MPA or a JD/MPP.[29]\nNYU Law offers a dual-degree program with the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. Students may earn a JD/MPA.[30]\nThere is also an exchange program between Columbia Law School and NYU School of Law which allows a limited number of JD and LL.M. students to take courses at each other's schools.[31] Columbia Law and NYU Law also play a basketball game every spring, the Deans' Cup, to raise money for their public interest and community service organizations. NYU Law has taken home the Deans' Cup for the last three tournaments.[32]\n\nCareer planning[edit]\nGraduates of the law school routinely obtain employment in elite public and private-sector positions.[33]\nAccording to New York University School of Law's 2013 ABA-required disclosures, 93.7 percent of the Class of 2013 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.[34]\n\nAdmissions[edit]\nMore than 11,000 applicants competed for about 480 seats in the 2021 entering class at NYU Law.[35] The 2010 edition of University of Chicago Professor Brian Leiter's ranking of the top law schools by student quality placed NYU Law 4th out of the 144 accredited schools in the United States.[36]\nAdmission to the New York University School of Law is highly competitive. The 25th and 75th LSAT percentiles for the 2021 entering class were 170 and 174, respectively, with a median of 172. The 25th and 75th undergraduate GPA percentiles were 3.73 and 3.93, respectively, with a median of 3.86.[37]\n\nFacilities[edit]\nTwo of NYU Law's buildingsFurman HallHayden Hall\nNYU Law School facilities at the school's Washington Square Campus include:\n\nVanderbilt Hall[edit]\nThe law school's main building, named after Arthur T. Vanderbilt, occupies the entire block between West Third and Washington Square South (West Fourth) and between Macdougal and Sullivan Streets. Part of the first floor as well as the underground floors host the library, which it shares with Furman Hall. The first floor also holds the auditorium, student center, and main banquet hall. The second floor is mostly classrooms, while the third and fourth floors are mostly faculty and dean offices.[38]\n\nFurman Hall[edit]\nLocated on West 3rd Street between Sullivan and Thompson Streets, and on Sullivan and Thompson Streets between West 3rd and West 4th Streets,  Furman Hall opened on January 22, 2004, and is named for alumnus and donor Jay Furman. It connects to Vanderbilt Hall through the law library, part of which is underneath Sullivan Street. The underground level also hosts the Lawyering faculty. Floors one-three have classrooms, lounges, and study space. The fourth floor hosts the career counseling program, and the fifth and sixth floors house the legal practice clinics. The highest floors, generally inaccessible to non-residents, are apartments for faculty and their families. The ninth floor is accessible to students and hosts the Lester Pollack Colloquium room.\nThe building's West 3rd Street facade incorporates the remaining part of the facade of a townhouse that Edgar Allan Poe lived in from 1844 to 1846, near the site where the house originally stood, the result of a settlement between NYU and preservationists who objected to the university's 2000 plan to tear down the building, which had already lost two stories from the time that Poe dwelled there.[39]\n\nHayden Residence Hall[edit]\nLocated at 240 Mercer Street, on the southern side of West Third street, adjacent to Broadway, and a couple of blocks east of D'Agostino Hall, Wilf Hall, Furman Hall and Vanderbilt Hall, Hayden Hall houses approximately 500 Law students and faculty. The basement is home to \"Mercer Pub\" (a room with couches, tables, and a small kitchen that can also be reserved by student groups for social events) and several student run organizations. Hayden is available for summer housing for non-NYU Law students through its Summer Living in New York program.\n\nD'Agostino Residence Hall[edit]\nLocated at the intersection of West Third Street and MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village, D'Agostino Residence Hall houses approximately 300 law students and faculty.[citation needed] It is across the street from the rear of the main law school building, Vanderbilt Hall, and less than 1 block from Wilf Hall and Furman Hall.[40]\nElevators to the apartments are on the highest level, the Front Desk is on the street level, and The Commons (residents' lounge with computers and printers) is on the lower level.  One floor beneath The Commons is the sub-basement, home to most of NYU's legal journals. The second (above-ground) floor, houses numerous administrative offices (Development, Alumni Relations, Special Events, Communications, Human Resources and Financial Services).  Two large function rooms - Lipton Hall and the Faculty Club - are also located in the building.[41]\nThe law building is named after Filomen D'Agostino, one of the first woman lawyers, who graduated in 1920.  Later in life, Ms. D'Agostino donated $4 million to support residential scholarship and faculty research; the school responded by naming their new apartment building after her.[42]\nD'Agostino Hall is also available for summer housing for non-NYU Law students through its Summer Living in New York program.\n\n22 Washington Square North[edit]\n22 Washington Square North, located in a historic 1830s townhouse on the north side of Washington Square Park in \"The Row\", houses the Straus Institute for the Advanced Study of Law & Justice, the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law & Justice, and the Tikvah Center for Law & Jewish Civilization.  This building was renovated in 2009 by Morris Adjmi Architects, has a green wall, and should meet silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards.\n\nWilf Hall[edit]\nWilf Hall, at 139 Macdougal Street, houses approximately a dozen of the schools centers, programs and institutes as well as the admissions offices (Graduate and JD).  Per the NYU Law Magazine, it is a \"campus destination for faculty, students, and research scholars from an array of disciplines to exchange ideas and, through their work, shape the public discourse around the leading social and political issues of the day.\"\nWilf Hall also contains the Provincetown Playhouse.  The playhouse opened in the 1920s and premiered many Eugene O'Neil plays.  The theatre is run by NYU's Steinhardt School of Education.

Weiler.[66]\nThe Tikvah Center for Law & Jewish Civilization is headed by Moshe Halbertal and Joseph H. H. Weiler. The foundational premise of the center is 1) that the study of Jewish law can profit immensely from insights gained from general jurisprudence; and 2) that Jewish law and Jewish civilization can provide illuminating perspectives both on the general study of law as a per se academic discipline, and on the reflection of law as a central social institution refracting the most important issues in our society.[67]\nThe U.S.-Asia Law Institute serves as a resource and partner to various Asian countries as they reform and further develop their legal systems and institutions.

She was a Congressional Correspondent, as well as the National Political Correspondent based in Washington D.C. for the magazine.[3]\n\n\nLife[edit]\nTumulty graduated from David Crockett High School in Austin, Texas in May 1973. She later graduated in 1977 from the University of Texas at Austin with a BA in Journalism with high honors; she is an alumna of the Alpha Xi Delta sorority. She wrote for The Daily Texan student newspaper.[4] She received an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1981.[5] Tumulty is married to Paul Richter and has two sons, Nicholas and Jack.[6] She is Catholic.[7]\n\nCareer[edit]\nTumulty began her career in 1977 at the now-defunct San Antonio Light. Tumulty spent 14 years with the Los Angeles Times, covering the US Congress, economics, business, energy, and general-assignment beats. While at the Times, she won the Gerald Loeb Award for distinguished business and financial journalism in 1982 for Large Newspapers,[8] and the National Press Foundation's Edwin Hood Award for diplomatic correspondence in 1993.[5]\nTumulty joined Time in 1994. She covered Congress for two years, during which time she reported and wrote the magazine's 1995 \"Man of the Year\" profile of Newt Gingrich.[5] In 1996, she became a White House Correspondent, writing major stories on President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. She became the National Political Correspondent in 2001.\nIn the 2008 presidential campaign, Tumulty accused the campaign of Senator John McCain of \"playing the race card\" for a television ad criticizing the connections between Senator Barack Obama and Franklin Raines, the former CEO of Fannie Mae. Tumulty wrote that the ad displayed \"sinister images of two black men, followed by one of a vulnerable-looking elderly white woman.\"[9] The McCain campaign pointed out that they had also produced an ad criticizing the connections of Barack Obama to Jim Johnson, another former Fannie Mae CEO who is white. According to the McCain campaign, Tumulty did not correct her post, but responded with \"I grew up in Texas. I know what this stuff looks like.\" The McCain campaign accused Tumulty of \"hysterical liberal bias.\"[10]\nIn 2010, Tumulty joined The Washington Post, where she received the 2013 Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting.[6] She became a political columnist in 2018.[11] In 2021, she was named deputy editorial page editor.[12]\nTumulty's coverage of health care reform issues has been informed by her personal experience with her brother Patrick's health problems.[13][14]\nBesides her work in print journalism, she has appeared as a television/webcasting news analyst on the public affairs programs Washington Week on PBS,[15] PBS NewsHour,[16] and Special Report with Bret Baier on Fox News (as part of the 'All-Star Panel').[17]\nAdmiral William H. McRaven, her fifth grade classmate and commander of USSOCOM, was her guest at the 2012 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner.[18] Adm. McRaven commanded JSOC when it planned and carried out Operation Neptune Spear, the U.S. Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nSee also[edit]\nFox 'All-Star Panel' members\nWashington Week panelists\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Tumulty, Karen [@@ktumulty] (December  2, 2013). \"Thanks, tweeps, for all the lovely birthday...\" (Tweet).

He was Senior Advisor and Deputy Chief of Staff during the George W. Bush administration until his resignation on August 31, 2007. He has also headed the Office of Political Affairs, the Office of Public Liaison, and the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives.\nPrior to his White House appointments, he is credited with the 1994 and 1998 Texas gubernatorial victories of George W. Bush, as well as Bush's 2000 and 2004 successful presidential campaigns. In his 2004 victory speech, Bush referred to Rove as \"the Architect\". Rove has also been credited for the successful campaigns of John Ashcroft (1994 U.S. Senate election), Bill Clements (1986 Texas gubernatorial election), Senator John Cornyn (2002 U.S. Senate election), Governor Rick Perry (1990 Texas Agriculture Commission election), and Phil Gramm (1982 U.S. House and 1984 U.S. Senate elections). Since leaving the White House, Rove has worked as a political analyst and contributor for Fox News, Newsweek, and The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\nEarly years[edit]\nFamily, upbringing, and early education[edit]\nRove was born on Christmas Day in Denver, Colorado, the second of five children, and was raised in Sparks, Nevada. His parents separated when he was 19 years old[1] and the man whom Rove knew as his father was a geologist.[2]\nIn 1965, his family moved to Salt Lake City, where Rove entered high school, becoming a skilled debater.[3] Encouraged by a teacher to run for class senate, Rove won the election. As part of his campaign strategy he rode in the back of a convertible inside the school gymnasium sitting between two attractive girls before his election speech.[4] While at Olympus High School,[5] he was elected student council president his junior and senior years. Rove was also a Teenage Republican and served as Chairman of the Utah Federation of Teenage Republicans. During this time, his father got a job in Los Angeles and visited the family during holidays.[6]\nRove's mother suffered from depression and had contemplated suicide more than once in her life.[6] Rove has stated that although he loved his mother, she was seriously flawed, undependable and, at times, unstable.[6] In December 1969, after a heated fight with his wife, the man Rove had known as his father left the family and divorced Rove's mother soon afterwards.[7][8] Rove's mother moved back to Nevada, and his siblings briefly lived with relatives after the divorce.[6] Rove learned from his aunt and uncle that the man who had raised him was not his biological father; both he and his older brother Eric were the children of another man. Rove has expressed great love and admiration for his adoptive father and for \"how selfless\" his love had been.[9] Rove's father and mother expressed deep regret over the failure of the marriage and briefly tried dating each other after the divorce, but they refused to explain the breakup of the marriage, only stating that they still \"loved each other dearly.\"[6] Rove was unable to convince his parents to get back together, as they were adamant about the divorce, a situation which Rove still does not understand.[6] Rove's relationship with his adoptive father was briefly strained for a few months following the divorce, but they maintained a very close relationship for the rest of his life.[10]\nRove had only infrequent contact with his mother in the 1970s. She frequently withheld child support checks and spent them for herself. She and her second husband lost most of their money due to poor financial decisions on her part and his gambling and overspending.[11] On September 11, 1981, Rove's mother died by suicide north of Reno, Nevada, shortly after she decided to divorce her third and final husband, to whom she had been unhappily married for only three months.[10][12]\n\nEntry into politics[edit]\nRove began his involvement in American politics in 1968. In a 2002 Deseret News interview, Rove explained, \"I was the Olympus High chairman for (former U.S. Sen.) Wallace F. Bennett's re-election campaign, where he was opposed by the dynamic, young, aggressive political science professor at the University of Utah, J.D. Williams.\"[13] Bennett was reelected to a third six-year term in November 1968. Through Rove's campaign involvement, Bennett's son, Robert \"Bob\" Foster Bennett\u2014a future United States Senator from Utah\u2014would become a friend. Williams would later become a mentor to Rove.\n\nCollege and the Dixon campaign sabotage incident[edit]\nIn the fall of 1969, Rove entered the University of Utah, on a $1,000 scholarship,[14] as a political science major and joined the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Through the University's Hinckley Institute of Politics, he got an internship with the Utah Republican Party. That position, and contacts from the 1968 Bennett campaign, helped him secure a job in 1970 on Ralph Tyler Smith's unsuccessful re-election campaign for Senate from Illinois against Democrat Adlai E. Stevenson III.\nIn the fall of 1970, Rove used a false identity to enter the campaign office of Democrat Alan J. Dixon, who was running for Treasurer of Illinois. He stole 1000 sheets of paper with campaign letterhead, printed fake campaign rally fliers promising \"free beer, free food, girls and a good time for nothing\", and distributed them at rock concerts and homeless shelters, with the effect of disrupting Dixon's rally. (Dixon eventually won the election.) Rove's role would not become publicly known until August 1973 when Rove told The Dallas Morning News. In 1999 he said, \"It was a youthful prank at the age of 19 and I regret it.\"[15] In his memoir, Rove wrote that when he was later nominated to the Board for International Broadcasting by President George H.W. Bush, Senator Dixon did not kill his nomination. In Rove's account, \"Dixon displayed more grace than I had shown and kindly excused this youthful prank.\"[16]\n\nCollege Republicans, Watergate, and the Bushes[edit]\nIn June 1971, after the end of the semester, Rove dropped out of the University of Utah to take a paid position as the Executive Director of the College Republican National Committee.[17] Joe Abate, who was National Chairman of the College Republicans at the time, became his mentor.[9] Rove then enrolled at the University of Maryland in College Park in the Fall of 1971, but withdrew from classes during the first half of the semester.[18] In July 1999 he told The Washington Post that he did not have a degree because \"I lack at this point one math class, which I can take by exam, and my foreign language requirement.\"[15]\nRove traveled extensively, participating as an instructor at weekend seminars for campus conservatives across the country. He was an active participant in Richard Nixon's 1972 Presidential campaign. A CBS report on the organization of the Nixon campaign from June 1972 includes an interview with a young Rove working for the College Republican National Committee.[19]\nRove held the position of executive director of the College Republicans until early 1973. He left the job to spend five months, without pay, campaigning full-time for the position of National Chairman during the time he attended George Mason University.[9] Lee Atwater, the group's Southern regional coordinator, who was two months younger than Rove, assisted with Rove's campaign. His campaign was managed by Daniel Mintz, of the Maryland College Republicans.[20] Karl spent the spring of 1973 crisscrossing the country in a Ford Pinto, lining up the support of Republican state chairs.\nThe College Republicans summer 1973 convention at the Lake of the Ozarks resort in Missouri was quite contentious. Rove's opponent was Robert Edgeworth of Michigan. The other major candidate, Terry Dolan of California, dropped out, supporting Edgeworth. A number of states had sent two competing delegates, because Rove and his supporters had made credential challenges at state and regional conventions. For example, after the Midwest regional convention, Rove forces had produced a version of the Midwestern College Republicans constitution which differed significantly from the constitution that the Edgeworth forces were using, in order to justify the unseating of the Edgeworth delegates on procedural grounds,[9] including delegations, such as Ohio and Missouri, which had been certified earlier by Rove himself. In the end, there were two votes, conducted by two convention chairs, and two winners\u2014Rove and Edgeworth, each of whom delivered an acceptance speech. After the convention, both Edgeworth and Rove appealed to Republican National Committee Chairman George H. W. Bush, each contending that he was the new College Republican chairman.\nWhile resolution was pending, Dolan went (anonymously) to The Washington Post with recordings of several training seminars for young Republicans where a co-presenter of Rove's, Bernie Robinson, cautioned against doing the same thing he had done: rooting through opponents' garbage cans. The tape with this story on it, as well as Rove's admonition not to copy similar tricks as Rove's against Dixon, was secretly recorded and edited by Rich Evans, who had hoped to receive an appointment from Rove's competitor in the CRNC chairmanship race.[21] On August 10, 1973, in the midst of the Watergate scandal, the Post broke the story in an article titled \"GOP Party Probes Official as Teacher of Tricks\".[22]\nIn response, then RNC Chairman George H.W. Bush, had an FBI agent question Rove. As part of the investigation, Atwater signed an affidavit, dated August 13, 1973, stating that he had heard a \"20 minute anecdote similar to the one described in The Washington Post\" in July 1972, but that \"it was a funny story during a coffee break\".[23] Former Nixon White House Counsel John Dean, has been quoted as saying \"based on my review of the files, it appears the Watergate prosecutors were interested in Rove's activities in 1972, but because they had bigger fish to fry they did not aggressively investigate him.\"[24]\nOn September 6, 1973, three weeks after announcing his intent to investigate the allegations against Rove, George H. W. Bush chose him to be chairman of the College Republicans. Bush then wrote Edgeworth a letter saying that he had concluded that Rove had fairly won the vote at the convention. Edgeworth wrote back, asking about the basis of that conclusion. Not long after that, Edgeworth stated \"Bush sent me back the angriest letter I have ever received in my life. I had leaked to The Washington Post, and now I was out of the Party forever.\"\nAs National Chairman, Rove introduced Bush to Atwater, who had taken Rove's job as the College Republican's executive director, and who would become Bush's main campaign strategist in future years. Bush hired Rove as a Special Assistant in the Republican National Committee, a job Rove left in 1974 to become Executive Assistant to the co-chair of the RNC, Richard D. Obenshain.\nAs Special Assistant, Rove performed small personal tasks for Bush. In November 1973, he asked Rove to take a set of car keys to his son George W. Bush, who was visiting home during a break from Harvard Business School. It was the first time the two met. \"Huge amounts of charisma, swagger, cowboy boots, flight jacket, wonderful smile, just charisma \u2013 you know, wow\", Rove recalled years later.[22]\n\nVirginia[edit]\nIn 1976, Rove left D.C. to work in Virginian politics. Initially, Rove served as the Finance Director for the Republican Party of Virginia. Rove describes this as the role in which he discovered his love for direct mail campaigns.[10]\n\nThe Texas years and notable political campaigns[edit]\n1977\u20131991[edit]\nRove's initial job in Texas was in 1977 as a legislative aide for Fred Agnich, a Texas Republican state representative from Dallas.[25] Later that same year, Rove got a job as executive director of the Fund for Limited Government, a political action committee (PAC) in Houston headed by James A. Baker, III, a Houston lawyer (later President George H. W. Bush's Secretary of State). The PAC eventually became the genesis of the Bush-for-President campaign of 1979\u20131980.\nHis work for Bill Clements during the Texas gubernatorial election of 1978 helped Clements become the first Republican Governor of Texas in over 100 years. Clements was elected to a four-year term, succeeding Democrat Dolph Briscoe. Rove was deputy director of the Governor William P. Clements Junior Committee in 1979 and 1980, and deputy executive assistant to the governor of Texas (roughly, Deputy Chief of Staff) in 1980 and 1981.[26]\nIn 1981, Rove founded a direct mail consulting firm, Karl Rove & Co., in Austin. The firm's first clients included Texas Governor Bill Clements and Democratic congressman Phil Gramm, who later became a Republican congressman and United States Senator. Rove operated his consulting business until 1999, when he sold the firm to take a full-time position in George W. Bush's presidential campaign.\nBetween 1981 and 1999, Rove worked on hundreds of races. Most were in a supporting role, doing direct mail fundraising. A November 2004 Atlantic Monthly article estimated that he was the primary strategist for 41 statewide, congressional, and national races, and Rove's candidates won 34 races.[27]\nRove also did work during those years for non-political clients. From 1991 to 1996, Rove advised tobacco giant Philip Morris, and ultimately earned $3,000 a month via a consulting contract. In a deposition, Rove testified that he severed the tie in 1996 because he felt awkward \"about balancing that responsibility with his role as Bush's top political advisor\" while Bush was governor of Texas and Texas was suing the tobacco industry.[28][citation needed]\n\n1978 George W. Bush congressional campaign[edit]\nRove advised the younger Bush during his unsuccessful Texas congressional campaign in 1978.\n\n1980 George H. W. Bush presidential campaign[edit]\nIn 1977, Rove was the first person hired by George H. W. Bush for his unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign, which ended with Bush as the vice-presidential nominee.\n\n1982 William Clements, Jr. gubernatorial campaign[edit]\nIn 1982, Rove returned to assisting Governor Bill Clements in his run  for reelection, but was defeated by Democrat Mark White.\n\n1982 Phil Gramm congressional campaign[edit]\nIn 1982, Phil Gramm was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a conservative Texas Democrat.\n\n1984 Phil Gramm senatorial campaign[edit]\nIn 1984, Rove helped Gramm, who had become a Republican in 1983, defeat Republican Ron Paul in the primary and Democrat Lloyd Doggett in the race for U.S. Senate.\n\n1984 Ronald Reagan presidential campaign[edit]\nRove handled direct-mail for the Reagan-Bush campaign.\n\n1986 William Clements, Jr. gubernatorial campaign[edit]\nIn 1986, Rove helped Clements become governor a second time. In a strategy memo Rove wrote for his client prior to the race, now among Clements' papers in the Texas A&M University library, Rove quoted Napoleon: \"The whole art of war consists in a well-reasoned and extremely circumspect defensive, followed by rapid and audacious attack.\"\nIn 1986, just before a crucial debate in the campaign, Rove claimed that his office had been bugged by Democrats. The police and FBI investigated and discovered that the bug's battery was so small that it needed to be changed every few hours, and the investigation was dropped.[29] Critics, including other Republican operatives, suspected Rove had bugged his own office to garner sympathy votes in the close governor's race.[30]\n\n1988 Texas Supreme Court races[edit]\nIn 1988, Rove helped Thomas R. Phillips become the first Republican elected as Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court. Phillips had been appointed to the position in November 1987 by Clements. Phillips was re-elected in 1990, 1996 and 2002.[citation needed]\nPhillips' election in 1988 was part of an aggressive grassroots campaign called \"Clean Slate '88\", a conservative effort that was successful in getting five of its six candidates elected. (Ordinarily there were three justices on the ballot each year, on a nine-justice court, but, because of resignations, there were six races for the Supreme Court on the ballot in November 1988.) By 1998, Republicans held all nine seats on the Court.\n\n1990 Texas gubernatorial campaign[edit]\nIn 1989, Rove encouraged George W. Bush to run for Texas governor, brought in experts to tutor him on policy, and introduced him to local reporters. Eventually, Bush decided not to run, and Rove backed another Republican for governor who lost in the primary.\n\nOther 1990 Texas statewide races[edit]\nIn 1990, two other Rove candidates won: Rick Perry, the future governor of the state, became agricultural commissioner, and Kay Bailey Hutchison became state treasurer.\nOne notable aspect of the 1990 election was the charge that Rove had asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate major Democratic officeholders in Texas. In his 2010 autobiography, Rove called the whole thing a \"myth\", saying:\n\nThe FBI did investigate Texas officials during that span, but I had nothing to do with it. The investigation was called \"Brilab\" and was part of a broad anti-corruption probe that looked at officials in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., as well as Texas\u00a0... An official for the U.S. Department of Agriculture spotted expenses claimed by Hightower's shop that raised red flags\u00a0... enough to indict some of Hightower's top aides; they were later found guilty and sent to prison.\u00a0... The myth that I had something to do both with spurring the investigation and with airing all of this has stuck around because it is convenient for some to blame me rather than those aides who ran afoul of the law.[31]\n1991 Richard L. Thornburgh senatorial campaign and lawsuit[edit]\nIn 1991, United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh resigned to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, one made vacant by John Heinz's death in a helicopter crash. Rove's company worked for the campaign, but it ended with an upset loss to Democrat Harris Wofford.\nRover had been hired by an intermediary Murray Dickman to work for Thornburgh's campaign. Subsequently, Rove sued Thornburgh directly, alleging non-payment for services rendered. The Republican National Committee, worried that the suit would make it hard to recruit good candidates, urged Rove to back off. When Rove refused, the RNC hired Kenneth Starr to write an amicus brief on Thornburgh's behalf. Karl Rove & Co. v. Thornburgh was heard by U.S. Federal Judge Sam Sparks, who had been appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1991. After a trial in Austin, Rove prevailed.[9]\n\n1992 George H. W. Bush presidential campaign[edit]\nRove was fired from the 1992 Bush presidential campaign after he planted a negative story with columnist Robert Novak about dissatisfaction with campaign fundraising chief Robert Mosbacher Jr.[32] Novak's column suggested a motive when it described the firing of Mosbacher by former Senator Phil Gramm: \"Also attending the session was political consultant Karl Rove, who had been shoved aside by Mosbacher.\" Novak and Rove denied that Rove leaked, but Mosbacher maintained that \"Rove is the only one with a motive to leak this. We let him go. I still believe he did it.\"[33]\nDuring testimony before the CIA leak grand jury, Rove apparently confirmed his prior involvement with Novak in the 1992 campaign leak, according to National Journal reporter Murray Waas.[34]\n\n1993\u20132000[edit]\n1993 Kay Bailey Hutchison senatorial campaign\nRove helped Hutchison win a special Senate election in June 1993. Hutchison defeated Democrat Bob Krueger to fill the last two years of Lloyd Bentsen's term. Bentsen had resigned to become Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration.\n1994 Alabama Supreme Court races\nIn 1994, a group called the Business Council of Alabama hired Rove to help run a slate of Republican candidates for the state supreme court. No Republican had been elected to that court in more than a century. The campaign by the Republicans was unprecedented in the state, which had previously only seen low-key contests. After the election, a court battle over absentee and other ballots followed that lasted more than 11 months. It ended when a federal appeals court judge ruled that disputed absentee ballots could not be counted, and ordered the Alabama Secretary of State to certify the Republican candidate for Chief Justice, Perry Hooper, as the winner. An appeal to the Supreme Court by the Democratic candidate was turned down within a few days, making the ruling final. Hooper won by 262 votes.\nAnother candidate, Harold See, ran against Mark Kennedy, an incumbent Democratic justice and the son-in-law of George Wallace. The race included charges that Kennedy was mingling campaign funds with those of a non-profit children's foundation he was involved with. A former Rove staffer reported that some within the See camp initiated a whisper campaign that Kennedy was a pedophile.[27] Kennedy won by less than one percentage point.\n1994 John Ashcroft senatorial campaign\nIn 1993, Karl Rove & Company was paid $300,000 in consulting fees by Ashcroft's successful 1994 Senate campaign.[35] Ashcroft paid Rove's company more than $700,000 over the course of three campaigns.\n1994 George W. Bush gubernatorial campaign\nIn 1993, Rove began advising George W. Bush in his successful campaign to become governor of Texas. Bush announced his candidacy in November 1993. By January 1994, Bush had spent more than $600,000 on the race against incumbent Democrat Ann Richards, with $340,000 of that paid to Rove's firm.\nRove has been accused of using the push poll technique to call voters to ask such things as whether people would be \"more or less likely to vote for Governor Richards if [they] knew her staff is dominated by lesbians\". Rove has denied having been involved in circulating these rumors about Richards during the campaign,[36] although many critics nonetheless identify this technique, particularly as used in this instance against Richards, as a hallmark of his career.[37][38][39]\n1996 Harold See's campaign for Associate Justice, Alabama Supreme Court\nA former campaign worker charged that, at Rove's behest, he distributed flyers that anonymously attacked Harold See, their own client. This put the opponent's campaign in an awkward position; public denials of responsibility for the scurrilous flyers would be implausible. Rove's client was elected.[citation needed]\n1998 George W. Bush gubernatorial campaign\nRove was an adviser for Bush's 1998 reelection campaign. From July through December 1998, Bush's reelection committee paid Rove & Co. nearly $2.5 million, and also paid the Rove-owned Praxis List Company $267,000 for use of mailing lists. Rove says his work for the Bush campaign included direct mail, voter contact, phone banks, computer services, and travel expenses. Of the $2.5 million, Rove said, \"[a]bout 30 percent of that is postage\". In all, Bush (primarily through Rove's efforts) raised $17.7 million, with $3.4 million unspent as of March 1999.[40] During the course of this campaign Rove's much-reported feud with Rick Perry began, with Perry's strategists believing Rove gave Perry bad advice in order to help Bush get a larger share of the Hispanic vote.[41]\n2000 Harold See campaign for Chief Justice\nFor the race to succeed Perry Hooper, who was retiring as Alabama's chief justice, Rove lined up support for See from a majority of the state's important Republicans.[27]\n\n2000 George W. Bush presidential campaign and the sale of Karl Rove & Co.[edit]\nSee also: George W. Bush 2000 presidential campaign\nIn early 1999, Rove sold his 20-year-old direct-mail business, Karl Rove & Co., which provided campaign services to candidates, along with Praxis List Company (in whole or part) to Ted Delisi and Todd Olsen, two young political operatives who had worked on campaigns of some other Rove candidates. Rove helped finance the sale of the company, which had 11 employees. Selling Karl Rove & Co. was a condition that George W. Bush had insisted on before Rove took the job of chief strategist for Bush's presidential bid.[28]\nDuring the Republican primary, Rove was accused of spreading false rumors that John McCain had fathered an illegitimate black child. Rove denies the accusation.[42]\n\nGeorge W. Bush administration[edit]\nRove with George W. and Laura Bush\nWhen George W. Bush was first inaugurated in January 2001, Rove accepted an appointment as Senior Advisor. He was later given the title Deputy Chief of Staff to the President after the successful 2004 Presidential election. In a November 2004 speech, Bush publicly thanked Rove, calling him \"the architect\" of his victory over John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election.[43] In April 2006, Rove was reassigned from his policy development role to one focusing on strategic and tactical planning in anticipation of the November 2006 congressional elections.[44]\n\nIraq War[edit]\nRove played a leading role in the lead-up to the Iraq War.[45][46] In 2002 and 2003, Rove chaired meetings of the White House Iraq Group (WHIG), an internal White House working group established in August 2002, eight months prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. WHIG was charged with developing a strategy \"for publicizing the White House's assertion that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the United States.\".[47] The group pushed narratives within the administration about the Hussein regime possessing weapons of mass destruction (the regime had no active WMD program) and its ties to international terrorism (the Hussein regime had no operational relationship with al-Qaeda).[46] Members of WHIG included Bush's Chief of Staff Andrew Card, national security advisor Condoleezza Rice, her deputy Stephen Hadley, Vice President Dick Cheney's Chief of Staff Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, legislative liaison Nicholas E. Calio, and communication strategists Mary Matalin, Karen Hughes, and James R. Wilkinson.\nQuoting one unnamed WHIG member, The Washington Post explained that the task force's mission was to \"educate the public\" about the threat posed by Saddam and (in the reporters' words) \"[to] set strategy for each stage of the confrontation with Baghdad\". Rove's \"strategic communications\" task force within WHIG helped write and coordinate speeches by senior Bush administration officials, emphasizing Iraq's purported nuclear threat.[48] The White House Iraq Group was \"little known\" until a subpoena for its notes, email, and attendance records was issued by CIA leak investigator Patrick Fitzgerald in January 2004.[47][49]\nIn 2015, Rove defended the decision to invade Iraq, telling an Iraq War veteran that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the United States.[50][51] In 2010, Rove said his biggest mistake regarding the Iraq War was to not push back on the narrative that the Bush administration lied the U.S. into the Iraq War.[52][42][53]\n\nValerie Plame affair[edit]\nOn August 29, 2003, retired ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV claimed that Rove leaked the identity of Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, as a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee,[54] in retaliation for Wilson's op-ed in The New York Times in which he criticized the Bush administration's citation of the yellowcake documents among the justifications for the War in Iraq enumerated in Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address.\nIn late August 2006, it became known that Richard L. Armitage was responsible for the leak. The investigation led to felony charges being filed against Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby for perjury and obstruction of justice. Eventually, Libby was found guilty by a jury.[55]\nOn June 13, 2006, prosecutors said they would not charge Rove with any wrongdoing.[56] Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald stated previously that \"I can tell you that the substantial bulk of the work of this investigation is concluded.\"\nOn July 13, 2006, Plame sued Cheney, Rove, Libby, and others, accusing them of conspiring to destroy her career.[57]\nOn May 2, 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to Attorney General Gonzales compelling the Department of Justice to produce all email from Rove regarding the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, no matter what email account Rove may have used, with a deadline of May 15, 2007, for compliance. The subpoena also demanded relevant email previously produced in the Valerie Plame controversy and the investigation regarding the CIA leak scandal (2003).[58] On August 31, 2007, Karl Rove resigned without responding to the Senate Judiciary Committee subpoena, saying, \"I just think it's time to leave.\"[59][60][61]\nScott McClellan claims in his book What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception, published in the spring of 2008 by Public Affairs Books, that the statements he made in 2003 about Rove's lack of involvement in the Valerie Plame affair were untrue, and that he had been encouraged to repeat such untruths. His book has been widely disputed, however, with many key members of McClellan's own staff telling a completely different story. Former CNN commentator Robert Novak has questioned if McClelland wrote the book himself. It was also revealed that the publisher was seeking a negative book to increase sales.[62][63]\n\n2006 Congressional elections and beyond[edit]\nOn October 24, 2006, two weeks before the Congressional election, in an interview with National Public Radio's Robert Siegel, Rove insisted that his insider polling data forecast Republican retention of both houses.[64] In the election the Democrats won both houses of Congress. The White House Bulletin, published by Bulletin News, cited rumors of Rove's impending departure from the White House staff: \"'Karl represents the old style and he's got to go if the Democrats are going to believe Bush's talk of getting along', said a key Bush advisor.\"[65] However, while allowing that many Republican members of Congress are \"resentful of the way he and the White House conducted the losing campaign\", The New York Times also stated that, \"White House officials say President Bush has every intention of keeping Mr. Rove on through the rest of his term.\"[66]\nIn Rove's analysis, 10 of the 28 House seats Republicans lost were sacrificed because of various scandals. Another six, he said, were lost because incumbents did not recognize and react quickly enough to the threat. Rove argued that, without corruption and complacency, the Democrats would have gained around a dozen seats and Republicans could have kept narrow control of the House regardless of Bush's troubles and the war.[67][68]\n\nTorture[edit]\nRove defended the Bush administration's use of waterboarding, a form of torture.[53]\n\nE-mail scandal[edit]\nMain article: Bush White House e-mail controversy\nDue to investigations into White House staffers' e-mail communication related to the controversy over the dismissal of United States Attorneys, it was discovered that many White House staff members, including Rove, had exchanged documents using Republican National Committee e-mail servers such as gwb43.com[69] and georgewbush.com[70] or personal e-mail accounts with third party providers such as BlackBerry,[71] considered a violation of the Presidential Records Act. Over 500 of Rove's emails were mistakenly sent to a parody website, who forwarded them to an investigative reporter.[72]\n\nCongressional subpoenas[edit]\nOn May 22, 2008, Rove was subpoenaed by House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers to testify on the politicization of the Department of Justice. But on July 10, Rove refused to obey the congressional subpoena, citing executive privilege as his reason.[73][74]\nOn February 23, 2009, Rove was required by Congressional subpoena to testify before the House Judiciary Committee concerning his knowledge of the controversy over the dismissal of seven U.S. Attorneys, and the alleged political prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman, but did not appear on that date. He and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers later agreed to testify under oath before Congress about these matters.[75]\nOn July 7 and July 30, 2009, Rove testified before the House Judiciary Committee regarding questions about the dismissal of seven U.S. Attorneys under the Bush Administration. Rove was also questioned regarding the federal prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman, who was convicted of fraud. The Committee concluded that Rove had played a significant role in the Attorney firings.[citation needed]\n\nActivities after leaving the White House[edit]\nActivities in 2008[edit]\nShortly after leaving the White House, Rove was hired to write about the 2008 Presidential Election for Newsweek.[76] He was also later hired as a contributor for The Wall Street Journal and a political analyst for Fox News. Rove was an informal advisor to 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain, and donated $2,300 to his campaign.[77] His memoir, Courage and Consequence, was published in March 2010.[31][78] One advance reviewer, Dana Milbank of The Washington Post, said of the book that Rove \"revives claims discredited long ago\".[79] The controversial book inspired a grassroots rock and roll compilation of a similar name, Courage and Consequence,[80] that was released a week before the memoir.\nOn March 9, 2008, Rove appeared at the University of Iowa as a paid speaker to a crowd of approximately 1,000. He was met with hostility and two students were removed by police after attempting a citizen's arrest for alleged crimes committed during his time with the Bush administration. Near the end of the speech, a member of the audience asked, \"Can we have our $40,000 back?\" Rove replied, \"No, you can't.\"[81]\nOn June 24, 2008, Rove said of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, \"Even if you never met him, you know this guy. He's the guy at the country club with the beautiful date, holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone.\"[82]\nIn July 2008, Rove, who was hired by Fox News to provide analysis for the network's November 2008 election coverage, defended his role on the news team to the Television Critics Association.[83]\nRove agreed to debate one-time presidential candidate and former Senator John Edwards on September 26, 2008, at the University at Buffalo.[84] However, Edwards dropped out and was replaced by General Wesley Clark.[85]\n\n2009\u2013present[edit]\nIn September 2009, Rove was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame. The induction became a major dispute as political views clashed over the announcement. Governor John Hoeven was scheduled to introduce Rove during the SAHF banquet but did not attend. At that time, Rove was being investigated by Democrats in Congress for his role in the 2006 dismissal of nine U.S. Attorneys.[86]\nIn 2010, with former RNC chair Ed Gillespie, Rove helped found American Crossroads, a Republican 527 organization raising money for the 2012 election effort.[87] Rove serves as an informal adviser for this Super-PAC.[88]\nIn a profile which appeared in the December 15, 2011 issue of The New Republic, Rove, with his hands-on involvement with American Crossroads, was described as one of the shrewdest navigators of the political climate after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision which exempted political broadcasts funded by corporations and unions from campaign finance limits. \"Rove had no role in creating this new legal environment... but if Rove and his allies did not invent it, they certainly were adroit at exploiting it.\"[89]\nFollowing Todd Akin's comments regarding \"legitimate rape\" and the notion that raped women are unlikely to become pregnant, Rove joked about murdering the Missouri Senate candidate, saying \"We should sink Todd Akin. If he's found mysteriously murdered, don't look for my whereabouts!\"[90][91] After multiple news outlets picked up on the story, Rove apologized for the remark.[92] Rove's Crossroads GPS organization had previously pulled its television advertising from Missouri in the wake of the comments.[93]\nOn November 6, 2012, Rove protested Fox News' call of the 2012 presidential election for Obama, prompting host Megyn Kelly to ask him, \"Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better? Or is this real?\"[94][95][96]\nIn 2013 Rove and the PAC American Crossroads created the Conservative Victory Project for the purpose of supporting electable conservative candidates.[97] These efforts have attracted criticism, and even personal attacks, from elements within the Tea Party movement.[98]\nRove's history, The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the Election of 1896 Still Matters, was published in 2015.[99]\nIn 2017, Rove's 501(c)(4) dark money group One Nation nonprofit raised nearly $17 million, according to IRS tax filings released in November 2018.[100]\nRove has lobbied on behalf of Rivada Networks, a communications technology business.[101][102]\nIn December 2019, Rove predicted that the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries would result in a contested convention; in December 2020, after Joe Biden was nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention with a clear majority of delegates, Politico named Rove's prediction one of \"the most audacious, confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications about the year\".[103]\nRove was an advisor to Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign.[104] In May 2020, Rove accused former president Obama of engaging in a \"political drive by shooting\" after Obama gave a commencement speech to historically black colleges where he criticized the federal government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.[105]\nRove worked as a guest professor at the University of Texas at Austin in the fall semester of 2021.[106] He taught a course for UT's Plan II Honors department called Modern American Political Campaigns. Each week Rove invited guest speakers for the students to interview  including James Carville and Mary Matalin, former Secretary of State James Baker, Jonathon Swan, Ken Melhman, and others. The class was protested by a variety of students accusing Rove of being a war criminal.[107]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nRove at the LBJ Library in 2015\nRove married Houston socialite Valerie Mather Wainwright, on July 10, 1976. He moved to Texas in January 1977. His sister and father said that \"the wedding [that] was so extravagant that [we] ... still recall it with awe\".[108] Rove and Wainwright divorced in early 1980.[109] In January 1986, Rove married Darby Tara Hickson,[15] a breast cancer survivor, graphic designer, and former employee of Karl Rove & Company. Rove and Hickson have one son, Andrew Madison Rove, who attended Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas.[110] Rove and Hickson divorced in December 2009.[111] In June 2012, Rove married lobbyist Karen Johnson in Austin, Texas. The wedding was attended by George W. Bush and Steve Wynn.[112]\nRove resides in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., and also keeps a house near Austin, Texas.[113] In 2002, Rove built a home in Rosemary Beach, Florida, just near Panama City; the home included a television studio for remote news appearances.[114]\nIn a 2007 interview with the New York Review of Books, atheist Christopher Hitchens claimed that Rove was \"not a believer\".[115] However, in 2010, Rove told Kamy Akhavan of ProCon.org in an email exchange that Hitchens had misinterpreted a quote of his about feeling that the faith of other White House staffers was stronger than his own and stating \"I am a practicing Christian who attends a Bible-centered Episcopal church in Washington and an Anglican church in Texas.\"[116]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Baker, Peter (10 March 2010). \"Rove on Rove: A Conversation with the Former Bush Senior Adviser\".
