    "wiki": "Australian columnist and writer\n\n\nMiranda DevineBorn (1961-07-01) 1 July 1961 (age\u00a062)New York City, USEducationMacquarie University (BS)  Northwestern University (Master of Journalism)  University of SydneyOccupationWriterEmployerNew York PostChildren2ParentFrank Devine (father)\nMiranda Devine (born 1 July 1961) is an Australian columnist and writer, now based in New York City. She hosted The Miranda Devine Show on Sydney radio station 2GB until it ended in 2015.[1] She has written columns for Fairfax Media newspapers The Sydney Morning Herald and The Sun-Herald, and for News Limited newspapers Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph, Melbourne's Sunday Herald Sun, and Perth's Sunday Times. As of 2022, she writes for the New York Post. Some of her political opinion pieces and statements on race, gender, and the environment have been the subject of public scrutiny and debate.[2][3][4]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nShe is the eldest daughter of Frank Devine, a New Zealand-born Australian newspaper editor and journalist, who died in 2009. She attended school at Loreto Kirribilli in Sydney and the International School of the Sacred Heart in Tokyo. She has a Master of Science in journalism from Northwestern University (USA) and a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from Macquarie University. Devine studied first-year architecture at the University of Sydney, where she was a resident at Sancta Sophia College and worked briefly at the CSIRO's Division of Textile Physics.[5]\n\nCareer[edit]\nDevine worked for the Boston Herald as a reporter and feature writer. In 1989, Devine joined The Daily Telegraph as assistant editor, police reporter, and columnist after returning to Australia to live in Sydney. She had also previously worked at the British tabloid the Sun and the British newspaper Sunday Times in London. Most recently, Devine's columns, focused on United States politics, are published by the New York Post[6] and she makes appearances promoting her articles on local media outlets. Devine formerly lived in Sydney with her husband and two sons.[5] Devine is the author of the book Laptop from Hell: Hunter Biden, Big Tech, and the Dirty Secrets the President Tried to Hide.[7]\n\nCommentary[edit]\nDevine takes a conservative stance on a range of social and political issues.[8] In April 2016, she coined the term \"delcon\" (delusional conservative) to describe conservatives who remained loyal to Tony Abbott after the Liberal Party ousted him in favour of Malcolm Turnbull.[9][10]\n\nRace[edit]\nIn 2002, Devine opined in the Sydney Morning Herald that the racial element of the Sydney gang rapes had been \"airbrushed\" out of the media coverage of the events. She stated that the victims alleged that prosecutors had intentionally \"censored\" their official statements to remove any mention of racially sensitive material.[11] Devine has also been accused by The Guardian and The Sydney Morning Herald of promoting the white genocide conspiracy theory and has been described as pivotal in popularising the concept within Australian politics.[12] Referring to white South African refugees as \"oppressed white, Christian, industrious, rugby and cricket-playing Commonwealth cousins\", she has claimed they would \"integrate seamlessly\" with European Australians.[13]\n\nEnvironment[edit]\nDevine suggested in 2009 that conservationists were to blame for the poor management of forested areas and national parks, and consequently for the deaths during the Black Saturday bushfires event.[14] This rhetoric was revived during the 2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season,[15] but promptly rejected by the scientific and firefighting community.[16][17] In 2017, she claimed that shared bicycle schemes were a terror threat.[18] Devine is also a climate change denier, advocating for the continuation of coal-fired electricity production and she has repeatedly stated that climate change is a political conspiracy.[19]\n\nGender and LGBTIQ issues[edit]\nIn 2011, Devine used the news of Australian federal government minister Penny Wong's decision to parent a child with her female partner as the basis of a column in which she argued that the 2011 riots in England were the result of a \"fatherless society\".[20][21] Writing for ABC News, Catherine Deveny criticised Devine's claim that same-sex marriage was a \"political tool to undermine the last bastion of bourgeois morality - the traditional nuclear family\".[22]  Devine sparked further controversy in 2015 after claiming that \"women abusing welfare\" were the main cause of domestic violence in Australia and contending \"if you want to break the cycle of violence, end the welfare incentive for unsuitable women to keep having children to a string of feckless men\".[23] In 2016, Devine caused controversy by comparing the purported \"vilification\" of opponents of same-sex marriage in Australia to the victims of  beheadings by ISIS, saying that critics of same-sex marriage were being \"brutally made examples of\" by \"intolerant authoritarians\".[24]\n\nGeorge Pell[edit]\nIn 2019, Devine defended Cardinal George Pell, at the time facing charges of which he was ultimately acquitted, related to the sexual assault of two 13-year-old boys, claiming that the victim's \"accusations are implausible\" and that \"Victoria police chief Graham Ashton desperate for a distraction from the crime epidemic he\u2019s incapable of stopping\".[25]\n\nDonald Trump[edit]\nDevine supported US President Donald Trump. In February 2020, Devine was reported to be \"over the moon\" after being retweeted[26] by Trump.[27] In October 2020, The Guardian described her as \"one of Trump's favourite writers\"[28] after the President again retweeted one of her articles.[29] Devine drew criticism for a \"fantastically fawning love letter\"[30] to Trump in which she described him as an \"invincible hero\" after his recovery from COVID-19[31] and called COVID-19 \"the Chinese virus\".[32] Devine has since repeated Donald Trump's unsuccessful attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election with unsubstantiated claims that Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 United States presidential election was driven by large-scale electoral fraud.[33] In January 2021, Devine blamed past Black Lives Matter demonstrations for the actions of rioters during the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol.[34]\n\nQuaden Bayles[edit]\nIn February 2020, Devine alleged in a series of tweets that a video showing Quaden Bayles, an Indigenous boy with achondroplasia dwarfism, crying after being bullied at school, was a scam and that Bayles was actually an adult actor.[35] That led to Quaden's mother, Yarraka, suing Devine for defamation on behalf of her son, and also suing on her own behalf over Devine's suggestion she had coached Quaden.[36]\nIn September 2020, ahead of an anticipated settlement of the suit, Devine, who was on secondment at the New York Post, tweeted an apology for her allegations that the video had been faked.[37]\n\nHunter Biden[edit]\nMiranda Devine has been cited as the source for a rental application of Hunter Biden's purporting to have previously paid $49,910 of rent a month at a previous property. This has been construed by Tucker Carlson, Judge Jeanine and other Fox News hosts as proof of money laundering within the Biden family. [38] The fact checking website PolitiFact, points out that this claim is wrong, and that the actual property referenced is Hunter Biden's office space in the \"House of Sweden\" building on K Street, Washington, D.C.

Harris Jones (1837 (baptized) \u2013 November 30, 1930), known as Mother Jones from 1897 onwards, was an Irish-born American labor organizer, former schoolteacher, and dressmaker who became a prominent union organizer, community organizer, and activist. She helped coordinate major strikes, secure bans on child labor, and co-founded the socialist trade union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).\nAfter Jones's husband and four children all died of yellow fever in 1867 and her dress shop was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, she became an organizer for the Knights of Labor and the United Mine Workers union. In 1902, she was called \"the most dangerous woman in America\" for her success in organizing miners and their families against the mine owners.[1] In 1903, to protest the lax enforcement of the child labor laws in the Pennsylvania mines and silk mills, she organized a children's march from Philadelphia to the home of President Theodore Roosevelt in New York.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nThe Mother Jones Memorial near her birthplace\nMary G. Harris was born on the north side of Cork, the daughter of Roman Catholic tenant farmers Richard Harris and Ellen (n\u00e9e Cotter) Harris.[2] Her exact date of birth is uncertain; she was baptized on August 1, 1837.[3][4] Harris and her family were victims of the Great Famine, as were many other Irish families. The famine drove more than a million families, including the Harrises, to immigrate to North America, as Harris's family did when Harris was 10.[5]\n\nFormative years[edit]\nMary was a teenager when her family immigrated to Canada.[6] In Canada (and later in the United States), the Harris family were victims of discrimination due to their immigrant status as well as their Catholic faith and Irish heritage. Mary received an education in Toronto at the Toronto Normal School, which was tuition-free and even paid a stipend to each student of one dollar per week for every semester completed. Mary did not graduate from the Toronto Normal School, but she was able to undergo enough training to take a teaching position at a convent in Monroe, Michigan, on August 31, 1859 at the age of 23.[5] She was paid eight dollars per month, but the school was described as a \"depressing place\".[7] After tiring of her assumed profession, she moved first to Chicago and then to Memphis, where in 1861 she married George E. Jones, a member and organizer of the National Union of Iron Moulders,[8] which later became the International Molders and Foundry Workers Union of North America, which represented workers who specialized in building and repairing steam engines, mills, and other manufactured goods.[9] Considering that Mary's husband was providing enough income to support the household, she altered her labor to housekeeping.\nIn 1867, Jones lost her husband and their four children, three girls and a boy all under the age of five, in 1867, during a yellow fever epidemic in Memphis. After that loss, she returned to Chicago to open another dressmaking business.[10] She did work for members of Chicago's upper class in the 1870s and 1880s.[5] In 1871, four years after the death of her family, Jones lost her home, shop, and possessions in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Jones, like many others, helped rebuild the city. According to her autobiography, this led to her joining the Knights of Labor.[11]\n\nPennsylvania state historical marker for Mother Jones in Coaldale, Schuylkill CountyJones started organizing strikes. At first the strikes and protests failed, sometimes ending with police shooting at and killing protesters. Most members of the Knights were men, and by the middle of the 1870s, member numbers leaped to more than a million, becoming the largest labor organization in the United States. The Haymarket Affair of 1886 and the fear of anarchism and social change incited by union organizations resulted in the demise of the Knights of Labor when an unknown person threw a bomb into an altercation between the Chicago police and workers on strike.[5] Once the Knights ceased to exist, Mary Jones became involved mainly with the United Mine Workers (UMW). She frequently led UMW strikers in picketing and encouraged striking workers to stay on strike when management brought in strike-breakers and militias.[9] She believed that \"working men deserved a wage that would allow women to stay home to care for their kids.\"[12] Around this time, strikes were getting better organized and started to produce greater results, such as better pay for the workers.[13]\nJones at New York City Hall in 1915, where she was attending the hearings of the Federal Commission on Industrial Relations\nActive as an organizer and educator in strikes nationwide, she was involved particularly with the UMW and the Socialist Party of America. As a union organizer, she gained prominence for organizing the wives and children of striking workers in demonstrations on their behalf. She was termed \"the most dangerous woman in America\" by a West Virginian district attorney, Reese Blizzard, in 1902 at her trial for ignoring an injunction banning meetings by striking miners. \"There sits the most dangerous woman in America\", announced Blizzard. \"She comes into a state where peace and prosperity reign... crooks her finger, [and] twenty thousand contented men lay down their tools and walk out.\"[1]\nJones was ideologically separated from many female activists of her day due to her lack of commitment to the cause of women's suffrange. She was quoted as saying that \"you don't need the vote to raise hell!\"[14] She opposed many of the activists because she believed it was more important to advocate for the working class than to advocate for women. When some suffragettes accused her of being anti-women's rights, she replied, \"I'm not an anti to anything which brings freedom to my class.\"[15] She became known as a charismatic and effective speaker throughout her career.[16] Occasionally she would include props, visual aids, and dramatic stunts in her speeches.[16] Her talks usually involved the relating of some personal tale in which she invariably \"showed up\" one form of authority or another. It is said Mother Jones spoke in a pleasant-sounding brogue which projected well. When she grew excited, her voice dropped in pitch.[17]\nBy age 60, Jones had assumed the persona of \"Mother Jones\" by claiming to be older than she was, wearing outdated black dresses and referring to the male workers that she helped as \"her boys\". The first reference to her in print as Mother Jones was in 1897.[6]\n\n\"March of the Mill Children\"[edit]\nIn 1901, workers in Pennsylvania's silk mills went on strike. Many of them were young girls demanding to be paid adult wages.[18] The 1900 census had revealed that one sixth of American children under the age of sixteen were employed. John Mitchell, the president of the UMWA, brought Mother Jones to northeastern Pennsylvania in the months of February and September to encourage unity among striking workers. To do so, she encouraged the wives of the workers to organize into a group that would wield brooms, beat on tin pans, and shout \"join the union!\" She felt that wives had an important role to play as the nurturers and motivators of the striking men, but not as fellow workers. She claimed that the young girls working in the mills were being robbed and demoralized.[18] She felt that the rich were denying these children the right to go to school in order to be able to pay for their own children's college tuitions.\nTo enforce worker solidarity, Jones traveled to the silk mills in New Jersey and returned to Pennsylvania to report that the conditions she observed there were much better. She stated that \"the child labor law is better enforced for one thing and there are more men at work than seen in the mills here.\" In response to the strike, mill owners claimed that if the workers insisted on a wage scale, they would not be able to do business while paying adult wages and would be forced to close.[19] Jones encouraged the workers to accept a settlement. Although she agreed to a settlement that sent the young girls back to the mills, she continued to fight child labor for the rest of her life.[19]\nIn 1903, Jones organized children who were working in mills and mines to participate in her famous \"March of the Mill Children\" from Kensington, Philadelphia, to the summer house (and Summer White House) of President Theodore Roosevelt on Long Island (in Oyster Bay, New York). They had banners demanding \"We want to go to school and not the mines!\" and held rallies each night in a new town on the way with music, skits, and speeches drawing thousands of citizens.[20][21][22][23]\nAs Mother Jones noted, many of the children at union headquarters were missing fingers and had other disabilities, and she attempted to get newspaper publicity for the bad conditions experienced by children working in Pennsylvania. However, the mill owners held stock in most newspapers. When the newspapermen informed her that they could not publish the facts about child labor because of this, she remarked \"Well, I've got stock in these little children and I'll arrange a little publicity.\"[24] Permission to see President Roosevelt was denied by his secretary, and it was suggested that Jones address a letter to the president requesting a visit with him Mother Jones wrote a letter requesting a meeting, but never received an answer.[25] Though the president refused to meet with the marchers, the incident brought the issue of child labor to the forefront of the public agenda. The 2003 non-fiction book Kids on Strike! described Jones's Children's Crusade in detail.\n\nActivism and criminal charges[edit]\nDuring the Paint Creek\u2013Cabin Creek strike of 1912 in West Virginia, Mary Jones arrived in June 1912, speaking and organizing despite a shooting war between United Mine Workers members and the private army of the mine owners. Martial law in the area was declared and rescinded twice before Jones was arrested on February 13, 1913, and brought before a military court. Accused of conspiring to commit murder among other charges, she refused to recognize the legitimacy of her court-martial. She was sentenced to twenty years in the state penitentiary. During house arrest at Mrs. Carney's Boarding House, she acquired a dangerous case of pneumonia.[21]\nJones was released after 85 days of confinement, and her release coincided with Indiana Senator John W. Kern's initiation of a Senate investigation into the conditions in the local coal mines. Mary Lee Settle describes Jones at this time in her 1978 novel The Scapegoat. Several months later, she helped organize coal miners in Colorado in the 1913\u201314 United Mine Workers of America strike against the Rockefeller-owned Colorado Fuel and Iron company, in what is known as the Colorado Coalfield War. Once again she was arrested, serving time in prison and inside the San Rafael Hospital, and was escorted from the state in the months prior to the Ludlow Massacre. After the massacre, she was invited to meet with the owner of the Ludlow mine, John D. Rockefeller Jr. The meeting was partially responsible for Rockefeller's 1915 visit to the Colorado mines and introduction of long-sought reforms.[26]\nIn 1917, Mother Jones played a role in the Bloomington Streetcar Strike.[27]\n\nJones with President Calvin Coolidge, 1924\nMother Jones attempted to stop miners from marching into Logan County, West Virginia, in late August 1921. Mother Jones also visited the governor and departed assured he would intervene. Jones opposed the armed march, appeared on the line of march and told them to go home. In her hand, she claimed to have a telegram from President Warren Harding offering to work to end the private police in West Virginia if they returned home. When UMW president Frank Keeney demanded to see the telegram, Mother Jones refused and he denounced her as a 'fake'. Because she refused to show anyone the telegram, and the President's secretary denied ever having sent one, she was suspected of having fabricated the story. After she fled the camp, she reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown.[28]\nMother Jones was joined by Keeney and other UMWA officials who were also pressuring the miners to go home.\n\nLater years[edit]\nJones was denounced on the floor of the U.S. Senate as the \"grandmother of all agitators\". Jones remained a union organizer for the UMW into the 1920s and continued to speak on union affairs almost until she died. She released her own account of her experiences in the labor movement as The Autobiography of Mother Jones (1925).[29] Although Mother Jones organized for decades on behalf of the UMWA in West Virginia and even denounced the state as 'medieval', the chapter of the same name in her autobiography, she mostly praises Governor Ephraim F. Morgan for defending the First Amendment freedom of the weekly labor publication The Federationist to publish. His refusal to consent to the mine owners' request that he ban the paper demonstrated to Mother Jones that he 'refused to comply with the requests of the dominant money interests. To a man of that type, I wish to pay my respects'.[30]\nDuring her later years, Jones lived with her friends Walter and Lillie May Burgess on their farm in what is now Adelphi, Maryland. She celebrated her self-proclaimed 100th birthday there on May 1, 1930, and was filmed making a statement for a newsreel.[31]\n\nDeath[edit]\nMary Harris Jones died on November 30, 1930, at the Burgess farm, then in Silver Spring, Maryland, now part of Adelphi.[32] There was a funeral Mass at St. Gabriel's in Washington, D.C.[33][34]\n\nFuneral of Mother Jones, December 3, 1930\nJones is buried in the Union Miners Cemetery in Mount Olive, Illinois, alongside miners who died in the 1898 Battle of Virden.[35][36][37] She called these miners, killed in strike-related violence, \"her boys.\"[38] In 1932, about 15,000 Illinois mine workers gathered in Mount Olive to protest against the United Mine Workers, which soon became the Progressive Mine Workers of America. Convinced that they had acted in the spirit of Mother Jones, the miners decided to place a proper headstone on her grave. By 1936, the miners had saved up more than $16,000 and were able to purchase \"eighty tons of Minnesota pink granite, with bronze statues of two miners flanking a twenty-foot shaft featuring a bas-relief of Mother Jones at its center.\"[39] On October 11, 1936, also known as Miners' Day, an estimated 50,000 people arrived at Mother Jones's grave to see the new gravestone and memorial. Since then, October 11 is not only known as Miners' Day but is also referred to and celebrated in Mount Olive as \"Mother Jones's Day.\"[citation needed]\nThe farm where she died began to advertise itself as the \"Mother Jones Rest Home\" in 1932, before being sold to a Baptist church in 1956. The site is now marked with a Maryland Historical Trust marker, and a nearby elementary school is named in her honor.[32]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nIn 1930, Mother Jones said the following regarding her legacy: \"I am considered a Bolshevik, and a Red and an I.W.W., and a radical, and I admit to being all they've charged me with. I'm anything that would change monied civilization to a higher and grander civilization for the ages to come. And I long to see the day when labor will have the destination of the nation in her own hands, and she will stand a united force, and show the world what workers can do.\"[40]\nMother Jones remained a well-known symbol for the American labor movement after her death and remains an important symbol for the power of organized labor among activists and organizers, both in the United States and globally.\n\nUnited States Department of Labor poster, 2010Mother Jones' burial site at the Union Miners Cemetery in Mount Olive, Illinois\nJones' words are still invoked by union supporters more than a century later: \"Pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living.\"[41] Already known as \"the miners' angel\" when she was denounced on the floor of the United States Senate as the \"grandmother of all agitators\", she replied, \"I hope to live long enough to be the great-grandmother of all agitators.\"[42]\nMother Jones magazine was established in the 1970s and quickly became \"the largest selling radical magazine of the decade.\"[43]\nIn 1984, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[44]\nDuring the bitter 1989\u201390 Pittston Coal strike in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, the wives and daughters of striking coal miners, inspired by the still-surviving tales of Jones's legendary work among an earlier generation of the region's coal miners, dubbed themselves the \"Daughters of Mother Jones\". They played a crucial role on the picket lines and in presenting the miners' case to the press and public.[45]\nThe Mother Jones Award was granted from 1996 to 2009, though skipping some years, by the Working Women\u2019s History Project and its predecessor, the Women and Labor History Project.[46]\nTo coincide with International Women's Day on March 8, 2010 a proposal from Councillor Ted Tynan for a plaque to be erected in Mary Harris Jones's native Cork City was passed by the Cork City Council.[47] Members of the Cork Mother Jones Commemorative Committee unveiled the plaque[48] on August 1, 2012 to mark the 175th anniversary of her birth. The Cork Mother Jones Festival was also held in 2012 in the Shandon area of the city, close to her birthplace, with numerous guest speakers.[49] The festival now takes place annually around the anniversary and has led to growing awareness of Mother Jones's legacy and links between admirers in Ireland and the US.[50] A new documentary, Mother Jones and Her Children, has been produced by Cork-based Frameworks Films[51] and premiered at the Cork festival in 2014.\nIn 2019, Mother Jones was inducted into the National Mining Hall of Fame.[52]\nMary Harris \"Mother\" Jones Elementary School exists in Adelphi, Maryland.[53]\nStudents at Wheeling Jesuit University, Wheeling, West Virginia, can apply to reside in Mother Jones House, an off-campus service house. Residents perform at least ten hours of community service each week and participate in community dinners and events.[54]\nThe imprisonment of \"Mother\" Jones is commemorated by the State of West Virginia through a Historic Highway marker. The marker was made by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History. The marker reads, \"PRATT. First settled in the early 1780s and incorporated in 1905. Important site in 1912\u201313 Paint\u2013Cabin Creek Strike. Labor organizer 'Mother Jones' spent her 84th birthday imprisoned here. Pratt Historic District, listed on the National Register in 1984, recognizes the town's important residential architecture from early plantation to Victorian Styles.\" The marker is located in the town of Pratt, right off of West Virginia 61.[55]\nMusic and the other arts[edit]\nOn February 25, 1925, Gene Autry recorded the W.C. Callaway composition \"The Death Of Mother Jones\".[56]\nThere is a myth that in The American Songbag (1927), Carl Sandburg suggests that the \"she\" in \"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\" references Mother Jones and her travels to Appalachian mountain coal-mining camps promoting the unionization of the miners. However, there is no reference to Mother Jones in The American Songbag.[57]\nIn the book Uncle (1964) by J.P. Martin, a train line is called Mother Jones's Siding and is rumored to be run by Mother Jones.\nThrough the fall of 1979 to summer 1980, the Overland Stage Company toured The Trial of Mother Jones throughout Wyoming and Colorado. The script by Roger Holzberg (with additional dialogue by Deb Scott) played in schools, community settings, and for union conferences.\u00a0The middle school show was The Walsh Commission by John Murphy.[58]\nThe play The Kentucky Cycle: Fire in the Hole (1991) portrays Jones as an inspirational figure one of the other characters knew and was inspired by to go and create unions in other coal towns.\n\"The most dangerous woman,\" a spoken-word performance by indie folk singer/spoken word performer Utah Phillips with music and backing vocals added to it by indie folk artist Ani Difranco, can be found on their collaborative album Fellow Workers (1999). The title refers to the moniker that a West Virginia District Attorney Reese Blizzard gave to Mother Jones, referring to her as \"the most dangerous woman in America.\"[1] Phillips performed the song \"The Charge on Mother Jones.\" This folk song was written by William M. Rogers.[59]\nThe title track of folk-roots duo Wishing Chair and Kara Barnard\u2019s 2002 album Dishpan Brigade[60] is about Jones and her role in the 1899\u20131900 miners' strike in Arnot, Pennsylvania.[61]\nJones is the \"woman\" in Tom Russell's song \"The Most Dangerous Woman in America,\" a commentary on the troubles of striking miners that appeared on his 2009 album Blood and Candle Smoke on the Shout! Factory label.\n\"The Spirit of Mother Jones\" is a track on the 2010 Abocurragh album by Irish singer-songwriter Andy Irvine.[62]\nThe play Can't Scare Me...the Story of Mother Jones was written and performed by actress, playwright, and professor Kaiulani Lee. It premiered at the Atlas Theater in Washington, D.C. in 2011, and Lee took the show on tour with the United Mine Workers across Colorado as well as tours in Ireland, Bangladesh, and Cambodia.[63]\nMother Jones in Heaven is a one-woman musical written by the singer-songwriter and activist Si Kahn. It had its world premiere in Juneau, Alaska, in March 2014.\nMother Jones and the Children's Crusade, a musical based on her work in Pennsylvania, debuted in July 2014 as part of the New York Musical Theatre Festival in NYC. The play starred Robin de Jesus and Lynne Wintersteller.[64]\n\"Never Call Me a Lady\" (published 2015)[65] (Brooklyn Publishers) is a 10-minute monologue by playwright Rusty Harding, in which Mother Jones recounts her life to a fellow traveler in a Chicago train station.\nVictory at Arnot is a work for chamber group and narrator by composer Eleanor Aversa.[66] It recounts how Mother Jones assisted with the coal miners' strike in 1899\u20131900 in Arnot, Pennsylvania, and celebrates the power of non-violent resistance. The piece premiered in Philadelphia in 2016 and was followed by performances in Boston.[67]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Sandra L. Ballard; Patricia L. Hudson (2013).

Her parents were Ellen Cotter, a native of Inchigeela and Richard Harris from Cork city. Few details of her life in Cork have been uncovered to date, though it is thought by some that she was born on Blarney Street and may have attended the North Presentation Schools nearby.

It is owned and operated by the network's NBC Owned Television Stations division alongside Class A Telemundo outlet WRDM-CD (channel 19). Both stations share studios on New Britain Avenue in West Hartford and transmitter facilities on Rattlesnake Mountain in Farmington, Connecticut.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nEarly years[edit]\nWVIT signed on for the first time on February 13, 1953, as WKNB-TV, owned by the New Britain Broadcasting Company along with WKNB radio (840 AM, now WRYM).[3] The calls stood for Kensington\u2013New Britain. It is Connecticut's second-oldest television station and the first on the UHF band.[4] It has been an NBC affiliate for nearly all of its history. However, during its first two and a half years, it carried CBS programming as one of two affiliates in Connecticut,[5] along with WNHC-TV (now WTNH) in New Haven. At the time, Hartford and New Haven were recognized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as separate television markets; the commission would merge them into one market in 1954.\nIn January 1955, NBC announced it would purchase the WKNB stations for just over $600,000.[6] Though the network was acquiring both radio and television outlets, the key to the deal was channel 30\u2013as one of the first UHF stations to be owned by a major network, the FCC encouraged the networks to expand their owned-and-operated holdings to include outlets in the new band to help ensure its viability. Indeed, NBC made plans to boost channel 30's signal to cover the entire market.\nWKNB-TV began carrying the full NBC programming schedule in October 1955. The FCC approved the sale to NBC in December 1956, nearly two years after it was first announced.[7] The network then renamed channel 30 WNBC (for New Britain, Connecticut) in January 1957.[8][9][10] In its first stint as an NBC-owned station, channel 30 failed to gain much headway in the ratings, largely because television manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuning capability until 1964. Viewers had to buy an expensive converter to watch WNBC, and even with one the picture was barely viewable. In addition, plans to relocate the station's tower and to boost transmission power never moved forward.\nIn September 1957, the Hartford-based Travelers Insurance Company signed on independent station WTIC-TV (channel 3, now WFSB), the state's second and last VHF station. Within a year of its debut (and despite its radio sister having been an NBC radio affiliate for over thirty years) WTIC-TV became Connecticut's CBS affiliate, replacing its owned-and-operated station, WHCT-TV (channel 18, now Univision affiliate WUVN). NBC then realized its UHF experiment was a lost cause (it had shut down its other owned UHF station in Buffalo, New York, in October 1958), and in June 1959 sold WNBC and WKNB radio for $750,000 to Plains Television Inc., a joint venture of Transcontinental Properties and H & E Balaban Corporation (WKNB was spun off immediately afterward).[11][12] As part of the deal, Springfield Television, the owner of fellow NBC affiliate WWLP in Springfield, Massachusetts, was to have held a one-third share in channel 30; it abandoned this stake before the deal's completion after concerns arose over WWLP and WNBC's overlapping coverage areas, but continued to hold an option to reacquire it for some time afterward pending FCC approval.[13] In May 1960, channel 30's callsign changed again \u2013 this time to WHNB-TV (for Hartford-New Britain); NBC reclaimed the WNBC calls for its flagship radio and television combination (the former WRCA-AM-FM-TV) in New York City.[14][15]\nIn 1966, WHNB-TV became, once again, one of two NBC affiliates in Connecticut; the network signed with Waterbury-licensed WATR-TV (channel 20) in order to get its programming into New Haven on a strong signal.[16] By this time, television manufacturers were now required to include all-channel tuning. Channel 30 itself made up for the shortfall in its market coverage by operating two low-power translators (starting in 1971): W79AI (channel 79) in Torrington[17] and W59AA (channel 59) in New Haven.[18] They also operated W79AH in Waterbury in the 1960s.\n\nViacom and NBC ownership[edit]\nWVIT's NBC30 logo used from 2005 until July 16, 2009. The numeric \"30\" had been in use in one form or another since 1992.\nIn the summer of 1977, Plains Television announced it would sell WHNB-TV to the original iteration of Viacom for $15 million. The former CBS Inc. subsidiary was making its first foray into broadcast station ownership.[19] Shortly after assuming control in the spring of 1978, channel 30's call letters were changed to the present WVIT on June 12 (for \"Viacom International Television\") to reflect its new ownership.[20][21] Viacom immediately announced plans to boost WVIT's signal, and also made upgrades in the station's news department.[22] In 1980, channel 30 signed on with a new transmitter that more than doubled its coverage area, giving it a clear signal to much of New Haven for the first time, though the channel 59 repeater was kept in service. WVIT became the sole Connecticut-based NBC affiliate in March 1982, when WATR-TV's affiliation contract with NBC ended and the station became independent WTXX (it is now WCCT-TV).[23] The Torrington translator was turned off in 1987, and the New Haven repeater was shut down in the middle 1990s to allow full-powered WTVU (now WCTX) to begin operations. In 1993, WVIT and WTXX entered into a part-time local marketing agreement after talks with Fox affiliate WTIC-TV (channel 61) failed.[24]\nViacom purchased Paramount Pictures in 1994, placing its five-station group (WVIT; KMOV in St. Louis; WHEC-TV in Rochester, New York; WNYT in Albany, New York; and KSLA-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana) under common ownership with the Paramount Stations Group;[25][26] the two groups were formally consolidated in December 1995.[27] The merged company decided to divest itself of all of its major network affiliates to focus on stations that carried its then-upstart United Paramount Network (UPN).[28] WVIT, the first television outlet Viacom purchased was the last station to be sold, as Viacom agreed to trade channel 30 to former owner NBC in return for future purchase rights to WWHO in Chillicothe, Ohio and WLWC in New Bedford, Massachusetts, two UPN-affiliated stations NBC was operating by way of local marketing agreements. The sale closed on December 8, 1997, making WVIT an NBC O&O for the second time in its history. It also ended its part-time LMA with WTXX, and the LMA deal was transferred to WTIC-TV.[29][30]\nOn December 4, 2017, NBCUniversal announced that it would buy Telemundo affiliate WRDM-CD and its Springfield satellite station WDMR-LP from ZGS Communications, as with several other NBC O&Os, WRDM would become a sister station to WVIT, creating the third duopoly in the Hartford\u2013New Haven television market, following the duopolies of Nexstar Media Group's WTNH/WCTX and Tegna's WTIC-TV/WCCT-TV (though as a low-power station, WRDM is exempt from FCC ownership caps, including the duopoly rule).[31] ZGS had sold WRDM's spectrum in the FCC's incentive auction for $10,574,516 and indicated that the station would enter into a post-auction channel sharing agreement, which occurred with WVIT at the start of the year.[32] The sale was officially completed on February 1, 2018.[33]\n\nProgramming[edit]\nOn June 16, 2017, WVIT announced that it would not air that week's edition of Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly, which featured an interview with radio host Alex Jones. The station cited viewer, advertiser and management sensitivities to the views of Jones, as he had previously expressed a denial of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings.[34][35] Otherwise, the station clears the entire NBC lineup.\n\nNews operation[edit]\nThis section needs expansion with: early history of WVIT's news operation. You can help by adding to it.  (November 2020)\nOn June 13, 2016, WVIT became the second station in Connecticut to debut a 4:00\u00a0p.m. newscast.[36] On the same day, WVIT began using Artworks' new \"Look N\" standardized graphics that were first adopted by sister station WNBC, while its music changed to 615 Music's \"The Tower\", which was first adopted in 2000 by sister stations WMAQ-TV and KNBC.\nOn June 7, 2021, WVIT debuted its 7:00\u00a0p.m. newscast, becoming the first and only station in Connecticut to have a prime time newscast.\n\nNotable former on-air staff[edit]\nChris Berman (now sportscaster for ESPN since 1979)\nVan Hackett\nBrian Kilmeade (now political commentator for Fox News)\nRob Marciano (now senior meteorologist for ABC News)\nNatalie Morales (later with NBC News, now with the CBS Daytime talk show The Talk)\nRob Morrison\nBeasley Reece (formerly with KYW-TV in Philadelphia from 1998 to 2015)\nBrian Shactman (now with CNBC)\nChris Wragge (now with WCBS-TV)\nTechnical information[edit]\nSubchannels[edit]\nThe station's signal is multiplexed:\n\n\nSubchannels of WVIT[37]\n\n\nChannel\n\nRes.\n\nAspect\n\nShort name\n\nProgramming\n\n\n30.1\n\n1080i\n16:9\nWVIT-HD\nMain WVIT programming / NBC\n\n\n30.2\n\n480i\nCOZI-TV\nCozi TV\n\n\n30.3\n\nNBCLX\nLX\n\n\n30.4\n\nOXYGEN\nOxygen\n\nDigital subchannel 30.2 carried NBC Weather Plus; national network operations for that service ended in December 2008. NBC Plus then aired on that subchannel. This channel utilized the same graphics as Weather Plus, with a new 'NBC Plus' logo, and without the on-camera meteorologist segments. On December 20, 2012, WVIT replaced NBC Plus with Cozi TV; WVIT was the last NBC-owned station to carry NBC Plus. Digital subchannel 30.3 carried Universal Sports until its transition into a cable- and satellite-exclusive service on January 1, 2012, and eventually Universal Sports shut down altogether on November 16, 2015. The 30.3 subchannel was reactivated in 2015, when WVIT added the Spanish-language digital network TeleXitos, normally only carried on Telemundo stations; TeleXitos moved to a subchannel of WRDM-CD after its acquisition by NBCUniversal in February 2018. WVIT again reactivated the 30.3 subchannel in 2020, coinciding with the launch of LX.\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion[edit]\nWVIT's NBC Connecticut first logo, used from July 2009 until July 2017\nWVIT shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 30, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television.[38] The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 35, using PSIP to display WVIT's virtual channel as 30 on digital television receivers. With the transition, the height of the station's transmitter tower was increased to 434 meters (1,424\u00a0ft).\n\nSpectrum auction repack[edit]\nOn August 2, 2019, WVIT was moved from channel 35 to channel 31.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"FCC begins granting new TV; Denver gets three.\" Broadcasting \u2013 Telecasting, July 14, 1952, pp. 5, 102.
