For the politician, see Kathleen Parker (politician).\nKathleen ParkerParker in 2016Born1951/1952 (age 71-72)Winter Haven, Florida, U.S.EducationWinter Haven High SchoolAlma\u00a0mater\nConverse College\nFlorida State University (M.A.1976 in Spanish)\nOccupationColumnistNotable credit(s)Orlando SentinelThe Washington Post (1987\u2013present)SpouseWoody ClevelandChildren1\nKathleen Parker (born 1951/1952) is a columnist for The Washington Post. Parker is a consulting faculty member at the Buckley School of Public Speaking, a popular guest on cable and network news programs and a regular guest on NBC's Meet the Press, and previously on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews.\nParker considers herself politically to be \"mostly right of center\",[1] has been described as a \"conservative-leaning columnist\",[2] and was the highest-scoring conservative pundit in a 2012 retrospective study of pundit prediction accuracy in 2008.[3]\n\n\nEarly life and career[edit]\nParker was raised in Winter Haven in Polk County, Florida,[4] daughter of lawyer John Hal Connor Jr. and Connor's first wife, Martha Ayer Harley (originally from Barnwell County, South Carolina[5] who died in March 1955[6] when Parker was 3 years old[4]). Parker often spent summers with her mother's family in Columbia, South Carolina.[5]\nParker attended Converse College before Florida State University, where she received a bachelor's degree in 1973 followed by a master's degree in Spanish in 1976.[7]\nParker's career in journalism began in 1977, when she was hired to cover Hanahan, Goose Creek and Moncks Corner by the now-defunct Charleston Evening Post.[5]\nA columnist since 1987, she has worked for five newspapers, from Florida to California. She has written for several magazines, including The Weekly Standard, Time, Town & Country, Cosmopolitan, and Fortune Small Business.\nShe serves on the Board of Contributors for USA Today's Forum Page, part of the newspaper's Opinion section. She is also a contributor to the online magazine The Daily Beast. Parker is the author of Save the Males: Why Men Matter, Why Women Should Care.\nFrom fall 2010, Parker co-hosted the cable news program Parker Spitzer on CNN with former New York governor Eliot Spitzer.[8]\nParker was the 1993 winner of the H. L. Mencken Writing Award presented by The Baltimore Sun.[9] The Week magazine named her one of the nation's top five columnists in 2004 and 2005.[10] She won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for a selection of political opinion columns.[11]\nParker wrote about the April 2019 arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador, London, comparing him unfavorably to the \"historic act of bravery\" by Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers about American government lies in the Vietnam War. Assange's \"non-fans\u2014including many in the U.S. media\u2014long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech.\".[12]\n\nControversies[edit]\nDuring the 2008 U.S. presidential election Parker called on the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Governor Sarah Palin, to step down from the party ticket (the day before the Vice-Presidential debate), saying that a series of media interviews showed that Palin was \"clearly out of her league\".[13][14][15] Parker received over 11,000 responses, mostly from conservatives critical of  her opinion.[16]\nDuring the 2018 Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination, Parker wrote a column advancing the theory that the alleged victim, Christine Blasey Ford, was mistaken in her identification of Brett Kavanaugh, and that there must be a doppelg\u00e4nger.[17] The doppelg\u00e4nger theory was criticized by other Washington Post columnists, such as Max Boot,[18] Erik Wemple,[19][20] Jennifer Rubin, E. J. Dionne, and Avi Selk.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nParker is married to an attorney, Sherwood M. \"Woody\" Cleveland, has one son and two stepsons, and resides in Camden, South Carolina.[5][21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"'Parker Spitzer' Preview; Tony Curtis Remembered\".

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as the U.S. representative for California's 25th congressional district from January to November 2019. Hill is the former executive director of People Assisting the Homeless (PATH), a statewide non-profit organization working to end homelessness throughout California. She won her seat by defeating incumbent Republican Steve Knight in the 2018 midterm elections.\nOn October 18, 2019, RedState, a conservative blog, published a report on an alleged affair between Hill and her Legislative Director, which they both denied. On October 23, 2019, Hill admitted that she had had an inappropriate relationship with a campaign staffer before she became a Member of Congress. On October 27, 2019, she announced that she would resign from Congress. Nude photos of Hill were published by the Daily Mail, a British tabloid. Hill blamed the release of the photos on her ex-husband, called them an invasion of privacy and vowed to advocate for victims of revenge porn. She resigned on November 3, 2019, and left office two days later.\nIn June 2021, Hill was ordered to pay US$220,000 to the Daily Mail and other media, to reimburse the legal fees these companies spent defending themselves against her accusations.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nHill was born in Abilene, Texas, and grew up in the Saugus section of Santa Clarita, California. Her mother, Rachel (nee' Campbell),[2] was a registered nurse, and her father, Michael Hill, was a police lieutenant.[3] Hill attended public schools in the Santa Clarita Valley and graduated from Saugus High School in 2004.[4] She attended California State University, Northridge where she earned a bachelor's degree in English and a Master of Public Administration.[5]\n\nEarlier career[edit]\nHill began her career as a policy advocate at People Assisting the Homeless (PATH), a nonprofit organization developing affordable and supportive services for the homeless in California. Her husband allegedly worked there as well, and it is claimed Hill was his boss.[6] Later as the Executive Director for PATH, she raised the organization from a local force in Los Angeles County to one of the largest nonprofit providers of homes for the homeless in California.[7] Hill helped pass a ballot initiative, Measure H, during spring of 2017 to help alleviate homelessness by providing $1.2 billion in funds for homeless services in Los Angeles County.[8][9] Hill and her husband also raised goats in Agua Dulce, California.[7]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives[edit]\nElections[edit]\n2018[edit]\nMain article: 2018 United States House of Representatives elections in California \u00a7\u00a0District 25\nHill speaking at the California Democratic Party State Convention (2019).\nOn March 8, 2017, Hill announced her candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives for California's 25th congressional district, her home district, challenging incumbent Steve Knight, a Republican who had held the office since 2014.[10] Knight won re-election in 2016.[11][12]\nIn 2018, Hill came in second place in the primary election for California's 25th Congressional District, allowing her to advance to the November 6, 2018, general election, where she again faced Knight.[13] In the general election, she defeated Knight by a 54% vs. 46% tally.[citation needed]\nShe was the subject of a documentary-style series of episodes that aired on the HBO show Vice News Tonight.[14] The series documented the Hill campaign as the \"most millennial campaign ever\" for Congress.[15] Vice News Tonight reportedly planned on doing a follow-up episode regarding Hill's advancement to the general election.[16] In the weeks leading up to the midterm election, Hill was endorsed by former President Barack Obama, who also attended a campaign event in Southern California leading up to the election.[17]\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nHill stated during her race for office that her top issues were addressing healthcare, rebuilding the middle class with policies that address income inequality and affordable housing, and getting big money out of politics.[9][18][19] She also stated her support for Medicare for All.[20]\nHill reportedly ran a grassroots campaign that didn't accept money from corporate political action committees.[21] In the first quarter of 2018, she raised over $400,000, bringing her total to $1,092,025 raised, with more than 9,800 individual contributions and more than 5,100 individual donors.[22]\nHill has supported comprehensive immigration reform while working towards greater funding and security along the southern border to counter primarily illegal drug trafficking and other various crimes. She also has supported some form of physical barrier along certain areas of the southern border.[23][24][25]\n\nAccording to an October 2018 article in Rolling Stone, Hill is an unabashed gun owner: \"We have the highest number of law enforcement officials of any district in my county. And we have the second-highest number of veterans of any district in the country. On top of that, a quarter of our district is rural. So people do own guns. That's how my husband and I both grew up. Forty percent of our district owns a gun or lives in a household with a gun.\"[7]\nTenure[edit]\nBefore the start of the 116th Congress, Hill and Colorado freshman U.S. Representative Joe Neguse were chosen as the freshman class representatives for the Democratic Caucus.[26]\n\nCommittee assignments[edit]\nCommittee on Armed Services\nSubcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces\nSubcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces\nCommittee on Oversight and Reform (Vice Chair)\nSubcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy\nUnited States House Oversight Subcommittee on Environment\nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology\nSubcommittee on Space and Aeronautics\nCaucus memberships[edit]\nCongressional LGBT Equality Caucus (Co-Chair)\nCongressional Progressive Caucus\nNew Democrat Coalition\nAccusations of improper relationships[edit]\nHill's final speech on her decision to resign (October 31, 2019).\nOn October 18, 2019, the conservative political blog RedState published allegations that Hill was involved in an extramarital affair with her young male staffer. Hill denied such allegations,[27] with Hill saying that her estranged husband, whom she described as abusive, was doing everything he could to humiliate her, and that her political opponents were exploiting a private matter for political gain.[28] Her husband denied the allegations of abuse.[29] Hill reached out to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi to deny the allegations.[30]\nOn October 23, 2019, Hill sent an email to constituents in which she admitted to an inappropriate relationship with a campaign staffer before becoming a member of Congress.[31][32] The relationship was with a 22-year-old female subordinate recently out of college.[33][34] RedState also published nude photos of Hill as part of the story. Hill said that the U.S. Capitol Police opened an investigation into who may have leaked the photos.[35]\n\nInvestigation[edit]\nThe House Ethics Committee announced on October 23, 2019, that it would conduct an investigation into the allegation that Hill had an affair with her staffer,[36] which would be in violation of House ethics reforms that were implemented in 2018 in response to the #MeToo movement.[37][38][39] Hill promised to cooperate with the Congressional ethics investigation regarding allegations of wrongdoing as a member of Congress.[31][32]\n\nResignation[edit]\nOn October 27, 2019, Hill announced via Twitter that she would resign from Congress:[40][41] \"This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents and our country.\"[42] Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Hill made \"some errors in judgment that made her continued service as a Member untenable\".[43] Hill vowed to combat revenge porn after photos of her were leaked.[44]\n\nIn her last speech before Congress on October 31, 2019, Hill said there was a \"double standard\" and \"misogynistic culture\" that resulted in her decision to step down from her position: \"I'm leaving, but we have men who have been credibly accused of intentional acts of sexual violence and remain in boardrooms, on the Supreme Court, in this very body, and worst of all, in the Oval Office...As my final act I voted to move forward with the impeachment of Donald Trump on behalf of the women of the United States of America.\"[45][46]\nOn December 7, 2019, Hill penned an op-ed in The New York Times in which she described the events that led to her decision to resign, and mentions that she was suicidal during that time period.[47]\n\nAftermath[edit]\nIn the special election held in the spring of 2020, Hill endorsed State Assemblywoman Christy Smith, who ultimately lost the election in an upset. Hill, whose PAC contributed $200,000,[48] said that Smith had been considered \"the mom of Democratic politics\" in the district for years, and that \"there's no one else that I could even think of that I would want to run for this.\"[49] Some Democrats regretted Hill's involvement in the campaign.[50]\nAfter Hill's resignation, Monica Lewinsky reached out and offered to talk about some of the similarities and differences in being the victim of public shaming.[51]\nIn December 2020, Hill filed a lawsuit against her ex-husband, the Daily Mail, and RedState over \"non consensual porn\".[52] On April 7, 2021, a judge ruled in favor of the Daily Mail, finding that the photos are protected as \"a matter of public issue or public interest\" under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Hill's attorneys said they plan to appeal the decision.[53][54][55] The judge also ordered Hill to pay roughly $220,000 in fees to the Daily Mail and a couple of journalists.[56]\nOn April 5, 2021, Hill called for Matt Gaetz to resign in an opinion piece for Vanity Fair, after it was reported that Gaetz had allegedly shown pictures of naked women he claimed to have slept with, including to colleagues on the House floor.[57] Gaetz had supported Hill after the leak of her photos, and Hill called him an \"unlikely friend\" during their time in Congress.[58][59][60]\n\nElectoral history[edit]\n\nCalifornia's 25th congressional district election, 2018\n\n\nPrimary election\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nSteve Knight (incumbent)\n\n61,411\n\n51.8\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nKatie Hill\n\n24,507\n\n20.7\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nBryan Caforio\n\n21,821\n\n18.4\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nJess Phoenix\n\n7,549\n\n6.4\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nMary Pallant\n\n3,157\n\n2.7\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n118,445 \n\n100.0 \n\n\nGeneral election\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nKatie Hill \n\n133,209 \n\n54.4 \n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nSteve Knight (incumbent)\n\n111,813\n\n45.6\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n245,022 \n\n100.0 \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic gain from Republican\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nHill came out as bisexual after high school.[61] She was California's first openly bisexual person to be elected to Congress.[62]\nHill had a tattoo of an Iron Cross on her lower groin, which she got after a sexual assault as a teenager.

A member of the Republican Party, he was the U.S. Representative for California's 20th congressional district from 2007 until his resignation in 2023.\nMcCarthy graduated from California State University, Bakersfield. He served two terms as a member of the California State Assembly before being elected to the U.S. House in 2006. McCarthy served as the House Republican chief deputy whip from 2009 to 2011 and as House majority whip from 2011 to 2014.[1][2] After House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's reelection loss in the 2014 Republican primary, McCarthy was elected majority leader under speaker John Boehner. He retained that position during Paul Ryan's speakership. In 2019, after Ryan retired, McCarthy was elected House Minority Leader.[3]\nAs Minority Leader, McCarthy supported Donald Trump's debunked claims of voter fraud after Joe Biden won the 2020 U.S. presidential election and initially participated in efforts to overturn the results. After the U.S. Capitol was stormed during the 2021 electoral vote count, McCarthy reversed his previous comments on voter fraud in the election and blamed Trump for the riot.[4][5][6][7] By 2022, he had publicly reconciled with Trump.[8][9] McCarthy led the House Republicans through the 2022 elections, in which they gained a slimmer-than-expected majority.\nMcCarthy was the Republican nominee for speaker in January 2023, but did not win the speakership on the first attempt, only securing the office after days of successive votes and negotiations within his own party as well as a historic 15 different ballots.[10][11][12] As Speaker, McCarthy dealt with a standoff between the House Republican conference and Biden administration that led to the 2023 debt-ceiling crisis and what would have been a first-ever national default. To resolve the crisis, the parties negotiated the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which passed with bipartisan support in Congress before Biden signed it into law.[13]\nIn September 2023, McCarthy relied on Democrats to help pass a bipartisan continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown. As a result, Republican congressman Matt Gaetz filed a motion to vacate against McCarthy.[14] Following a largely unprecedented House floor debate between members of the majority party, McCarthy was voted out as speaker on October 3, 2023.[15] His tenure was the third-shortest for a Speaker of the House in United States history,[16][c] and he became the first speaker to ever be removed from the role during a legislative session.[17][18][19] McCarthy resigned as a member of the House at the end of that year.[20]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nMcCarthy was born on January 26, 1965, in Bakersfield, California.[21] He is the son of Owen McCarthy[22][23] an assistant city fire chief,[24][25][26]\nand Roberta Darlene (n\u00e9e Palladino),[27] a homemaker. McCarthy is a fourth-generation resident of Kern County. His maternal grandfather was an Italian immigrant, and his paternal grandfather was Irish.[28] McCarthy is the first Republican in his immediate family, as his parents were members of the Democratic Party.[29][30] He attended Bakersfield High School, where he played on the football team, from 1979 to 1983.[31]\nIn 1984, at age 19, McCarthy ran his first business selling sandwiches out of the back of his uncle's yogurt shop on Stine Road.[32][33]\nMcCarthy attended California State University, Bakersfield, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science in marketing in 1989 and a Master of Business Administration in 1994.[34] During college, he worked as a seasonal firefighter for the Kern County Fire Department.[35]\n\nEarly political career[edit]\nMcCarthy served on the staff of Congressman Bill Thomas from 1987 to 2002.[34] In 1995, he chaired the California Young Republicans. From 1999 to 2001, he chaired the Young Republican National Federation.[30] From the late 1990s until 2000, he was Thomas's district director.[34] McCarthy won his first election in 2000, as a Kern Community College District trustee.[34] Thomas has since criticized McCarthy in numerous interviews.[36]\nMcCarthy was elected to the California State Assembly in 2002.[37] He became the Republican floor leader in 2003.[38] In 2006, McCarthy was first elected to the United States House of Representatives as a representative for California's 22nd district.[39] He succeeded his former boss, Bill Thomas,[40] who retired.[41] The district was renumbered as the 23rd district in 2013,[42][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] and again as the 20th district in 2023.[43][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n20072013201720192023Portraits of Kevin McCarthy as a Member of the House.\nCommittee assignments[edit]\nCommittee on Financial Services\nSubcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises\nSubcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit\nCaucus memberships\n\nCongressional Western Caucus[44]\nParty leadership[edit]\nHouse Republican steering committee\nHouse Republican Chief Deputy Whip, 2009\u20132011\nHouse Majority Whip, 2011\u20132014\nHouse Majority Leader, 2014\u20132019\nHouse Minority Leader, 2019\u20132023\nSpeaker of the House,  January to October 2023\nEarly leadership posts[edit]\nRepresentative McCarthy at an oversight hearing of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power\nAs a freshman congressman, McCarthy was appointed to the Republican Steering committee. Republican leader John Boehner appointed him chair of the Republican platform committee during the committee's meetings in Minneapolis in August 2008, which produced the Republican Party Platform for 2008. He was also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program.[45] After the 2008 elections, he was chosen as chief deputy minority whip, the highest-ranking appointed position in the House Republican Conference. His predecessor, Eric Cantor, was named minority whip.\n\nHouse majority whip[edit]\nOn November 17, 2010, the House Republican Conference selected McCarthy to be the House majority whip in the 112th Congress. In this post, he was the third-ranking House Republican, behind Speaker John Boehner and majority leader Eric Cantor.\nIn August 2011, McCarthy and Cantor led a group of 30 Republican members of Congress to Israel, where some members took part in a late-night swim in the Sea of Galilee, including one member\u2014Kevin Yoder\u2014who swam nude.[46] When McCarthy and Cantor later found out about the swim, they were \"furious\" and worried about negative news coverage, and \"called a members-only meeting the next morning to reprimand the group\u2014both those who swam and those who abstained\".[46]\nIn 2012, McCarthy's office reported spending $99,000 on pastries, bottled water, and other food items, making him the highest-spending member of the House in this category.[47]\n\nHouse majority leader[edit]\nNorman L. Eisen, Condoleezza Rice and McCarthy in Prague, Czech Republic, 2011\nCantor lost the June 2014 primary for his seat in Congress, and announced he would step down from House leadership at the end of July. McCarthy sought to succeed Cantor, and after some speculation that Pete Sessions and Jeb Hensarling would challenge him, both dropped out, leaving McCarthy a clear path to become majority leader.[48] On June 13, representative Raul Labrador announced he would also seek the leadership position.[49] On June 19, the Republican Conference elected McCarthy majority leader.[50][51]\nAccording to the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs, McCarthy is the least-tenured majority leader in the history of the House of Representatives. When he assumed the position in July 2014, he had served only seven years, six months and 29 days, the least experience of any floor leader in the House's history by more than a year.[52]\nMcCarthy kept four of his predecessor's staff members on his staff when he took over as majority leader, including deputy chief of staff Neil Bradley, who now has served in that role for three majority leaders.[53]\nMcCarthy has been under fire for avoiding meetings and town-hall events with constituents in his congressional district for years.[54][55][56] His last town hall was in June 2010.[57] He has opted for screened telephone calls since.[58]\nIn December 2017, McCarthy voted for the House Republican tax legislation.[59] After the vote, he asked his constituents to \"Come February, check your check, because that will be the pay raise of the vote for Donald Trump.\"[60]\nAn October 2018 investigation documented how William \"Bill\" Wages, of McCarthy's brother-in-law's company Vortex Construction, has received $7.6 million since 2000 in no-bid and other prime federal contracts as a minority business (a claim that has been disputed). The work was mostly for construction projects at the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in McCarthy's Bakersfield-based district, and Naval Air Station Lemoore in California's Kings County.[61]\n\nUnsuccessful 2015 candidacy for speaker of the House[edit]\nSee also: October 2015 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election\nOn September 25, 2015, John Boehner decided to resign as speaker effective October 30, 2015. Many media outlets speculated that McCarthy would likely replace him,[62] and Boehner himself said that McCarthy \"would make an excellent speaker\".[63] On September 28, McCarthy formally announced his candidacy.[64] Having held congressional office for less than nine years, McCarthy would have been the speaker with the least time in Congress since 1891.[65]\nIn a September 29, 2015, interview with Fox News's Sean Hannity, McCarthy was asked what Republicans had accomplished in Congress. He replied by talking about the House of Representatives' special panel investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack (in which Islamic militants attacked the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya). Republicans said the purpose of the government-funded committee was purely to investigate the deaths of four Americans.[66] But McCarthy said, \"Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought.\"[67] The comment was seen as an admission that the investigation was a partisan political undertaking rather than a substantive inquiry.[68][69][70][71] Some commentators described his remark as a classic \"Kinsley gaffe\" (defined as when a politician accidentally tells the truth).[72] The remark was also described as \"saying the quiet part loud\".[73] Several days later, McCarthy apologized for the remarks and said the Benghazi panel was not a political initiative.[74][75]\nOn October 8, 2015, as Republicans were preparing to vote, McCarthy unexpectedly dropped out of the race, saying that Republicans needed a fresh face who could unite the caucus and \"I am not that guy.\"[76] He reportedly dropped out after concluding that he did not have the 218 votes that would be required to be elected speaker.[74] McCarthy remained majority leader.[76][74] The Benghazi gaffe contributed to his decision to withdraw from the race,[73][76] as McCarthy acknowledged in announcing his withdrawal.[76] Previously, Representative Walter B. Jones Jr. had sent a letter to the Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers stating that any candidates for a leadership position with \"misdeeds\" should withdraw from the race. Jones has said that his comment did not specifically refer to McCarthy.[77]\nPaul Ryan instead won the 2015 election and became speaker from 2015 to 2019.\n\nHouse minority leader[edit]\nKevin McCarthy as House Minority Leader, 2019\nAfter the Republicans lost their majority in the 2018 elections, McCarthy was elected Minority Leader, fending off a challenge to his right from Jim Jordan of Ohio, 159\u201343. While as majority leader he had been the second-ranking House Republican behind Ryan, as minority leader he was now the leader of the House Republicans.[3][78]\nMcCarthy has been a strong supporter of Donald Trump since 2016.[79] As minority leader, he remained a close Trump ally, keeping the Republican caucus unified in support of Trump and against his impeachment on two articles of impeachment arising from the Trump-Ukraine scandal.[73] McCarthy associated with key figures in Trump's effort to enlist the Ukrainian government in discrediting Joe Biden, Trump's political opponent; such figures included Lev Parnas, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Robert F. Hyde.[73]\nLike Trump, McCarthy supported Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican candidate in 2020 for a U.S. House seat from northwest Georgia; Greene's past racist, anti-Semitic comments and her promotion of QAnon (a far-right conspiracy theory) led other Republicans to distance themselves from her.[79][80] McCarthy did not take steps to thwart Greene's candidacy and did not endorse her opponent in the Republican primary runoff election.[79] After Greene was nominated, McCarthy denounced the fringe conspiracy, saying, \"There is no place for QAnon in the Republican Party\", and said that Greene had distanced herself from her earlier statements.[81] In 2020, McCarthy was asked about Trump's false claims that Joe Scarborough (an MSNBC host and former Republican congressman) was linked to the death of a staff member; a few House Republicans criticized Trump for making inflammatory and false statements, but McCarthy declined to take a position.[82] McCarthy's predecessor, Bill Thomas, for whom McCarthy served as a staffer from 1987 through 2002, excoriated McCarthy for his failure to accept the result of the 2020 presidential election and unwillingness to fully confront Trump for his role in precipitating and maintaining the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.[40]\nIn May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, McCarthy and House Republicans filed a lawsuit to stop the House of Representatives from allowing remote proxy voting by representatives, a measure that had been introduced under Speaker Nancy Pelosi to prevent the virus's spread in the Capitol.[83][84] McCarthy and the other plaintiffs claimed that a quorum of members had to be physically present in the chamber to conduct business; Pelosi defended the rule as a critical public health measure and pointed to the Constitution authorizing each chamber of Congress to establish its own procedural rules.[84] In August 2020, a federal judge dismissed McCarthy's lawsuit against Pelosi, ruling that the House has \"absolute immunity from civil suit\" under the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause.[84]\n\nMcCarthy with other congressional leaders in January 2020In November 2020, in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, McCarthy insisted on Laura Ingraham's television show that \"President Trump won this election\"\u2014echoing Trump's own claim\u2014even as vote-counting was ongoing in several states and no winner had yet been declared.[85][86] McCarthy insinuated that large-scale voter fraud would lead Trump to lose, saying \"Everyone who is listening: Do not be quiet. Do not be silent about this. We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes.\"[87][88]\nIn December 2020, McCarthy was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election.[89] House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of \"election subversion\".[90][91] The Supreme Court declined to hear the case, on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.[92][93][94] In March 2021, McCarthy denied he had supported Trump's false claims of election fraud, despite having supported Texas v. Pennsylvania.[95]\nOn January 6, 2021, hours after the attack on the Capitol, McCarthy voted against certifying Biden's win in two states.[96][97] Cook Political Report House editor Dave Wasserman later reported that McCarthy had told him on several occasions before this vote that he knew Biden had won.[98][99] He later denied that this was a vote to overturn the election, because Biden would still have won without those two states. McCarthy finally recognized Biden as president-elect on January 8, more than two months after the election.[100]\nDuring a January 8 conference call with other House Republican leaders, McCarthy said that Trump's conduct during the Capitol riot was \"atrocious and totally wrong\" and that he was \"inciting people\" to attack the Capitol, and briefly inquired about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. On a January 10 conference call with Republican leaders, McCarthy said he would ask Trump to resign rather than go through a long impeachment battle, adding, \"I've had it with this guy.\" During the same call he also expressed a wish that tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter would strip some Republican lawmakers of their social media accounts. But after weak House Republican support for Trump's second impeachment, fearing retribution from Trump and his allies, McCarthy backed off from this stance.[101]\nA week after the attack, McCarthy delivered a speech in which he held Trump partially responsible for the riots. He emphasized that Trump failed to intervene after the initial TV footage, showing the demonstration evolving in a violent assault.[102] He later said that he did not believe Trump had provoked the mob. On January 28, McCarthy paid Trump a visit at his Mar-a-Lago residence. Officially the topic was said to be \"regaining the lost votes in the midterm elections of 2022\", but it was widely reported as an attempt to mend fences with Trump and lessen tensions in the Republican Party.[8][9]\nDuring the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler said that Trump said to McCarthy during the ongoing attack on the Capitol by rioters: \"Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.\"[103] She was not called as a witness but her statement was included in the impeachment documents.\nIn April 2021, before closing arguments in the Derek Chauvin trial, Maxine Waters said, \"I hope we're going to get a verdict that will say guilty, guilty, guilty. And if we don't, we cannot go away\" and need to get \"more confrontational\". After her comments, McCarthy said, \"Waters is inciting violence in Minneapolis just as she has incited it in the past. If Speaker Pelosi doesn't act against this dangerous rhetoric, I will bring action this week.\"[104][105][106][107]\nBecause of her stance on the Capitol riot, her vote to impeach Trump and vocal opposition to his stolen election narrative, in early 2021 pro-Trump Freedom Caucus House members attempted to remove Liz Cheney as chair of the House Republican Conference, the third-ranking position in the Republican House leadership. The initial effort failed, but growing numbers of House Republicans supported her removal; McCarthy agreed to a party vote in May, resulting in Cheney's ouster. Hours after the vote, McCarthy said, \"I don't think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election\", but a CNN poll released days earlier found that 70% of Republicans believed the election was stolen.[108][109][110][111][112][113] In October 2021, McCarthy pressured Republican political consultants not to work with Cheney or else lose business with other Republicans.[114]\n\nMcCarthy, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, and Nancy Pelosi meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in May 2021.\nOn May 18, 2021, McCarthy announced that he opposed the bipartisan agreement in the House to form an independent commission to investigate the Capitol attack. McCarthy had asked Representative John Katko, a member of his whip team, to negotiate with Democrats on the caucus's behalf about the commission. McCarthy specified to Katko what he and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wanted, and got almost everything he asked for.[115] McCarthy also said that the scope of any investigation should include other events of political violence, which was possible with the terms negotiated. McCarthy sided with other Republicans who sought to downplay the matter and move on.[116] In June 2021, after Pelosi announced the creation of a select committee to investigate the Capitol attack that would include five Republican members, McCarthy threatened to remove Republicans from committee assignments if they participated.[117]\nIn July 2021, the delta variant of the coronavirus prompted the Attending Physician of the United States Congress to reimpose a mask requirement in the House chamber. McCarthy called this \"a decision conjured up by liberal government officials who want to continue to live in a perpetual pandemic state\", prompting Pelosi to respond to reporters, \"he's such a moron.\"[118][119] On July 31, 2021, members of Tennessee's Republican congressional delegation gave McCarthy a large gavel with the words \"Fire Pelosi\" inscribed on it. McCarthy told them, \"it will be hard not to hit her with it, but I will bang it down.\"[120]\nIn August 2021, after the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack asked telecommunications and social media companies to retain certain records, McCarthy said that if the companies \"turn over private information\" to the committee, they would be \"in violation of federal law and subject to losing their ability to operate in the United States\", and that a future Republican legislative majority would hold them \"fully accountable\". McCarthy did not specify which law the companies would break in this situation.[121]\nOn November 18, 2021, and into the early morning of November 19, McCarthy gave a record-breaking 8.5-hour speech on the House floor using the \"magic minute\", forcing a delay in the final vote on the Build Back Better Act.[122]\nOn May 12, 2022, the January 6 Committee subpoenaed McCarthy and Republican representatives Jim Jordan, Mo Brooks, Scott Perry and Andy Biggs.[123] In December, the committee referred McCarthy, Jordan, Perry and Biggs to the House Ethics Committee for disobeying the subpoenas.[124][125]\n\nSpeaker of the House[edit]\nNomination[edit]\nMain article: January 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election\nMcCarthy holding the gavel following the 15 ballots that led to his election as Speaker of the House\nAs minority leader, McCarthy led Republicans in the 2022 election cycle. Many party officials and political pundits predicted Republicans would make large gains in the House. In the elections, Republicans gained a majority, continuing the decades-long trend of the incumbent president's party losing a House majority in their midterm elections. This also marked the first time since the 115th Congress that Republicans held a majority. But Republicans did not fulfill widespread predictions of large gains, as their majority was narrow. McCarthy won an internal Republican conference vote in early November, with 188 votes to Andy Biggs's 31, but some members of the conference continued to oppose his bid for speaker.\nAt the start of the 118th Congress on January 3, 2023, McCarthy failed to secure a majority of votes cast on the first ballot, with all Democrats and 19 Republicans opposing him. This marked the first time since the December 1923 speaker election that the first ballot did not produce a speaker. McCarthy finally received a majority and became speaker on the 15th ballot on January 7, after making key concessions to some members of the right-wing Freedom Caucus,[126][127] including a rule to allow a single House member to introduce a vote to remove the speaker, as well as granting Freedom Caucus members three seats on the influential Rules Committee.[128] Additionally, it was the longest multi-ballot speaker election since 1859.[129][130]\n\nTenure[edit]\nSpeaker McCarthy greets U.S. President Joe Biden before the 2023 State of the Union Address.\nIn February 2023, McCarthy released over 40,000 hours of security video of the January 6 Capitol attack to Fox News host Tucker Carlson, prompting criticism from colleagues such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.[131] Days later, Carlson aired several minutes of the video during his program and asserted that government investigators had exaggerated the degree of criminality during the attack. Justice Department prosecutors said that in one case Carlson's video clips were misleadingly edited to suggest that one prominent Capitol intruder had been unjustly prosecuted, omitting video of him engaged in criminal activity.[132][133]\n\nSpeaker McCarthy meets with President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen, April 5, 2023.\nIn March 2023, McCarthy announced he had planned a meeting with the Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen, in the U.S.[134] He initially declined an invitation from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit Ukraine, saying he opposed giving \"blank checks\" to Ukraine and did not need to visit Ukraine to know whether the money was necessary.[135] The planned meeting with Tsai was condemned by the Chinese Communist Party, which threatened to take strong action.[136] McCarthy and Tsai met on April 5 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library,[137] where he denounced China's threats.[138] The meeting, which was described as a historic first,[139][140] triggered a series of Chinese military exercises near Taiwan, which the People's Liberation Army described as three-day \"combat readiness patrols\", meant to warn to the Taiwanese. On April 8, approximately eight Chinese warships and 42 fighter jets were detected near Taiwan's coasts.[141][142][143]\nIn April 2023, McCarthy, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell invited South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol to address a joint meeting of Congress, scheduled for April 27.[144]\nIn May 2023, amid a debt-ceiling crisis, McCarthy worked closely with President Biden to resolve the issue.[145][146] Members of the Freedom Caucus attempted to persuade McCarthy to make more robust demands in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, but with days until a potentially disastrous default, McCarthy did not do so.[147][148] He negotiated the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 that was introduced by Republican representative Patrick McHenry, and it passed the House on May 31 and the Senate on June 1. Biden signed it into law on June 3, ending the crisis and preventing a default.[149]\n\nMcCarthy and Vice President Kamala Harris behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he addresses Congress, June 22, 2023\nMcCarthy has urged Biden to withdraw the nomination of Julie Su as United States secretary of labor, arguing her controversial record would lead to \"potential disastrous ramifications at the federal level\".[150]\nMcCarthy has expressed support for a proposal to \"expunge\" both of President Trump's impeachments.[151]\nAmid allegations of corruption by President Joe Biden, many Republicans called for his impeachment. On September 1, 2023, McCarthy said that he would not initiate an impeachment inquiry without a full House vote, though it appeared he did not have sufficient Republican support to pass such a measure.[152][153] On September 12, he announced that he was directing the Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means committees to begin an impeachment inquiry, to be led by James Comer, chairman of the Oversight Committee. He did not say whether a full House vote might be held.[154] McCarthy asserted that, over his objections, former speaker Nancy Pelosi had changed the process when Democrats pursued the first impeachment of Donald Trump in 2019, so that he was following what she had done. In 2019, Democrats conducted a five-week investigation before holding a full House vote to approve an impeachment inquiry.[155][156]\nThe impeachment allegations coincided with rising fears of a federal government shutdown, as McCarthy's concessions to Biden infuriated members of the Freedom Caucus, who called for less spending. The Freedom Caucus's cause was echoed by various politicians outside the House, notably including Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Amid the Republican infighting and in a push to halt legislators' pay during shutdowns, Representative Angie Craig introduced the MCCARTHY (My Constituents Cannot Afford Rebellious Tantrums, Handle Your) Shutdown Act.[157][158]\n\nRemoval as House Speaker[edit]\nMain article: Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House\nMcCarthy giving a press conference following his removal\nOn September 29, 2023, McCarthy's bill to fund the federal government, including large spending cuts and strict border policies, failed to pass the House after Democrats and 21 hard-right House Republicans refused to support it; if no funding bill had been passed, a government shutdown would have occurred on October 1.[159][160] On September 30, McCarthy introduced a temporary funding bill without the large spending cuts, but also without Ukraine funding; this bill passed the House with 209 Democrats and 126 Republicans in favor; one Democrat and 90 Republicans voted against it.[161] The shutdown was prevented when the Senate passed the bill and President Biden signed it into law.[160] McCarthy told the media, \"Democrats tried to do everything they can not to let [the bill] pass\".[162]\nAfter funding the government with Democratic support, McCarthy said, \"If somebody wants to remove me because I want to be the adult in the room, go ahead and try\".[160] On October 3, Representative Matt Gaetz filed a motion to vacate the speakership out of frustration with McCarthy working with Democrats. Immediately after, an attempt to remove the motion through a motion to table was filed by Representative Tom Cole, a McCarthy ally, but it was voted down by House Democrats and eleven Republicans.[163] The vote to vacate passed with 216 in favor and 210 opposed, removing McCarthy as speaker.[164] This was the first time in U.S. history that the House of Representatives had removed its speaker from office.[165][166] Voting to remove McCarthy were all House Democrats and eight House Republicans: Gaetz, Andy Biggs, Ken Buck, Tim Burchett, Eli Crane, Bob Good, Nancy Mace, and Matt Rosendale.[167] After the vote, McCarthy announced he would not seek the speakership again.[168] On October 26, 2023, the newly elected Speaker Mike Johnson called him \"Speaker Emeritus\".[169]\n\nPost-speakership and resignation from Congress[edit]\nOn December 6, 2023, McCarthy announced that he would resign from Congress on December 31.[20] On December 14, McCarthy gave his farewell speech to the House; speaking to reporters, he said that leaving the House at this point in his career was \"not the timing I wanted\". Republican members of California's congressional delegation, in addition to Patrick McHenry and Democrat Steny Hoyer, paid tribute to McCarthy on the House floor.[170]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMcCarthy and his wife Judy with their children during the 110th Congressional swearing in\nMcCarthy and his wife, Judy, have two children. They are lifelong residents of Bakersfield.[34] He and his family are Baptists and members of the Southern Baptist Convention.[171]\nIn October 2015, McCarthy was accused of having an affair with Representative Renee Ellmers.[172] He had unexpectedly dropped out of the race for Speaker of the House shortly before the allegations surfaced.[173][174] Days earlier, Representative Walter B. Jones Jr. had sent Republican Conference chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers a letter stating that any candidates for a leadership position with \"misdeeds\" should withdraw from the race.[77] Both McCarthy and Ellmers have denied the allegation.[172]\n\nSee also[edit]\nPolitical positions of Kevin McCarthy\nElectoral history of Kevin McCarthy\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ A multi-ballot election lasted for 4 days, with McCarthy assuming office on January 7. House Clerk Cheryl Johnson served as the acting presiding officer pursuant to the previous rules of the House.\n\n^ Following McCarthy's removal as speaker on October 3, 2023, Patrick McHenry acted as speaker pro tempore until Johnson's election as speaker on October 25, 2023.\n\n^ Theodore M. Pomeroy (one day) and Michael C. Kerr (258 days) served shorter terms than McCarthy.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise vault into GOP leadership\". Politico.

    "wiki": "American author and columnist\n\n\nKirsten PowersBornKirsten Anne Powers (1967-12-14) December 14, 1967 (age\u00a056)NationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of MarylandOccupationColumnistEmployerNewsweekPolitical partyDemocratic\nKirsten Anne Powers[1] (born December 14, 1967) is an American author, liberal columnist, and political analyst.[2] She currently writes for USA Today, and is an on-air political analyst at CNN, where she appears regularly on Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0, , and The Lead with Jake Tapper. The Washington Post called her \"bright-eyed, sharp-tongued, [and] gamely combative\".[3] The New Republic noted Powers \"held her own in any debate\" at Fox News and quoted columnist Erik Wemple, who called her \"a ferocious advocate for her points of view\".[4]\nPrior to CNN, Powers worked at Fox News as a political analyst and contributor,[5] where she appeared regularly across the channel including Special Report with Bret Baier, Fox News Sunday, The Kelly File and The O'Reilly Factor.  The Columbia Journalism Review described her as \"an outspoken liberal journalist\".[6] Mediaite deemed her \"Fox's liberal to be reckoned with.\"\nPowers previously was a columnist for the New York Post, and later The Daily Beast, which she left to join USA Today. Powers' first column appeared at The American Prospect, and her numerous articles have appeared in USA Today, Elle, the New York Observer, Salon, and the Wall Street Journal.\nPowers began her career as a staff assistant with the Clinton-Gore presidential transition team in 1992, followed by an appointment as Deputy Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Public Affairs in the Clinton administration from 1993 to 1998. She subsequently worked in various roles, including press secretary, communications consultant and party consultant.[7]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nPowers' parents were archaeologists, with Irish-American heritage.[7][8][9][10] She credits her interest in politics and debate with being \"expected to state and defend my positions on the issues of the day every night at dinner\".[8]\nShe graduated from Monroe Catholic High School in Fairbanks, Alaska in 1986[1] and the University of Maryland and attended Georgetown University Law Center for a year and a half.\n\nCareer[edit]\nPowers served in the Clinton administration as the deputy assistant U.S. trade representative for public affairs.\nShe left to become the vice president for international communications at America Online.[5] After AOL's merger with Time Warner, she became a vice president at the AOL-Time Warner Foundation.\nPowers has worked in New York State Democratic politics for many years. She was a consultant of the New York State Democratic Committee, the press secretary for the Andrew Cuomo for Governor campaign, and communications director on the mayoral campaign of C. Virginia Fields. She also worked on the \"Vote No on 3\" campaign, which overwhelmingly defeated New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's ballot initiative to eliminate party primaries. Powers also was press secretary for Donnie Fowler's unsuccessful bid to be Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair. She has consulted for a variety of non-profit organizations, including Human Rights First and the National Council for Research on Women (NCRW).[5]\nIn 2015, she authored The Silencing: How the Left is Killing Free Speech, which was published by Regnery Press.\nIn July 2017, Powers criticized CNN's decision to not identify a controversial Reddit user, asking in a USA Today article: \"What about the people he routinely dehumanizes and degrades online?\"[11] But, she wrote, she ultimately supported CNN's decision to not identify the user because they determined his safety might have been jeopardized. Powers also wrote on Twitter that \"people do not have a 'right' to stay anonymous so they can spew their racist, misogynist, homophobic garbage\".[12]\nIn January 2019 Powers was criticized and, in her own words, \"harassed\" on Twitter, after she blamed Covington Catholic High School students for \"disrespecting an Indigenous elder\" during a highly publicized confrontation that occurred at the Lincoln Memorial on January 18, 2019.[13]\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nPowers supports universal health care.[14] Thus, she initially supported President Barack Obama's health care reform, but later became critical of its implementation. She later opined: \"A lot of people who have really been screwed over by the law [and] are left without insurance or with extremely expensive insurance\", and agreed with a Ron Fournier headline in National Journal, \"Why I'm getting tired of defending Obamacare.\"[15]\nIn 2009, Powers urged the Obama administration to repeal \"Don't ask, don't tell\" as \"refusing the service of people like Lt. Daniel Choi[...]an Arabic linguist \u2014 a specialty in enormously short supply \u2014 who deployed to Iraq and was willing to deploy again\" harmed national security.[16] A year earlier, she had accused the Republican Party of using homophobia for political gain.[17]\nPowers opposed the Fairness Doctrine,[18] and a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.[19] She also supports comprehensive immigration reform and providing a path to citizenship for illegal aliens, and favors gun control.[20] She also supports closing Guantanamo Bay, and transferring its prisoners to federal prisons.[21]\nIn 2011, Powers criticized Americans' lack of concern about the Muslim Brotherhood rising to power in Egypt as \"naivete\". Her concern partly derived from her then-husband Marty Makary being of Coptic origin.[22]\nPowers described her ideal foreign policy as one of limited engagement, in which the U.S. refrained from intervening in tenuous situations it may not be able to control, or even understand. She even went on to state that she is not an isolationist.[23] Powers was critical of Obama's foreign policy, going so far as to say to Bill O'Reilly: \"Yeah, he should have given it [the Nobel Peace prize] back a long time ago, actually. But, you know, for the drone war, for the escalating the war in Afghanistan, having all these people die unnecessarily, plenty of civilians have been killed by his drone war, including children.\"[24] In a separate interview she further stated, \"I've been so disappointed with Obama on his foreign policy, and it's compounded with the way the national Democrats have enabled it, especially after the way they behaved about Bush. It's more like institutional Democrats, who have rallied around assassinating an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, the drone war, escalating the war in Afghanistan, which is a complete disaster, the civil liberties \u2014 things that if Bush were doing them, everybody would be hysterical. To me it's shown that they're not that serious about human rights and issues they've been aligned with.\"[23]\nPowers has written opinion pieces against elective late-term abortions.[25][26] However, in May 2019, she expressed regret for writing those pieces. She clarified that \"[d]octors, not the government, should be helping women decide what to do in these situations\", such as pregnancies that endanger the woman's life. She added that she \"care[s] about all lives, and that includes the lives of women contemplating abortion\".[27]\nIn February 2019, Powers publicly apologized for having been \"too judgmental and condemning\" in her statements on social media and in the press. She stated that, when criticizing others for poor behavior, she had not properly acknowledged \"the humanity of everyone involved\". She stated, \"People should not be treated as disposable and banished in perpetuity with no path to restoration with society.\" She also apologized for the tone of her 2015 book The Silencing: How the Left is Killing Free Speech, writing that it was \"too dismissive of real concerns by traumatized people and groups who feel marginalized and ignored\".[28]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nPowers was raised as an Episcopalian but spent much of her early adult life as an atheist. In her mid-30s, she became an  evangelical Christian. The process of conversion began when she dated a Christian man, who introduced her to the Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City and the teachings of its pastor, Tim Keller, and culminated in an experience on a trip to Taiwan in 2006, where she later wrote she \"woke up in what felt like a strange cross between a dream and reality. Jesus came to me and said, 'Here I am.'\"[9] She has called her conversion \"a bit of a mind bender\" due to her political beliefs and former atheism, and prefers the term \"orthodox Christian\" over \"evangelical\" to describe herself, given the cultural baggage around the latter term.[29] She has said that the biggest impact her new-found faith had on her political beliefs was that she came to \"view everyone as God's child, and that means everyone deserves grace and respect\".[8][20] On October 10, 2015, Powers was received into the Catholic Church.[30][31]\nOn November 16, 2016, Powers announced her engagement to fellow journalist Robert Draper.[32][33]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"29 Graduates Bid Farewell to Monroe\".
