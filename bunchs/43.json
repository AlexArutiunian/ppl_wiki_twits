He is a member of the Republican Party and serves as the chairman of the House Rules Committee. During his tenure as the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) from 2007 to 2009, he was the fourth-ranking Republican in the House.\nA member of the Chickasaw Nation, Cole is one of five Native Americans in Congress who are enrolled tribal members. The others are fellow Republicans Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma (Cherokee) and Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma (Choctaw), and Democrats Sharice Davids of Kansas (Ho\u2011Chunk) and Mary Peltola of Alaska (Yupik). In 2022, Cole became the longest-serving Native American in the history of Congress.[1][2]\n\n\nEarly life, education, and academic career[edit]\nCole was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the son of John D. Cole and Helen Te Ata (n\u00e9e Gale), who was the first Native American elected to the Oklahoma Senate.[2][3] They returned to Oklahoma, where family on both sides lived. His ancestors had been in the territory for five generations, and he was raised in Moore, halfway between Oklahoma City and Norman.[citation needed]\nCole graduated from Grinnell College in 1971 with a B.A. in history. His postgraduate degrees include an M.A. from Yale University (1974) and a Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma (1984), both in British history. Cole's Ph.D. thesis was Life and Labor in the Isle of Dogs: The Origins and Evolution of an East London Working-Class Community, 1800\u20131980. He did research abroad as a Thomas J. Watson Fellow and was a Fulbright Fellow (1977\u201378) at the University of London. He served as an assistant professor in history and politics in college before entering politics and winning political office.[citation needed]\n\nEarly political career[edit]\nFollowing his mother, who served as a state representative and senator, Cole was elected to the Oklahoma Senate in 1988, serving until 1991. He chaired the Oklahoma Republican Party for much of the 1980s. He resigned from the state senate mid-term to accept an appointment as executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. From 1995 to 1999, he served as Oklahoma's Secretary of State, appointed by Governor Frank Keating. He assisted with the recovery efforts after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.[citation needed]\nBuilding on his involvement in national politics, Cole resigned from Keating's administration when asked to become chief of staff to the Republican National Committee.[4][5]\nCole spent two years working as a paid consultant for the United States Chamber of Commerce, but his primary effort in politics was as a political consultant for candidates. Along with partners Sharon Hargrave Caldwell and Deby Snodgrass, his firm (Cole, Hargrave, Snodgrass and Associates) played a large part in strengthening the Republican Party in Oklahoma. He backed a number of candidates who were elected to office during the Republican Revolution of 1994, when it gained dominance in the state. Among their clients have been Keating, J. C. Watts, Tom Coburn, Frank Lucas, Mary Fallin, Wes Watkins, Steve Largent, Chip Pickering, and Linda Lingle.[citation needed]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives[edit]\nCole shaking hands with President Donald Trump in February 2020\nElections[edit]\nDuring his initial campaign for the House of Representatives in 2002, Cole received the endorsement of Watts, the popular outgoing congressman. This helped him win the general election over Democratic nominee and former Oklahoma State Senator Darryl Roberts, with 53.8% of the vote to Roberts's 46.1%. Cole has won at least 63% of the vote in each of his eight reelection campaigns, and he ran unopposed in 2010.[citation needed]\n\nTenure[edit]\nFollowing the 2006 election cycle, the members of the House Republican Conference elected Cole to the post of NRCC Chairman, placing him in charge of national efforts to assist Republican candidates for Congress.[citation needed]\nCole has established a solidly conservative voting record in the House. He has consistently voted anti-abortion and for gun rights. He also has pro-business positions, supporting free trade, the military, veterans, and educating other congressmen on American Indian issues. He favors loosening immigration restrictions and imposing stricter limits on campaign funds. In 2012, he sponsored H.R. 5912, which would prohibit public funds from being used for political party conventions. This legislation passed the House in September but awaits action by the Senate.[6] During his tenure, Cole has been a leading voice for strengthening protections for Native American women under the Violence Against Women Act.[2]\nIn June 2013, after another failure of the United States farm bill in Congress, Cole called the failure inexcusable. His district in Oklahoma includes some of the state's farming communities, and if the Farm Bill passed, it would have saved $40 billion over a ten-year period.[7]\nAs chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Cole was responsible for introducing the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4487; 113th Congress).[8] The bill would appropriate $3.3 billion to the legislative branch for FY 2015, about the same amount it received in FY 2014.[9] According to Cole, the bill meets its goals \"in both an effective and efficient manner, and has done so in a genuinely bipartisan, inclusive and deliberative fashion.\"[10]\nIn 2013, Cole introduced the Home School Equity Act for Tax Relief. The bill would allow some homeschool parents to take tax credits for purchasing classroom materials.[11]\nCole expressed his intention in 2018 to push his Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act into the spending bill as an omnibus. The bill would \"make clear that the National Labor Relations Board has no jurisdiction over businesses owned and operated by an Indian tribe and located on tribal land.\"[12]\nThe Lugar Center ranked Cole the 91st most bipartisan member of the House during the 114th United States Congress.[13]\n\n2016 House speakership election[edit]\nIn the contest for House Speaker that followed the resignation of John Boehner, Cole supported the claims of Paul Ryan, saying:\n\"Anyone who attacks Paul Ryan as being insufficiently conservative is either woefully misinformed or maliciously destructive...Paul Ryan has played a major role in advancing the conservative cause and creating the Republican House majority. His critics are not true conservatives. They are radical populists who neither understand nor accept the institutions, procedures and traditions that are the basis of constitutional governance.\"[14]\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nCole supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.[15]\nIn January 2021, Cole voted against the certification of the Electoral College results in the 2020 presidential election.[16] He subsequently voluntarily gave up an honorary degree from Grinnell College.[17] In May 2021, Cole voted against the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6 insurrection.[18]\nIn 2021, Cole joined a majority of Republican representatives in signing onto an amicus brief to overturn Roe v. Wade.[19] Following the Supreme Court's decision to overrule Roe in June 2022, Cole celebrated the outcome, saying in part \"not only is this a monumental win for states\u2019 rights, but also the rights of unborn children.\"[20]\nCole voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.[21][22]\n\nIraq[edit]\nIn June 2021, Cole was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.[23][24]\n\nBig Tech[edit]\nIn 2022, Cole was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.[25][26]\n\nCommittee memberships[edit]\nCommittee on Appropriations (Vice Ranking Member)\nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)\nSubcommittee on Defense\nSubcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies\nCommittee on the Budget\nCommittee on Rules (chair)\nCaucus membership[edit]\nRepublican Study Committee[27]\nElectoral history[edit]\n\nOklahoma's 4th congressional district: Results 2002\u20132022[28]\n\n\nYear\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nVotes\n\nPct\n\n\n\nDemocrat\n\nVotes\n\nPct\n\n\n\n3rd Party\n\nParty\n\nVotes\n\nPct\n\n\n2002\n\n\n\nTom Cole\n\n106,452\n\n53.83%\n\n\n\nDarryl Roberts\n\n91,322\n\n46.17%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\n\n\nTom Cole (incumbent)\n\n198,985\n\n77.77%\n\n\n\n(no candidate)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlene K.

He attended St John's School, Leatherhead for secondary school/high school before attaining a BA in War Studies from King's College London, an MSc in Middle Eastern Politics from the School of Oriental and African Studies,[1] and a Graduate Diploma in Law from The College of Law in London.[2]\nThough he grew up in the United Kingdom, his political career began in the United States when he worked as an intern in Washington, D.C., during the 2004 US Presidential Campaign. He also had a short stint working for a British Member of Parliament, Humfrey Malins, during 2005.\nHis first television appearances were in the United Kingdom, as a commentator on US and international politics on news outlets such as BBC and Sky News during the 2012 US Presidential Election.[3] In 2012 he moved to Washington, D.C.\nHe has contributed to news organisations, including The Week, The Spectator, The Weekly Standard, Reuters, The American Spectator, The Daily Caller, Fox News, The Washington Times, USA Today, CNN, The Christian Science Monitor, The Atlantic, The Commentator, The Telegraph,[4] The Guardian [5] and The Huffington Post.[6] He is a columnist for the National Review[7] and Opportunity Lives.[8] In 2014, he began making increasingly frequent TV appearances as a pundit/commentator on news outlets such as Fox News and CNN.[6] A specialist in Middle-Eastern politics and US foreign policy, he featured regularly as a commentator on various news outlets during the initial uprising of ISIS in 2014, occasionally making multiple TV appearances a day. He has appeared twice on the HBO show, Real Time with Bill Maher.\nIn August 2014 he was chosen as the inaugural chair of the \u2018Tony Blankley Chair for Public Policy and American Exceptionalism\u2019 award by the Steamboat Institute,[6] a conservative political group based in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, in memory of political analyst Tony Blankley.\nIn 2014 he was a frequent guest panelist on The McLaughlin Group,[3] becoming a regular panelist in 2015.[9] He became a mentee of John McLaughlin and the two developed a very close relationship. At John McLaughlin's funeral, Rogan was one of the first speakers [10] and maintains a close relationship with the McLaughlin family.[11]\nIn 2017, Rogan joined the Washington Examiner [12] as a commentary writer.\nIn August 2017, a pilot episode of a proposed revival of The McLaughlin Group with Rogan as moderator was taped and published on YouTube. On January 8, 2018, The McLaughlin Group relaunched[13] with Rogan as moderator. In contrast to the previous format in which there were four semi-permanent panelists, the new version features a rotating guest each week. The show aired on WJLA-TV, the local ABC affiliate for the greater Washington, D.C. area,[14] for a few months, then became available online only. After going into hiatus in January 2019, the show returned to the air, with Rogan as moderator and the same format, in September 2019 on Maryland Public Television, which began distribution of the show to PBS stations nationally in January 2020.[15][16] In November 2019, the show introduced a \"Web Exclusive\" moderated by Rogan and available online, consisting of additional discussions not included in the weekly television broadcast.[17]\n\nArticle about the Crimean Bridge[edit]\nOn May 15, 2018 Tom published an article in the newspaper Washington Examiner titled \"Ukraine should blow up Putin's Crimea bridge\".[18] In his article, Rogan says that the Ukrainian air force should bomb the Crimean Bridge, and that the US should support this.  He also claims that the length of the bridge would reduce the number of casualties among those crossing at the time of the attack. The article provoked a strong reaction in Russia, instantly turning the Washington Examiner into the most frequently cited periodical. Many spoke about the article, including the Vice Speaker of the Russian Parliament Irina Yarovaya; and the Russian Embassy to the United States demanded an explanation from Tom Rogan. On 17 May, the Investigative Committee of Russia opened a criminal investigation against Tom Rogan, accusing him of calling for terrorism.[19] Tom Rogan reacted with his new article in Washington Examiner titled \"Why Putin wants to send me to the Black Dolphin\"[20] and he received support in the editorial \"Our response to Russia's threats against our journalists\". In the latter it was stated, that Rogan's piece is \"an opinion on how one sovereign nation ought to respond to aggression\".[21] On May 18, the Investigative Committee opened criminal case against the editor of the Washington Examiner, Hugo Gurdon, too.[22]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Tom Rogan. \"Tom Rogan\". the Guardian.

Since his contract with Fox News was terminated, he has hosted Tucker on X. An advocate of former U.S. president Donald Trump, Carlson has been described as \"perhaps the highest-profile proponent of 'Trumpism'\",[5] and as \"the most influential voice in right-wing media, without a close second.\"[6]\nCarlson began his media career in the 1990s, writing for The Weekly Standard and other publications. He was a CNN commentator from 2000 to 2005 and a co-host of Crossfire, the network's prime-time news debate program, from 2001 to 2005. From 2005 to 2008, he hosted the nightly program Tucker on MSNBC. In 2009, he became a political analyst for Fox News, appearing on various programs before launching his own show. In 2010, Carlson co-founded and served as the initial editor-in-chief of the right-wing news and opinion website The Daily Caller, until selling his ownership stake and leaving in 2020.[7] He has written three books: Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites (2003), Ship of Fools (2018), and The Long Slide (2021).\nDescribed as a leading voice of white grievance politics,[8][9][10][11] Carlson is known for circulating far-right ideas into mainstream politics and discourse.[10][11][12][13] He has promoted conspiracy theories on topics such as demographic replacement,[14][15][11] COVID-19,[16][17] the January 6 United States Capitol attack,[18][19] and Ukrainian bioweapons;[20][21] and has been noted for false and misleading statements about these and other topics.[10][11][19][22][23] Carlson's remarks on race, immigration, and women\u00a0\u2013 including slurs he said on air between 2006 and 2011 (which resurfaced in 2019)[24][25]\u00a0\u2013 have at times been described as racist and sexist, and provoked advertiser boycotts of Tucker Carlson Tonight.[26][27][28] One of the most watched United States cable news shows,[29] Fox News dismissed Carlson in April 2023 and cancelled Tucker Carlson Tonight,[30][31] without providing a reason.[32][33][34][35] In June, he began posting a show on Twitter called Tucker on Twitter, which was rebranded as Tucker on X after the site changed its name.[36][37]\nCarlson is a frequent critic of immigration.[38] Formerly an economic libertarian, he now supports protectionism.[1][39] In 2004, he renounced his initial support for the Iraq War,[40][41] and has since been skeptical of U.S. foreign interventions.[1][42] He was said to have influenced some of Trump's decisions as president, including the cancellation of a military strike against Iran in 2019, the firing of John Bolton as National Security Advisor  the same year, and the commutation of Roger Stone's prison sentence in 2020, and would criticize Trump when he believed he was straying from \"Trumpism\".[43][44][45][46][47]\n\n\nEarly life and education\nCarlson at the Buckley School in 1975\nCarlson was born Tucker McNear Carlson at the Children's Hospital in  San Francisco, California, on May 16, 1969.[48][11] He is the elder son of artist and San Francisco native Lisa McNear[49] (n\u00e9e\u00a0Lombardi) (1945\u20132011) and Dick Carlson (1941\u2013), a former \"gonzo reporter\"[2][50][51] who became the director of Voice of America, president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and U.S. ambassador to the Seychelles,[52] and more recently a director at the lobbying firm Policy Impact Strategic Communications.[53] Carlson's brother, Buckley Peck Carlson, later Buckley Swanson Peck Carlson, is nearly two years younger[54] and has worked as a communications manager and Republican political operative.[55][56]\nCarlson's paternal grandparents were Richard Boynton and Dorothy Anderson, who were teenagers when they placed his father at The Home for Little Wanderers orphanage, where he was fostered by Carl Moberger of Malden, near Boston, a tannery worker of Swedish descent, and his wife Florence Moberger.[57][50][58][59] Carlson's father was adopted at the age of two by upper-middle-class New Englanders, the Carlsons, an executive at the Winslow Brothers & Smith Tannery of Norwood (the oldest tannery in America) and his wife.[58]\nCarlson's maternal great-great-great-grandfather was Henry Miller, the \"Cattle King\".[60] Carlson's maternal great-great-grandfather Cesar Lombardi immigrated to New York from Switzerland in 1860.[61][62] Carlson is also a distant relative of Massachusetts politicians Ebenezer R. Hoar and George M. Brooks.[54] Carlson himself was named after his great-great-great-grandfather Dr. J.\u00a0C. Tucker and his great-great-grandfather George W. McNear.[63][64] Carlson is of one thirty-second Italian-Swiss ancestry.[62][65]\nIn 1976, Carlson's parents divorced after the nine-year marriage reportedly \"turned sour\".[54][66] Carlson's father was granted custody of Tucker and his brother. Carlson's mother left the family when he was six and moved to France. The boys never saw her again.[3][52]\nWhen Carlson was in first grade, his father moved Tucker and his brother to the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, and raised them there.[67][68] Carlson attended La Jolla Country Day School and grew up in a home overlooking the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club.[69] His father owned property in Nevada, Vermont, and islands in Maine and Nova Scotia.[50][69] In 1984, his father unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Republican Mayor Roger Hedgecock in the San Diego mayoral race.[70]\nIn 1979, Carlson's father married Patricia Caroline Swanson, an heiress to Swanson Enterprises, daughter of Gilbert Carl Swanson and niece of Senator J. William Fulbright.[52][71] Though Patricia remained a beneficiary of the family fortune, the Swansons had sold the brand to the Campbell Soup Company in 1955 and did not own it by the time of Carlson's father's marriage.[72] This was the third marriage for Swanson, who legally adopted Tucker Carlson and his brother.[71][73]\nCarlson was briefly enrolled at Coll\u00e8ge du L\u00e9man, a boarding school in the canton of Geneva in French-speaking Switzerland, but said he was \"kicked out\".[74] He attained his secondary education at St. George's School, a boarding school in Middletown, Rhode Island, where he started dating his future wife, Susan Andrews, the headmaster's daughter.[75] He then spent four years attending Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut.[52] Carlson's Trinity yearbook describes him as a member of the \"Dan White Society\", an apparent reference to the American political assassin who murdered San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk.[76][77][78] Despite being listed as a member of the class of 1992, Carlson did not complete enough credits to graduate and did not receive a diploma.[79] After college, Carlson tried to join the Central Intelligence Agency, but his application was denied, after which he decided to pursue a career in journalism with the encouragement of his father, who advised him that \"they'll take anybody\".[52][80]\n\nMedia career\nCarlson began his career in journalism as a fact-checker for Policy Review,[52] a national conservative journal then published by The Heritage Foundation and later acquired by the Hoover Institution. He then worked as an opinion writer at the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper in Little Rock, Arkansas, before joining The Weekly Standard news magazine in 1995.[52][81][82] Writer Andrew Ferguson, who served as senior editor of The Weekly Standard said that Carlson \"had as much talent as anybody who ever came through the door.\"[83] Carlson sought a role with the publication after hearing of its founding, fearing he would be \"written off as a wing nut\" if he instead joined The American Spectator.[75]\nIn 1999, Carlson interviewed then-Governor George W. Bush for Talk magazine. He quoted Bush mocking Karla Faye Tucker (who was executed in Bush's state of Texas) and frequently using the word \"fuck\".[84][85] The piece led to bad publicity for Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Bush claimed that \"Mr. Carlson misread, mischaracterized me. He's a good reporter, he just misunderstood about how serious that was. I take the death penalty very seriously.\"[75][86] Among liberals, Carlson's piece received praise, with Democratic consultant Bob Shrum calling it \"vivid\". Carlson said of the interview, \"I thought I'd be ragged for writing a puffy piece. My wife said people are going to think you're hunting for a job in the Bush campaign.\"[75]\nFurther into his career in print, Carlson worked as a columnist for New York magazine and Reader's Digest; writing for Esquire, Slate, The Weekly Standard, The New Republic, The New York Times Magazine, The Daily Beast, and The Wall Street Journal.[52][75] John F. Harris of Politico would later remark on how Carlson was \"viewed\u00a0... as an important voice of the intelligentsia\" during this period.[87] While working on a story for New York covering the Taliban, Carlson, alongside his father, was involved in a plane crash as it made its landing on a runway in Dubai on October 17, 2001.[88][89][90] Carlson's 2003 Esquire profile on his journey to Liberia alongside Reverend Al Sharpton and other civil and political rights activists would garner a nomination at the National Magazine Awards.[91][92][93]\nIn his early television career Carlson wore bow ties, a habit from boarding school he continued on air until 2006.[3][94]\nOn June 21, 2021, New York Times reporter Ben Smith reported that Carlson was a media source for several journalists and authors including Michael Isikoff, Michael Wolff, Brian Stelter, and others who wrote critically of Donald Trump.[95]\n\nCNN (2000\u20132005)\nMain article: Crossfire (American TV program)\nPaul Begala (left) and Thomas McDevitt with Carlson in 2012\nIn 2000, Carlson co-hosted the short-lived show The Spin Room on CNN.[52] In 2001, he was appointed co-host of Crossfire, in which Carlson and Robert Novak represented the political right (alternating on different nights), while James Carville and Paul Begala, also alternating as hosts, represented the left.[52]\nCarlson's 2003 interview with Britney Spears, wherein he asked if she opposed the ongoing Iraq War and she responded, \"[W]e should just trust our president in every decision he makes\",[96] was featured in the 2004 film Fahrenheit 9/11, for which she won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress at the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards.[97][98]\n\nJon Stewart debate\nMain article: Jon Stewart's 2004 appearance on Crossfire\nIn October 2004, comedian and The Daily Show host Jon Stewart appeared on Crossfire, ostensibly to promote America (The Book), but he instead launched into a critique of Crossfire, saying the show was harmful to political discourse in the U.S.[52][99] Carlson was singled out by Stewart for criticism, with Carlson in turn criticizing Stewart for being biased toward the left.[52] Carlson and Begala later recalled that Stewart and one of the book's co-authors, Ben Karlin, stayed at CNN for more than an hour after the show to discuss the issues he had raised on the air, with Carlson saying, \"It was heartfelt. [Stewart] needed to do this.\"[100][101] In 2017, The New York Times referred to Stewart's \"on-air dressing-down\" of Carlson as an \"ignominious career [moment]\" for Carlson, leading to the show's cancellation.[102] The Atlantic suggested that Stewart's appearance was a turning point leading to how Carlson remade himself.[103]\nOn January 5, 2005, CNN chief Jonathan Klein told Carlson the network had decided not to renew his contract.[104] CNN announced that it was ending its relationship with Carlson and would soon cancel Crossfire.[105][106] Carlson later said: \"I resigned from Crossfire in April [2004], many months before Jon Stewart came on our show, because I didn't like the partisanship, and I thought in some ways it was kind of a pointless conversation.\"[107]\n\nPBS (2004\u20132005)\nCarlson was hired to helm a new program for PBS in November 2003, Tucker Carlson: Unfiltered, which ran concurrently with Carlson's Crossfire gig on CNN.[108] The show launched on June 18, 2004, and was, according to The New Yorker, \"part of a broader effort to push PBS further to the right ideologically\".[109][110]\nCarlson announced he was leaving the show roughly a year after it started on June 12, 2005, despite the Corporation for Public Broadcasting allocating money for another show season.[111] Carlson wanted to focus on his new MSNBC show Tucker and said that although PBS was one of the \"least bad\" instances of government spending he disagreed with, it was still \"problematic\".[111]\n\nMSNBC (2005\u20132008)\nMain article: Tucker (2005 TV program)\nCarlson's early evening show Tucker (originally titled The Situation With Tucker Carlson) premiered on June 13, 2005, on MSNBC.[112] Rachel Maddow and Jay Severin featured as guests on a rotating panel.[112] He also hosted a late-afternoon weekday wrap-up for the network during the 2006 Winter Olympics.[113][114] He reported the aftermath of the Virginia Tech shooting and Johnson Space Center shooting in 2007.[115][116][117]\nTucker was canceled by the network on March 10, 2008, owing to low ratings;[118] the final episode aired on March 14, 2008. He remained with the network as a senior campaign correspondent for the 2008 election.[119] Brian Stelter, writing for The New York Times, wrote that \"during Mr. Carlson's tenure, MSNBC's evening programming moved gradually to the left. His former time slots, 6:00\u00a0p.m. and 9:00\u00a0p.m., were subsequently occupied by two liberals, Ed Schultz and Rachel Maddow.\" Carlson said the network had changed a lot and \"they didn't have a role for me\".[120] Carlson described being fired by MSNBC as leading to a professional \"meltdown\". In discussing the termination, he described himself as \"hav[ing] a lot of problems with authority and being told what to do. I don't react well to it. I become really aggressive[.]\"[121]\n\nMedia outside journalism (2006\u20132008)\nCarlson was a contestant on season 3 of the reality show Dancing with the Stars, which aired in 2006; he was paired with professional dancer Elena Grinenko. Carlson took four-hour-a-day ballroom dance classes to prepare. In an interview a month before the show began, he lamented that he would miss classes during a two-week-long MSNBC assignment in Lebanon, saying, \"It's hard for me to remember the moves.\"[122] Carlson said he accepted ABC's invitation to perform because \"I don't do things that I'm not good at very often. I'm psyched to get to do that.\"[122] Carlson was the first contestant eliminated, on September 13, 2006.[52]\nCarlson had cameo appearances as himself in the Season\u00a01 episode \"Hard Ball\" of 30\u00a0Rock and in a Season\u00a09 episode of The King of Queens.[123][124] He had a cameo appearance in the 2008 film Swing Vote, again playing himself.[125]\n\nThe Daily Caller (2010\u20132020)\nMain article: The Daily Caller\nOn January 11, 2010, Carlson and Neil Patel (a former aide to Dick Cheney, and former college roommate of Carlson)[7] launched a political news website titled The Daily Caller. Carlson served as editor-in-chief, and occasionally wrote opinion pieces with Patel.[126] The website was funded by the conservative activist Foster Friess.[52] By February 2010, The Daily Caller was part of the White House rotating press pool.[127] Carlson reportedly offered his employees free junk food, an unmonitored keg, provided them with a ping pong table, and allowed them to sleep under their desks.[3]\nIn interviews, Carlson said The Daily Caller would not be tied to ideology but rather \"breaking stories of importance\",[128] and \"We're not enforcing any kind of ideological orthodoxy on anyone.\"[129] Columnist Mickey Kaus quit after Carlson refused to run a column critical of Fox News's coverage of the immigration policy debate due to his contractual obligations to Fox News.[130][52]\nIn June 2010, The Daily Caller published excerpts from e-mails sent between members of JournoList, an invitation-only liberal forum, consisting of \"several hundred journalists, academics and policy experts\" launched in 2007 by Ezra Klein.[131] The forum barred media reporters and conservatives.[132] Carlson had earlier attempted to join the forum on May 25, 2010, but was denied by Klein.[132] Klein offered to form a bipartisan forum with Carlson, but Carlson declined.[133] Daily Caller employees later impersonated an editor of the Arkansas Times to gain entry into JournoList.[132] The e-mails leaked by The Daily Caller, which detailed efforts to, according to Carlson, \"formulate the most effective talking points in order to defeat Palin and McCain and help elect Barack Obama president\",[134] also contained statements by The Washington Post's Dave Weigel \"wishing for the death of Rush Limbaugh\" among other controversial remarks that The Washington Post considered \"untenable\", leading to his resignation.[133][131]\nIn February 2012, The Daily Caller published an \"investigative series\" of articles co-authored by Carlson, purporting to be an insiders' expos\u00e9 of Media Matters for America, the liberal watchdog group that monitors and scrutinizes conservative media outlets, and its founder David Brock. Reuters media critic and libertarian Jack Shafer, while commenting \"I've never thought much of Media Matters' style of watchdogging or Brock's journalism\", nevertheless sharply criticized The Daily Caller piece for relying on conjecture, absence of evidence, and inclusion of \"anonymously sourced crap\", adding that \"Daily Caller is attacking Media Matters with bad journalism and lame propaganda.\"[135]\nIn June 2017, the Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal watchdog organization, said The Daily Caller was paid $150,000 by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign for its list of subscribers, whom the Trump campaign then emailed at least 25 times. The watchdog said Carlson had a conflict of interest and had violated journalistic standards.[136][137]\nIn June 2020, Carlson sold his one-third stake in The Daily Caller to Patel for an undisclosed amount and said \"Neil [Patel] runs it. I wasn't adding anything. So we made it official\".[138]\n\nFox News Channel (2009\u20132023)\nSee also: Fox & Friends\nCarlson works as a correspondent at a Hillary Clinton campaign rally at Manchester Community College, 2016\nIn May 2009, Fox News announced that Carlson was being hired as a Fox News contributor. He was a frequent guest panelist on Fox's late-night satire show Red Eye w/Greg Gutfeld, made frequent appearances on the All-Star Panel segment of Special Report with Bret Baier, was a substitute host of Hannity in Sean Hannity's absence, and produced and hosted a special entitled Fighting for Our Children's Minds in September 2010.[139][140][141]\nOn the eve of then-President Barack Obama's first debate with Mitt Romney in October 2012, Carlson publicized a 2007 video recording of then-Senator Obama criticizing the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina and complimenting his pastor at the time, Reverend Jeremiah Wright.[142][143][144] Wright's sermons had been a controversy in Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.[144] Portions of the video had been available online since 2007.[144] An anonymous user going by the name \"Sore Throwt\" (a pun on famous Watergate informant Deep Throat) had been looking for a buyer of the tape for a week before Carlson distributed it.[142][145]\nIn April 2013, Carlson replaced Dave Briggs as a co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend, joining Alisyn Camerota and Clayton Morris on Saturday and Sunday mornings.[146]\n\nTucker Carlson Tonight (2016\u20132023)\nMain article: Tucker Carlson Tonight\nOn November 14, 2016, Carlson began hosting Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News. The premiere episode of the show, which replaced On the Record,[147] was the network's most watched telecast of the year in the time slot, with 3.7\u00a0million viewers.[148]\nTucker Carlson Tonight aired at 7:00\u00a0p.m. each weeknight until January 9, 2017, when Carlson's show replaced Megyn Kelly at the 9:00\u00a0p.m. time slot after she left Fox News. In January 2017, Forbes reported that the show had \"scored consistently high ratings, averaging 2.8 million viewers per night and ranking as the number two cable news program behind The O'Reilly Factor in December\".[149] In March 2017, Tucker Carlson Tonight was the most watched cable program in the 9:00\u00a0p.m. time slot.[150]\nOn April 19, 2017, Fox News announced that Tucker Carlson Tonight would air at 8:00\u00a0p.m. following the cancellation of The O'Reilly Factor.[151] Tucker Carlson Tonight was the third-highest-rated cable news show as of March 2018.[152]\nIn October 2018, Tucker Carlson Tonight was the second highest-rated cable news show in prime time, after The Sean Hannity Show with Sean Hannity, with 3.2\u00a0million nightly viewers.[153] By the end of 2018, the show had begun to be boycotted by at least 20 advertisers after Carlson said immigration makes the country \"poorer, dirtier and more divided\". According to Fox News, the advertisers only moved their ad buys to other programs.[154]\nIn November 2018, a \"Smash Racism D.C.\" activist group associated with antifa protested outside Carlson's Washington, D.C., home.[155] Carlson's driveway was vandalized with a spray-painted anarchist symbol. Carlson alleged \"someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door,\" though police observed no damage to the door, nor did Washington Post columnist Erik Wemple when he visited the Carlson home the next day. Carlson was not home at the time of the incident.[156][157][158]\nBy January 2019, his show dropped to third with 2.8 million nightly viewers, down six percent from the previous year.[159] The show had lost at least 26 advertisers.[160][161] There were calls to fire Carlson from Fox News in March 2019 after Media Matters resurfaced remarks he had made over several years to the radio show Bubba the Love Sponge concerning women (calling them \"like dogs\" and \"extremely primitive\") and statutory rape,[24][162] Iraqis, and immigrants.[163] His ratings rose eight percent that week despite the boycotts.[27] By August 2019, Media Matters calculated that some companies had fulfilled their media buy contracts and advertising inventory for the time slot and had now begun their purchases for other time slots on Fox News.[164][165] At the close of 2019, Carlson's Nielsen ratings among all viewers 25\u201354 placed him second only to Fox's The Sean Hannity Show among cable news shows.[166]\nIn December 2019, Playboy model Karen McDougal sued Fox News after Carlson, in a 2018 episode of his show, accused her of extorting Donald Trump. In September 2020, federal judge Mary Kay Vyskocil[167] dismissed the lawsuit, citing Fox News' defense that Carlson's extortion claims were opinion based and not \"statements of fact\". The judge also agreed with Fox News' defense that reasonable viewers would have \"skepticism\" over statements Carlson makes on its show, as he often engages in \"exaggeration\" and \"non-literal commentary\", and that Carlson is not \"stating actual facts\" on its show.[167][168]\nBeginning the week of June 8\u201314, 2020, Tucker Carlson Tonight became the highest-rated cable news show in the U.S., with an average of four million viewers, beating out the shows hosted by fellow Fox News pundits Hannity and Ingraham. This came in the wake of Carlson's remarks criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement, which had caused some companies to pull their advertising from the show, including The Walt Disney Company, T-Mobile, and Papa John's.[169]\n\nCarlson at the Student Action summit in West Palm Beach, Florida, 2020\nIn July 2020, Carlson's head writer Blake Neff resigned after CNN Business reported that he had been using a pseudonym to post remarks that were widely described as racist, sexist, and homophobic on AutoAdmit, a message board known for its lack of moderation of offensive and defamatory content. The incident drew renewed scrutiny to Carlson's program, already under pressure from sponsors because of Carlson's remarks about Black Lives Matter.[170][171] Neff had also previously been a writer on The Daily Caller.[172] Carlson condemned Neff's posts on the second episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight that aired after the posts were initially reported.[173]\nBy October 2020, Tucker Carlson Tonight averaged 5.3 million viewers, with the show's monthly average becoming the highest of any cable news program in history at that point. In the 25\u201354 demographic, the show maintained an average viewership of just over a million, with 670,000 being between 18 and 49.[174][175] Carlson's program saw a dip in viewership following the aftermath of the 2020 election, losing out to Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 in the 25\u201354 demographic, which Carlson had maintained a hold of the prior month.[176] In 2020, Tucker Carlson Tonight and The Sean Hannity Show became the first cable news programs to finish a full year with viewership in excess of four million.[177]\nIn the week following the inauguration of Joe Biden as president, Tucker Carlson Tonight remained the only cable news program not to see a drop in viewership, slightly increasing from where it stood one week prior and reclaiming its lead among the 25\u201354 demographic.[178][179] It remained the most-watched news-related cable show as of mid-2021.[180][181][182] Through May 2022 it was a close second to The Five, while leading in the 25\u201354 demographic.[29]\n\nTucker Carlson Today\nIn February 2021, Carlson announced a multiyear deal with Fox News to host a new weekly podcast and series of monthly specials dubbed Tucker Carlson Originals on sister streaming service Fox Nation, which released on March 29.[183][184][185] In spring of 2021, he began hosting a show on Fox Nation called Tucker Carlson Today.[186]\n\nDeparture from Fox News\nOn the morning of Monday, April 24, 2023, Fox News dismissed Carlson and the executive producer of his evening show.[30][31] It does not appear that Carlson received advance notice of his dismissal, given that on Friday, April 21, in what became his final show's sign-off, he told his viewers that he would \"be back on Monday\". As of October 2023, a rotation of guest hosts fill Carlson's old slot until a permanent replacement is found.[187] On April 26, Carlson responded to his departure by tweeting a video that was watched millions of times.[188][189][190]\nFox did not provide a reason for Carlson's termination. The Los Angeles Times wrote that Chairman of Fox Corporation Rupert Murdoch was responsible for the firing, and that a pending lawsuit from former Fox producer Abby Grossberg and Carlson's coverage of the January 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection both influenced the decision.[191] The Wall Street Journal wrote that Carlson was dismissed due to private messages in which he criticized Fox's management, using vulgar and offensive language.[192] In May, The New York Times reported that in one such message Carlson expressed racist views by criticizing three Trump supporters who were beating one antifa activist: \"It's not how white men fight.\"[193][194] Less than a week before his ouster Fox retained law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to investigate Tucker over this and potentially other messages due to liability concerns.[195] The Washington Post wrote that the decision to oust Carlson was made by Murdoch's son, Lachlan, and Fox CEO Suzanne Scott.[196] Fox was reported to have a \"stockpile\" of damaging information that they would be ready to release in case of any retaliation made by Carlson; the network denied this, however.[197][198]\n\nTucker on Twitter / Tucker on X (since 2023)\nIn a video on his Twitter feed on May 9, 2023, Carlson said he would relaunch his show on Twitter.[199][200] Just before making the announcement, Carlson's attorneys sent a letter to Fox executives, alleging that Rupert Murdoch and other senior executives \"intentionally\" broke their promises to him, an alleged breach of contract that he says ought to free him from his non-compete clause.[201] Fox News reportedly sent him a cease and desist after the first episode aired.[202]\nThe first episode of the show, called Tucker on Twitter, was released on June 6, 2023 and lasted just over 10 minutes.[203] During  the episode, Carlson claimed that the US had recovered an extraterrestrial starship and its pilot;[36] that Volodymyr Zelensky is \"sweaty and rat-like\", and was persecuting Christians;[204] that the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam was done by Ukrainian forces;[205] that the Black Lives Matter \"riots\" were organized by an unknown entity;[204] and that the truth behind the September 11 attacks was still classified.[204]\nIn June 2023, he was reportedly seeking funds to start a new media company with Neil Patel.[206][207]\nOn August 23, 2023, Carlson hosted Donald Trump on Tucker on X (the re-branded name of Twitter) deliberately to conflict with the first 2024 Republican debate. On 6 September 2023 Carlson interviewed Larry Sinclair (who had a criminal record, largely for crimes of deceit) who claimed that he had \"had a night of crack cocaine-fueled sex with Barack Obama\" 24 years before. The interview was criticised by many, including Elon Musk, owner of X.[208][209]\nHe launched the streaming service Tucker Carlson Network in December, with both ad-supported and subscription-based content. Initially planned for Twitter/X, Musk's company was unable to deliver the needed technology. Justin Wells, a former executive producer at Fox for Carlson, will oversee programming.[210][211]\n\nWriting\nCarlson authored the memoir Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News, published by Warner Books in September 2003, about his television news experiences.[212] It received favorable reviews from Publishers Weekly and the Washingtonian, who both complimented the book for its humor.[212][213]\nIn May 2017, Carlson, represented by the literary and creative agency Javelin, signed an eight-figure, two-book deal with Simon & Schuster's conservative imprint, Threshold Editions.[214] His first book in the series, Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution, was released in October 2018,[215] and debuted at No.\u00a01 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[216] His second book, The Long Slide: Thirty Years in American Journalism, was released in August 2021.[217]\nIn 2023, a biography of Carlson titled Tucker was released. The book was written by Chadwick Moore with the help of Carlson, who had given the author more than 100 hours of interviews.[218] Moore had stated that the book was intended to tell the story of Carlson's exit from Fox News from the former host's perspective. The book performed poorly, with just over 3,000 copies sold during the first week after its release.[219][220]\n\nPolitical views\nCarlson has been described in the media as a conservative,[106][221] paleoconservative[222][223][b] and right-wing extremist.[225][226][227][228][229] In 2021, Time magazine said Carlson \"may be the most powerful conservative in America\".[15] Writing for New York magazine's Intelligencer in 2019, Park MacDougald called Carlson a \"Middle American radical\", which he described as someone who holds populist economic beliefs; hostility to corporatocracy; fervent positions on nationalism, race, and immigration; and a preference for a strong U.S. president. MacDougald identified this form of radicalism as the ideological core of Trumpism.[230] Carlson is noted for circulating white nationalist views and terminology into mainstream political discourse, in particular, repackaging the fringe racist \"replacement\" conspiracy theory into a version that accuses Democrats and \"elites\" of forcing demographic change.[231][232][12][11] More virulent versions of the conspiracy theory have been cited by gunmen in several mass shootings targeting minorities; Carlson has denounced the attacks.[231]\nCarlson is a Republican.[233][234][235] He was previously registered as a Democrat in Washington, D.C., from 2006 to 2020.[233][236] In 2017, Carlson said his registration as a Democrat was to gain the right to vote in the primaries for mayoral elections in the district, and that he nevertheless \"sincerely despise[s]\" the Democratic Party and \"always vote[d] for the more corrupt candidate over the idealist\" in order to favor the status quo and stem progressivism.[237] Carlson campaigned for Republicans and Republican-affiliated causes during his time as a Democrat.[238][239]\n\nParties and candidates\nCarlson with Charlie Kirk in 2018\nIn public correspondence in Slate with Texas Monthly's Evan Smith on November 29, 1999, Carlson agreed with Smith's low opinion of Donald Trump,[240] who was then running for president with the Reform Party. Carlson wrote that Trump was \"the single most repulsive person on the planet\" and that the Reform Party consisted of \"a bunch of wackos\".[241][8] Separately, he criticized the party's eventual nominee, Pat Buchanan.[242] In his 2018 book, Ship of Fools, Carlson wrote that he had adopted some of Buchanan's views.[8][243]\nCarlson voted for George W. Bush in the 2000 election.[244] Carlson told Salon in 2003 that some Washington conservatives suspected he was \"secretly liberal\" because he liked John McCain.[245] Carlson said in an interview, \"by my criteria, Bush isn't much of a conservative\".[40] Carlson did not vote in the 2004 election, citing his souring on the Iraq War, his disillusionment with the once small-government Republican Party, and his disappointment with Bush and like-minded conservatives.[40][41]\nCarlson was reportedly floated as a potential candidate for the Libertarian nomination in the 2008 presidential election. He was included in polling at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, with unconfirmed speculation arising that he was personally funding the effort.[246] Carlson spoke at Ron Paul's independent Rally for the Republic convention, opposite the official 2008 Republican National Convention, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which served as a \"message of revolt to the Republican Party\" and a general celebration of Paul's policy proposals.[247]\nHe expressed his disappointment with the Republican nominee for the 2012 election, Mitt Romney, and the health care reform he signed in 2006 as governor of Massachusetts, which contained an individual mandate, saying, \"out of 315 million Americans, the Republican Party managed to find the one guy who couldn't run on Obamacare\".[248]\nWriting for Politico in January 2016, Carlson expressed his support for Donald Trump's candidacy and his positions, such as his proposed \"Muslim ban\", and criticized the other Republican candidates for not similarly making immigration a core issue.[249][239][c] During the Trump presidency,[c] Carlson was described in Politico as \"perhaps the highest-profile proponent of 'Trumpism'\u00a0\u2013 a blend of anti-immigrant nationalism, economic populism and America First isolationism\".[5] Carlson's commentaries did not uniformly praise Trump, but he had frequent scorn for Trump's critics; some commentators called Carlson an exemplar of \"anti-anti-Trump\" arguments.[3][250][251][252] In March 2023, Carlson defended Trump after he was indicted in New York, calling the indictment \"elections interference\".[253][254] Despite his praise for Trump, he has at times been critical.[255][256] Carlson criticized the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, ordered by Trump in January 2020[255] and said in June 2020 that Trump had let Black Lives Matter protests go too far.[256] In private correspondence, he referred to Trump as a \"demonic force\" and wrote, \"I hate him passionately\".[257][258][259][260][261]\nFollowing the 2020 election, Carlson reportedly told people he had voted for independent candidate Kanye West, though Politico points out that it was unclear whether Carlson \"was serious or merely joking\".[233] In July 2021, Carlson told Time magazine that the Republican Party is \"inept and bad at governing\" and \"much more effective as an oppositional force than it is as a governing party\".[15][262]\nCarlson supported J. D. Vance in the 2022 Republican U.S. Senate primary in Ohio and privately persuaded Trump to endorse him despite Vance's past anti-Trump comments.[263] Former Hawaii congresswoman and Democratic presidential primary contender Tulsi Gabbard was a substitute host on Tucker Carlson Tonight in 2022; she appeared on the show the night she left the Democratic Party in October 2022, to Carlson's praise.[264]\n\nAbortion and death penalty\nCarlson opposes abortion and has said it is the only political issue he considers non-negotiable.[3][265][266] Carlson has described Roe v. Wade as \"the most embarrassing court decision handed down in the last century\".[267]\nCarlson wrote in 2000 that capital punishment \"deserves more vigorous debate\",[268] and in 2003 told Salon, \"I'm opposed to the death penalty as I am adamantly opposed to abortion\".[245] After saying on Fox News in 2010 that Michael Vick \"should have been executed\" for dog fighting, Carlson stated that he is \"not comfortable with the death penalty under any circumstances\".[269][270]\n\nGuns\nCarlson supports the right to keep and bear arms.[271] He has opposed gun control and the assault weapons ban.[272][273][274][275] He has debated several Democrats on gun control.[276][277][278] In 2015, he said Australian gun laws were \"insane\" and \"childish\".[279][280] In March 2018, he criticized Donald Trump for comments supporting gun control after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.[281][282] In a 2019 interview, Carlson said he owns an AR-15 style rifle and said \"all my guns are working-class guns\".[283][284] He has a concealed carry permit in the District of Columbia.[284]\nCarlson aired segments defending Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old who shot three protesters, killing two, in August 2020 in confrontations during unrest after a police shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin.[285][286][287] At trial Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all charges.[288]\n\nEconomics\nCarlson at a 2007 Ron Paul event\nEarly in his career, Carlson supported libertarian economics. He supported Ron Paul's 1988 presidential candidacy, when Paul ran as the candidate for the Libertarian Party, along with his 2008 presidential candidacy, when Paul ran as a Republican.[39][289] Carlson said in 2004, \"I hate all nanny-state regulations, such as seat belt laws and smoking bans.\"[40] From 2009 through 2015, Carlson was a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.[290][291]\nSince 2018, he has promoted more populist economics,[52] attacking libertarianism, saying \"market capitalism is not a religion\" and portraying some Republicans as \"controlled by the banks\".[292][39] In an interview, he said that economic and technological change that occurs too quickly can cause widespread social and political upheaval, and praised President Theodore Roosevelt, saying his intervention in the economy in the early 1900s may have prevented a communist revolution in the United States.[293] In 2019 on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson said America's \"ruling class\" are, in effect, the \"mercenaries\" behind the decline of the American middle class, and \"any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\"[292][294] He cited parallels between the problems of inner cities and rural areas as evidence that the \"culture of poverty\" cited by conservatives as the cause of urban decline \"wasn't the whole story\", and that \"Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible.\"[295][296][297] In January 2019, Carlson used a Washington Post op-ed by Romney to criticize what he described as the \"mainstream Republican\" worldview, consisting of \"unwavering support for a finance-based economy.[295]\nCarlson has criticized hedge funds (singling out the Republican donor Paul Singer in 2019) and private equity (in criticizing Mitt Romney, former CEO of Bain Capital).[298][295] He described the business model of firms like Bain as: \"Take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. ... Meanwhile, a remarkable number of the companies are now bankrupt or extinct.\"[295][299] He attacked payday lenders, saying they \"loan people money they can't possibly repay\" and \"charge them interest that impoverishes them\"[295][292][300] He praised Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's economic plan and called her book The Two Income Trap \"one of the best books I've ever read on economics\".[301][302]\n\nEnvironment\nOn his show, Carlson frequently hosts guests who downplay the scientific consensus on climate change,[303] and disagreed with Bill Nye on the subject.[304][305][306][307] Carlson has also said that he does not consider climate change a threat.[308] Carlson believes that global warming will have many positive effects on Earth, namely \"more arable land in places like Canada and northern Europe\".[309]\nIn 2023, Carlson, Clean Ocean Action, and multiple Republicans criticized New Jersey and New York's use of wind power, falsely claiming that it has been contributing to the deaths of whales.[310][311]\n\nForeign policy\nCarlson is skeptical of foreign intervention, has expressed regret for his public support of the U.S. invading Iraq in 2003, and has said \"the U.S. ought to hesitate before intervening abroad\".[42] Carlson is known for some defenses of authoritarian foreign leaders, including Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary and Vladimir Putin of Russia;[312][313][11] Carlson's praise for Orb\u00e1n included a visit and his online film Hungary vs. Soros,[314][315] and Carlson was noted for defending Putin in the lead-up to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.[316][317]\n\nIraq\nCarlson initially supported the Iraq War. A year after the invasion of Iraq, he began criticizing the war, telling The New York Observer: \"I think it's a total nightmare and disaster, and I'm ashamed that I went against my own instincts in supporting it.\"[318] In 2004, Carlson wrote a commentary in Esquire accusing Bush of weakness after the September 11 attacks and in the invasion of Iraq.[244] Carlson said \"Iraq is a crappy place filled with a bunch of, you know, semi-literate primitive monkeys, that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t worth invading.\".[319]\n\nIran\nIn July 2017, Carlson said that \"we actually don't face any domestic threat from Iran\". He asked Max Boot to \"tell me how many Americans in the United States have been murdered by terrorists backed by Iran since 9/11?\"[320] According to The New York Times, Carlson played an influential role in dissuading Trump from launching military strikes against Iran in response to the shooting down of an American drone in June 2019. Carlson reportedly told Trump that if he listened to his hawkish advisors and went ahead with the strikes, he would not win re-election.[43] In 2019, Carlson lobbied Donald Trump to fire his national security advisor, John Bolton. Carlson said Bolton was \"demented\" for seeking a military strike against Iran and accused him of undermining Trump by disagreeing publicly with Trump's decisions.[321][47][46] Trump fired Bolton on September 10, 2019.[46] Carlson called the 2020 assassination of Qasem Soleimani a \"quagmire\". He criticized the \"chest-beaters\" who promote foreign interventions, particularly Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE), and asked, \"By the way, if we're still in Afghanistan, 19 years, sad years, later, what makes us think there's a quick way out of Iran?\"[255]\n\nSyria\nCarlson opposes overthrowing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and has downplayed some of the Assad regime's human rights violations in the Syrian Civil War.[320][322] In April 2018, Carlson questioned whether Assad was responsible for the Douma chemical attack that had occurred a few days earlier and killed dozens.[323][324] In November 2019, Carlson repeated this claim and queried whether the attack had happened at all.[325] Carlson suggested that a similar attack that occurred the year before (the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack), which was attributed to Assad's forces and which the OPCW JIM indicated was carried out with sarin that bore the regime's signature, was a false flag attack perpetrated to falsely implicate the Assad government. Carlson compared Assad's war crimes during the Syrian Civil War to Saudi Arabia's war crimes in Yemen.[323]\n\nIsrael\nIn 2006, Carlson appeared live from Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon[326][327] Early on in the conflict Carlson proposed that Lebanon fight and push out Hezbollah instead of going to war with Israel.[328] During the conflict he criticized Syria involvement in the conflict in the form of supporting Hezbollah and later expressing some support for the Israel Defense Forces.[329][330] However he also criticized the Israel Defense Forces tactics it used in fighting Hezbollah.[329]\nDuring the 2023 Israel-Hamas War, Carlson criticized both President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson support for military aid to Israel and called for American neutrality during the conflict.[331][332] He declared Israel guilty of war crimes.[333] Commentators have described him as part of a growing faction within the Republican Party that is indifferent to or directly opposed to Zionism.[334]\n\nHungary\nIn August 2021, Carlson traveled to Hungary, broadcasting from Budapest. He praised the country and its prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, for rejecting asylum seekers on its border, and ridiculed the idea that Orb\u00e1n was authoritarian.[53][314][335][336] He spoke at a conference sponsored by the Mathias Corvinus Collegium.[337] In January 2022, Carlson released the film Hungary vs. Soros on Fox Nation. According to Vox, it promoted conspiracy theories about Soros and suggested that criticism of the Hungarian government was a function of jealousy from the political left.[338] The Open Society Foundations, a group founded by Soros, called the film \"anti-American propaganda\", and its Vice President Laura Silber stated that \"Carlson appears to prefer authoritarian rule, state capture of media and the courts, crony corruption and rigged elections.\"[315][339]\n\nMexico\nCarlson supported Trump's expansion of the Mexico\u2013United States barrier, saying a wall was needed to \"restore sovereignty\" to the border.[340]\nIn a July 2018 interview about Russian involvement in U.S. elections, Carlson claimed that Mexico had interfered in U.S. elections \"more successfully\" than Russia by \"packing our electorate\" through mass immigration.[341] This assertion was disputed by journalist Philip Bump, who wrote that the number of Mexicans in the U.S. had decreased since 2009 and asked rhetorically: \"What good has it done Mexico to have a number of its citizens move to the United States and gain the right to vote?\"[342]\nIn May 2019, Carlson defended Trump's decision to place tariffs on Mexico unless Mexico stopped illegal immigration to the United States. Carlson said, \"When the United States is attacked by a hostile foreign power it must strike back, and make no mistake Mexico is a hostile foreign power.\"[343]\n\nEl Salvador\nCarlson has visited El Salvador on three occasions, twice under Bukele's rule, and routinely defended his strongman policies to reduce crime and combat the MS-13 gangs.[344][345][346]\n\nRussia\nCarlson has stated he does not consider Russia a serious threat to the United States,[320] and he has called for the United States to work with Russia in the Syrian Civil War against a common enemy like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS).[347][348] Carlson has compared Russian President Vladimir Putin favorably to American liberals on multiple occasions: he has asserted that Putin does not hate the United States as much as American liberals do,[349] and he has suggested that there is no reason to hate Putin, asking his viewers to consider whether Putin has ever called them racist or threatened to get them fired for disagreeing with him. Carlson has said that it is \"not treason, it is not un-American\" to support Putin: \"It's the whole point of America\".[317]\nCarlson condemned Putin for the Russian invasion of Ukraine,[350] but he has promoted pro-Russian disinformation both before and after the invasion, describing the build up as a \"border dispute\"[350] and later supporting the Russian conspiracy theory that the U.S. and Ukraine were purportedly developing biological weapons in Ukraine.[351][352][353] Many of Carlson's broadcasts have been used by Russian state television to support their messaging,[354][355] and Mother Jones reported[356] that the Kremlin sent a memo to state-friendly media outlets saying it was \"essential\" to use video clips of Carlson \"as much as possible\". Mother Jones further observed Carlson was the only Western media pundit that the Kremlin adopted in this way.[357][358]\nPeter Beinart of The Atlantic said Carlson has been an \"apologist for Donald Trump on the Russia scandal\".[320] Carlson described the controversy over revelations that Donald Trump Jr. was willing to accept opposition research about Hillary Clinton from a Russian government official as a \"new level of hysteria\" and said that Trump Jr. had only been \"gossiping with foreigners\".[320]\n\nNorth Korea\nWhen President Trump met the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the country's border with the South in June 2019, Carlson, who was touring with Trump, defended Trump's friendship with Kim. Carlson told Fox & Friends that the North Korean regime was \"monstrous\" and North Korea was a \"disgusting place\" but \"On the other hand, you've got to be honest about what it means to lead a country. It means killing people\".[359] Carlson went on to argue that \"a lot of countries commit atrocities including a number that we're closely allied with\".[360][361][362][363]\n\nChina\nCarlson has said normalization of relations with China following President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit led to unforeseen consequences, and that America became progressively worse off for it.[364][third-party source needed] He criticized LeBron James for speaking out against Daryl Morey, the latter having tweeted in support of the 2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests,[365][366] and referred to the former CEO of The Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger, as a \"propagandist\" for the Chinese Communist Party.[364][third-party source needed]\nOn November 20, 2020, The New York Times reported that Steve Bannon and Chinese businessman Guo Wengui had brought Li-Meng Yan to America to promote the COVID-19 lab leak theory, a theory that states COVID-19 was made in a Chinese laboratory and then escaped for the lab. Bannon and Guo set up appearances for Yan on Carlson's show to promote the theory. Carlson would later say that he did not endorse her theories. Nonetheless, Carlson still hosted her on his show for a second appearance.[367]\n\nColonialism\nOn March 2021, Carlson stated that issues like the Latin American immigration crisis should be blamed on \"other colonial powers centuries ago\" instead of the United States, and suggested that the Spanish government, having a \"legacy responsibility for what is happening in Latin America\", should start by \"sending back the gold now sitting in its central bank.\"[368] Tucker statements on Spain were criticized by Hermann Tertsch and Mamela Fiallo for supporting the Spanish Black Legend,[369][370] though Fiallo's rebuttal article in La Gaceta was retracted on November 2023 after Tucker's prescence with Santiago Abascal in support for the 2023 Spanish protests.[370]\nAfter the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022, Carlson opined that the British Empire, although \"not perfect\", had brought civilization to regions it occupied with \"decency unmatched by any empire in human history\". He was criticized in India by figures including the politician and historian Shashi Tharoor, who had written a book detailing atrocities by the British Raj.[371][372][373]\n\nImmigration and race\nCarlson at the Immigrants' Rights rally in Washington Mall, 2006\nCarlson is a frequent critic of immigration,[38] and has been described by multiple writers as demonizing both documented and undocumented immigrants.[374][375][376] White grievance politics is a persistent theme in Carlson's commentary.[8] Sources such as CNN and The Washington Post have said Carlson promotes racism,[9][376][26][377][378] a charge he denies, saying in 2018, \"I'm not a racist. I hate racism.\"[52] Carlson has repeatedly promoted a conspiracy theory that Democrats are seeking \"demographic replacement\" to increase their voter base, and in 2021 he described this as \"the Great Replacement\", using white nationalist terminology.[379][14][380][378][381] Carlson has described white supremacy as \"not a real problem in America\".[382] Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center has said that \"Carlson probably has been the No.\u00a01 commentator mainstreaming bedrock principles of white nationalism in [the U.S.].\"[13] Terry Smith, a law professor at St. Thomas University, has called Carlson's rhetoric an example of white identity politics.[383] University of Michigan professor Alexandra Stern has written that Carlson propagates demographic fear.[384] Neoconservative pundit Bill Kristol described Carlson's commentaries in 2018 as \"close now to racism\" and \"ethno-nationalism of some kind, let's call it\".[385]\n\nRacism and white supremacy\nCarlson has compared the Obama administration's stance on anti-police protests to Nazism for \"[categorizing] people by race\",[386][387] and he has alleged that the George Floyd protests were about \"ideological domination\" rather than police brutality. The latter comment prompted several advertisers to boycott his program.[388][389][390][391] Carlson has falsely claimed that Floyd was not killed by officer Derek Chauvin[392] and that Chauvin was only found guilty because the jurors felt threatened by rioters.[393]\nWhen Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee for president, denounced Trump in March 2016, saying Trump made a \"disqualifying and disgusting response\" by evading questions about former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke's support,[394] Carlson criticized Romney and dismissed his speech by suggesting \"Obama could have written this.\"[395][396]\n\nCriticisms of racism\nAfter Neff, his head writer, was fired for hateful blog posts in 2020, Carlson said of the posts, \"They have no connection to the show. It is wrong to attack people for qualities they cannot control.\"[397] Separately, Carlson said in 2017 that he does not approve of white supremacy.[250] In 2018, he criticized China's treatment of Muslims.[398][399]\nIn 2022, in response to The New York Times publishing a report criticizing Carlson and his show, Carlson said that his show did not have a controversial opinion on race, saying \"Our view of race is really simple. We believe Martin Luther King Jr. We don't think your skin color is the most important thing about you. We think all people were created by God and should therefore be judged by what they do, not by how they look.\"[400] Carlson has also offered praise for Malcolm X, saying that unlike other civil rights leaders, Malcolm X \"didn't talk like a sharecropper. He spoke dignified standard English. He wasn't running a shakedown racket to fleece guilty white liberals.\"[401]\n\nViews on Islam\nCarlson is critical of Islam and has hosted guests on his program that criticize Islam.[402][403] He has described the existence of an \"Islamic cult\" and an \"Islamic problem\", describing it as a threat to the United States.[402] He was critical of the Obama administration's terrorism policy, arguing that it should have considered Islam as a cause of terrorism.[402] In 2019, advocacy group Media Matters for America released recordings of racist comments that Carlson made in 2006 including that Iraq was not worth invading because he believed it to be a country made up of \"semi-literate primitive monkeys\" and \"lunatic Muslims who are behaving like animals\".[25]\n\nImmigrants and the Great Replacement conspiracy theory\nIn 2018, Carlson described the effects of mass immigration on the United States using the terms dirtier, poorer, and more divided[404][405] and said it \"has badly hurt this country's natural landscape\".[406] On another 2018 episode, Carlson criticized multiculturalism in the United States, skeptically asking \"how, precisely, is diversity our strength?\" and whether any other institutions benefitted from a lack of commonalities.[407][408] Talking about Hazleton, Pennsylvania, where Hispanics had quickly become a majority of the population, Carlson said it was \"more change than human beings are designed to digest\".[376] In May 2019 he said, \"The flood of illegal workers into the United States has damaged our communities, ruined our schools, burdened our healthcare system and fractured our national unity.\"[343] In December 2019, he falsely claimed that immigrants were responsible for making the Potomac River \"dirtier and dirtier\".[409][410]\nCarlson has accused Democrats of supporting increased immigration to change the racial demographics of the United States to increase the Democratic voter base. Commentators and organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) have described these views as endorsement of the Great Replacement conspiracy theory.[14][62][411][412] Carlson has also accused President Joe Biden of engaging in eugenics and \"Great Replacement\" through a policy of increased immigration.[380][413] Despite this, Carlson has challenged accusations that he believes the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, describing it as a \"voting rights question\".[14] He has also questioned the popularity of the conspiracy theory after it was invoked by multiple white supremacist mass shooters, including the 2019 El Paso shooting and the 2022 Buffalo shooting, contradicting his previous endorsement of the conspiracy theory and calling its existence a \"hoax\".[379][414][382][415][231]\n\nSouth Africa\nIn August 2018, Carlson alleged that the South African government was targeting white farmers because \"they are the wrong skin color\" and falsely said the country's president had changed the constitution to allow land thefts from whites during ongoing land reform efforts.[416][417][418][419][420] CBS News, Associated Press, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal described Carlson's segment (with guest Marian Tupy of the Cato Institute) as false or misleading, because violence against farmers had reached an all-time low and the reforms had yet to pass and were primarily aimed at land that had fallen into disuse.[421][417][418][422][420][423][424]\nFollowing the Carlson segment, President Trump tweeted that he had instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to \"closely study the South Africa land and farm seizure and large scale killing of farmers\".[416][417][418] The South African government responded that Trump's tweet was \"misinformed\" and said it would address the matter through diplomatic channels. AfriForum, a South African non-governmental organization focused mainly on the interests of Afrikaners, took credit for Carlson's and Trump's statements, saying it believed that its campaign to influence American politics had succeeded.[418]\nThe evening after the segment, Carlson acknowledged that the proposed amendment was still being debated and added that no farms had yet been expropriated, though he did not admit to having made errors. Carlson later said in an interview that his South Africa segment made \"an argument against tribalism\".[420]\n\nIlhan Omar\nCarlson concluded Tucker Carlson Tonight on July 9, 2019, with a three-minute monologue about Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who was born in Somalia and immigrated to the United States as a refugee as an adolescent. Carlson accused Omar of being ungrateful to the United States, and called her \"living proof that the way we practice immigration has become dangerous to this country\". His monologue was described by The Guardian as \"racially loaded\" and \"full of anti-immigrant rhetoric\".[425] Omar responded on Twitter, saying that \"advertisers should not be underwriting this kind of dangerous, hateful rhetoric\".[426] The Daily Beast commented that Carlson had devoted numerous segments to criticizing Omar, and that largely due to \"right-wing attacks that have then been amplified by members of Congress and the president\", Omar had been receiving death threats since her election to Congress.[427]\n\nKanye West interview\nOn the October 6 and 7, 2022 episodes of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson aired an edited version of an interview with rapper and fashion designer Ye, also known by his birth name Kanye West. West and conservative commentator Candace Owens had recently been photographed at Paris Fashion Week wearing matching shirts that read \"White Lives Matter\", a phrase often associated with white supremacist groups. In his interview with Carlson, West said he had worn the shirt because he found it \"funny\" and agreed with the message. When Carlson asked West about a badge West was wearing on a lanyard around his neck, West stated that it was an image from an obstetric ultrasound, and added, \"It just represents life. I'm pro-life\"; he claimed without evidence \"that there are more Black babies being aborted than born in New York City at this point.\"[428]\nOn October 11, 2022, the Vice website Motherboard published leaked unaired footage from the interview. In the unaired footage, West expressed Black Hebrew Israelite views, stated he had received a COVID-19 vaccine, and claimed that paid child actors had been \"placed into [his] house to sexualize [his] kids\"; in one instance, referring to a Kwanzaa celebration at his children's school, West said, \"I prefer my kids knew Hanukkah than Kwanzaa [sic]. At least it will come with some financial engineering.\"[429][430][431][432] The leaked footage was heavily scrutinized in light of other antisemitic statements West had made on social media in the days after the Tucker Carlson Tonight interview aired, including an October 8 tweet in which he threatened to go \"death con 3 [sic]\" on Jewish people.[429][430] Philip Bump of The Washington Post wrote that Carlson had presented \"a very specific version\" of West's remarks that \"mirrored Carlson's rhetoric on race and politics\".[432] Ben Samuels of Haaretz wrote that the episode \"brings Carlson's history of providing a platform for antisemitism further into focus\".[430]\n\nGender and sexuality\nCarlson is an opponent of feminism.[8][186] In a December 2021 segment despairing the falling labor participation rate of U.S. men, Carlson said, \"Men and women are very different, extremely different. Society is built on their differences.\"[433] He has alleged that feminists want girls to make gains at the expense of boys.[186] He was rebuked by the U.S. military in March 2021 after he ridiculed maternity flight suits for U.S. women soldiers and described a decision by the Chinese military to build ships as \"more masculine\".[434] He used the words pig and cunt to describe several individual women in remarks from 2006 to 2011 on the radio show Bubba the Love Sponge.[24] In 2022, Carlson released The End of Men, a Tucker Carlson Original alleging a decline in American masculinity. The episode featured Raw Egg Nationalist,[435] a pseudonymous author affiliated with Neo-Nazi publishing house Antelope Hill.[436][437][438][439] Carlson is critical of the use of SSRIs because of their impact on sexual drive.[121]\nCarlson has highlighted what he considers excesses of LGBT people on the political left.[440] Some of his comments on air have been described as homophobic, including a 2006 radio conversation in which he and Bubba the Love Sponge used the word faggot to describe their affection for each other, and his 2007 description of an incident during high school of beating up a gay man who had made an advance on him in a public bathroom.[25][81] In the same year, he called Democratic primary contenders cowards for not pledging to legalize same sex marriage and stated that he would support that.[441] In 2021, Carlson belittled the paternity leave taken by U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, a gay man, joking that Buttigieg could be \"trying to figure out how to breastfeed\".[442] Carlson's promotion of inflammatory rhetoric about LGBTQ controversies[443] was scrutinized after the Colorado Springs nightclub mass shooting in November 2022.[444] Carlson has strongly criticized the transgender rights movement,[445] including saying hospitals that provide gender-affirming healthcare to minors are criminals who harm children, and that they should not be surprised to receive threatening phone calls.[446]\nIn September 2023 Tucker Carlson interviewed a man who claimed to have had gay sex with Barack Obama.[447]\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and vaccines\nCarlson differed with Trump and some of his colleagues at Fox News in early 2020 by saying COVID-19 should be taken more seriously in the U.S,[448][449] and he reportedly influenced then-President Trump to take the virus more seriously.[448][450][451] Carlson blamed China for causing the pandemic.[449] By May 2020, Carlson began to publicly question the severity of the virus.[452] Carlson criticized stay-at-home orders brought on by the pandemic[453] and defended protests against lockdowns in rural areas.[454] In February 2022, he supported the Canada convoy protest against COVID-19 restrictions and called it \"the single most successful human rights protest in a generation\".[455] He also claimed that some U.S. officials were overstating the deadliness of the virus\u00a0\u2013 a claim that PolitiFact called mostly false.[452] Carlson mentioned the anti-parasite medication ivermectin as a possible COVID-19 treatment, though the FDA warned against its use.[456][457]\nCarlson has repeatedly misrepresented the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and asserted that U.S. officials were \"lying\" about them.[458][459][460][461][462][463] He has falsely suggested that COVID-19 vaccines suppress the immune system,[464] and he has misrepresented federal data to claim that 30 Americans died after receiving the vaccine each day,[465][466][467] misleading his audience by citing the unverified VAERS database that included deaths from unrelated causes.[468][465][469][460][470] He has likened vaccine passports to segregationist Jim Crow laws,[471][472] and he claimed that a vaccine mandate in the U.S. Armed Forces was designed to oust \"the sincere Christians in the ranks, the free thinkers, the men with high testosterone levels, and anyone else who doesn't love Joe Biden\".[473] He has also falsely claimed that the government was attempting to \"force people to take medicine they don't want or need\" through door-to-door vaccines.[474][475] Carlson says he has not been vaccinated against COVID-19.[476]\nCarlson routinely criticized National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci during Fauci's tenure.[453][477] This criticism included repeated false allegations that Fauci was responsible for the creation of COVID-19, with Carlson also falsely claiming that Fauci lied about the origin of COVID-19 to sell vaccines.[16][23][477] According to Jon Cohen in Science, \"Carlson took facts out of context and cited long-debunked studies or reports to attack Fauci\".[23] Fauci responded to Carlson's remarks by calling them a \"crazy conspiracy theory\".[478]\nCarlson was a vocal critic of the use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, calling people wearing masks outdoors \"zealots and neurotics\".[479][480] He received significant public backlash for his claim that having children wear face masks was tantamount to child abuse and that it warranted a response \"no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid in Walmart\".[479][480][481] Carlson has pointed to the use of masks as evidence that vaccines do not work, falsely claiming that there would be no benefits to mask use with an effective vaccine.[482][478]\n\n2020 election aftermath\nAhead of the 2020 election, in September, Carlson told viewers that Democrats were promoting mail-in voting to create \"uncertainty over the outcome of the election, so they can manipulate the results\".[483] After Joe Biden won the election in November, Carlson raised false allegations of fraud in the election.[484][485][486][487] On his show, he mentioned the names of purportedly dead individuals who voted in Georgia; investigative reporting subsequently found that some of the individuals whom he claimed to be dead were in fact alive. Carlson apologized on his show for the error.[488] Carlson distanced himself from Trump's post-election legal fights, in which Carlson said the election was \"not fair\" but acknowledged that it still would not produce a Trump victory.[489][490]\nLater that month, Carlson cast doubt on unfounded conspiratorial claims made by former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell, who alleged that Venezuela, Cuba and unidentified communist interests had used a secret algorithm to hack into voting machines and commit widespread electoral fraud.[491] Carlson said \"what Powell was describing would amount to the single greatest crime in American history\", but that Powell became \"angry and told us to stop contacting her\" when he asked for evidence of widespread voter fraud.[491] Prominent defenders of Trump criticized Carlson for his skepticism, though Powell was dropped from Trump's legal team shortly afterward.[492][493] Carlson later brought on Mike Lindell on January 26, 2021, whose company My Pillow was the largest advertiser on Tucker Carlson Tonight, to criticize Dominion Voting Systems and claim it had \"hired hit groups and bots and trolls\" to target him following his Twitter account's permanent suspension for promoting unfounded fraud claims.[494][495]\nIn July 2021, Carlson suggested that \"there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, last November\" despite the state's election results being validated via both hand and machine recounts. PolitiFact found that none of the evidence provided by Carlson substantiated his conclusion. For example, because Trump and Biden ballots were sorted into separate piles during the hand recount, tally sheets with votes exclusively for either candidate are not indicative of fraud.[496]\nIn August 2022, Carlson was deposed as part of a lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News over false claims of voter fraud made about the company.[497][498][499] The following February, Dominion's legal team released texts and other products of discovery against Fox, revealing that Carlson privately doubted the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and mocked Trump advisors, including Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. Carlson texted to Laura Ingraham, \"Sidney Powell is lying by the way. I caught her. It's insane\" and \"Our viewers are good people and they believe it.\"[500] Carlson also texted Sean Hannity, saying Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich should be fired for tweeting a fact-check of false claims Carlson and Trump circulated about Dominion. He wrote \"Please get her fired. Seriously ... What the fuck? I'm actually shocked ... It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It's measurably hurting the company. The stock price is down. Not a joke.\", and said he \"just went crazy on\" a Fox executive over Heinrich's reporting. Heinrich's tweet was deleted by the next morning.[258][501]\nAlso published were texts of Carlson regarding Donald Trump, with Carlson stating: \"I hate him passionately\". About Trump's presidency, he texted: \"We're all pretending we've got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster it's been is too tough to digest. But come on. There really isn't an upside to Trump.\"[502] In March 2023, Carlson said in an interview that he was \"enraged that my private texts were pulled\" for the court case, and asserted: \"I love Trump \u2026 I think Trump is funny and insightful.\"[503]\n\n2021 U.S. Capitol attack\nIn February 2021, after attorney general nominee Merrick Garland pledged at his confirmation hearing to supervise the prosecution of \"white supremacists and others\" involved in the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Carlson alleged, \"There's no evidence that white supremacists were responsible for what happened on January 6. That's a lie.\"[504] PolitiFact rated Carlson's claim false, because several rioters had known ties to white supremacist groups, according to court records and congressional testimony by law enforcement leaders, and video and photos from the incident showed white supremacist symbols prominently displayed.[505][506] Philip Bump of The Washington Post wrote in an analysis that Carlson was blurring the lines between \"being involved\" and \"being responsible for\" to create a strawman in an effort to \"undercut the public understanding of what happened and, by extension, to soften the implications for Trump and his supporters\".[507] Carlson has also inaccurately stated that \"[n]ot a single person in the crowd on January 6 was found to be carrying a firearm.\"[508]\nIn June 2021, Carlson promoted a conspiracy theory alleging that the Capitol storming was a \"false flag\" FBI operation intended to \"suppress political dissent\".[18][509][510] He alleged that unindicted co-conspirators in rioters' indictments were government agents, saying, \"FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6, according to government documents\".[511][18] Legal experts said Carlson's claim was unfounded because prosecutors cannot describe an undercover agent as an unindicted co-conspirator.[18][512][513] One of the unindicted co-conspirators was readily identifiable as Stewart Rhodes, founder and leader of Oath Keepers, a far-right anti-government militia; another unindicted co-conspirator was likely the wife of an indicted alleged conspirator.[18][512][514] Carlson's guest, Darren Beattie of Revolver News,[d] whose writing the segment was primarily based on, had been fired as a Trump speechwriter in 2018 after CNN asked the White House about his attendance at a gathering of white nationalists.[18][512] Carlson also said Russian president Vladimir Putin raised \"fair questions\" when Putin mentioned the fatal police shooting of a rioter inside the Capitol while denying involvement in the poisoning of a Russian politician.[515][516] Republican House members Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene quickly embraced Carlson's story about FBI involvement in the Capitol attack, and Republican congressman Paul Gosar entered the Revolver News story into the Congressional Record during a House Oversight Committee hearing.[509]\nIn response to Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley's defense of studying critical race theory \"to understand white rage\" as it concerns the storming, Carlson said, \"Hard to believe that man wears a uniform. ... He's not just a pig, he's stupid!\"[517]\nAfter Carlson criticized Senator Ted Cruz for calling the Capitol storming a \"terrorist attack\", Cruz appeared on Carlson's show on January 6, 2022, the anniversary of the event, and apologized for his words.[518]\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy in early 2023 gave Carlson exclusive access to 44,000 hours of security surveillance video from the day of the Capitol attack. Carlson subsequently aired portions of it on his show to illustrate his own narrative concerning the event, painting it as \"peaceful chaos\" and condemning other media outlets as untruthful when portraying the attack as violent.[519][520] The family of Brian Sicknick, a United States Capitol Police officer who died the day following the Capitol attack, and Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger condemned the segment,[521][522] which also received reproach from Democratic and Republican politicians, including from the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell.[523] Carlson's presentation included video of Jacob Chansley \u2014 the \"QAnon Shaman\" \u2014 walking the halls of Congress, depicting him as a peaceful demonstrator being escorted by police who was unjustly prosecuted and incarcerated. Days after the presentation, Justice Department prosecutors stated in a court filing that the four minutes of video showed only a brief part of Chansley's activity and omitted his earlier incriminating behavior, concluding, \"Chansley was not some passive, chaperoned observer of events for the roughly hour that he was unlawfully inside the Capitol.\"[524]\nCarlson repeatedly promoted a conspiracy theory that pro-Trump protestor Ray Epps was actually a federal agent engaged in a false flag operation to instigate the January 6 attack. Epps said he and his wife were subjected to threats and harassment, leading them to sell their home and business to go into hiding in another state. An attorney for Epps wrote Carlson in March 2023 demanding a public retraction of \"false and defamatory statements.\"[525][526][527]\n\nPatriot Purge program\nIn late October 2021, Patriot Purge, a three-part series produced by Carlson, was released on the Fox Nation streaming service. Carlson broadcast a trailer that suggested the January 6 attack was a government false flag operation to implicate the right wing, with one speaker asserting that \"the left is hunting the right\". Carlson stated on-air that the government had \"launched a new war\" on American citizens and characterized his series as \"rock-solid factually\".[528] Fact-checkers found the series contained numerous falsehoods and conspiracy theories. Michael Jensen, a senior researcher at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, called it \"political propaganda that is meant to rally a support base that has shown a willingness to mobilize on the basis of disinformation and lies. That's how we got Jan. 6 in the first place.\"[19][529] Conservative writers Jonah Goldberg and Steve Hayes responded to the series by severing their ties to Fox News, declaring that the series was \"a collection of incoherent conspiracy-mongering, riddled with factual inaccuracies, half-truths, deceptive imagery, and damning omissions\".[530][531] Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, prominent anchors in the network's news division, raised objections to the series to top executives of the Fox organization.[531]\n\nAlleged surveillance\nIn October 2020, Carlson alleged on his show that someone was reading his text messages, after documents he claimed had compromising information on Joe Biden's son, Hunter, were lost by the United Parcel Service and then quickly located.[532][533][534] Carlson did not say what these documents contained.[534] In November 2021, the Daily Mail published emails from a laptop owned by Hunter Biden, which appear to demonstrate a friendship between himself and Carlson.[535]\nOn June 28, 2021, Carlson said on his program that \"a whistleblower within the U.S. government\" informed him that the National Security Agency (NSA) was \"monitoring our electronic communications and is planning to leak them in an attempt to take this show off the air\", adding, \"The Biden administration is spying on us. We have confirmed that.\"[536] That same day, a producer for Carlson filed an unusually broad Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the NSA, seeking records, including \"any communication between NSA officials regarding journalist Tucker Carlson\", dating back to January 2019, before Biden became president.[537][e] On June 29, the NSA tweeted a rare statement of denial,[536][539] stating that Carlson has never been a target of its surveillance and it never had any intent to have his program taken off the air.[540] Carlson responded on-air that the NSA did not deny reading his emails.[541][f] House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy asked House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes to investigate.[542]\nAxios reported on July 7 that, shortly before Carlson made his allegation, he had been in contact with U.S.-based Kremlin intermediaries to arrange an interview with Vladimir Putin. The reporter of the Axios exclusive story, Jonathan Swan, later confirmed he had contacted Carlson seeking pre-publication comment, but said he had not told Carlson that anyone had shared the email contents with him.[543][544] On that night's program, Carlson said that he had contacted people about interviewing Putin, but did not mention it to anyone because he did not want to \"rattle the Russians, and make the interview less likely to happen\". He said that the NSA had unmasked his identity and that \"the contents of my emails left that building at the NSA and wound up with a news organization\".[545][546] On July 23, cybersecurity news website The Record wrote that Carlson had not been targeted by the NSA but had been unmasked after he was mentioned by third parties who were under surveillance, citing two anonymous sources. Fox News called the reported act \"unacceptable\".[547] The New York Times observed there was a distinction between Carlson's communications being intercepted by the NSA and intercepts of foreigners who were discussing Carlson.[544] The NSA inspector general's office announced in August 2021 that it was examining Carlson's allegation.[548]\n\nRhetorical style\nCarlson's rhetorical style and debating tactics have drawn close attention from writers and other public figures.[1][52][3][549][550]\nIn arguments, Carlson can quickly shift between personas as a devil's advocate and a moralizing truth teller, and simultaneously appear outraged and blas\u00e9\u00a0\u2013  a use of contradiction that Lili Loofbourow, writing for Slate, referred to as a \"joking/not-joking loophole\" historically used by radio shock jocks.[549] James Carville, a Democratic strategist and friend of Carlson who has appeared on his shows, called Carlson \"one of the world's great contrarians\". Touching upon this, Kelefa Sanneh, writing for The New Yorker said that one of Carlson's gifts is to make any position he takes on an issue \"seem like a brave rebellion against someone else's way of thinking.\"[3]\nCarlson has said he especially targets the \"moral preening\" of people he sees as having a sensibility of \"I'm a really good person, and you're not.\"[1] According to Philip Bump of The Washington Post, Carlson presents his perceived opponents \"as endlessly cynical and duplicitous\", and agitates his audience against them by cherry-picking and misinterpreting information.[551][552] Charlotte Alter of Time wrote that Carlson \"sanitizes and legitimizes right-wing conspiratorial thinking, dodges when you try to nail him down on the specifics, then wraps it all in an argument about censorship and free speech\".[15] Elaina Plott in The Atlantic summed up Carlson's style as \"a gleeful fuck you\" to his opponents.[1]\nDuring remote interviews, Carlson's producers will keep his face close-up onscreen so viewers can watch him react, often in disbelief.[3] His trademark scowl lets viewers \"share his disdain\" toward opposing views, foreshadowing a \"scathing rebuttal\".[550][553] Carlson is known to interrupt guests repeatedly with direct demands to answer questions he poses, sometimes focusing on an embarrassing episode or statement from a guest's past.[550] Jack Shafer wrote in Politico that \"When the host barks questions in your earpiece, you can't help but jolt to life like a puppet on a string\", suggesting that successful guests on Carlson's show must match his quick-wittedness and unflappability.[550] Lyz Lenz of the Columbia Journalism Review wrote that this debate maneuver mirrors Jon Stewart's confrontation of Carlson on Crossfire in 2004, describing Stewart then and Carlson now as both \"com[ing] out of the gate with an impossible line of questioning and a disingenuous defense\".[52]\nCharlotte Alter of Time wrote in July 2021 that Carlson sometimes tells \"outright falsehoods\", but generally \"avoids assertions that are factually disprovable, instead sticking to innuendo\". As an example, Alter wrote that Carlson did not endorse Sidney Powell's specific claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, but he did say, \"The people now telling us to stop asking questions about voting machines are the same ones who claim that our phones weren't listening to us\".[15] In September 2020, on The Rubin Report, Carlson said that, unlike TV newscasters who he said \"systematically lie\", he will only lie \"if I'm really cornered or something\", saying, \"I lie. I really try not to. I try never to lie on TV. ... I don't like lying. I certainly do it, you know, out of weakness or whatever.\"[554] Bump argued in 2022 that compared with other television anchors, Carlson is loath to acknowledge factual errors in his commentary.[22]\nCarlson's use of hyperbole as a rhetorical device was cited by Fox News in its successful defense in 2020 of a slander lawsuit by Karen McDougal, after Carlson incorrectly argued in 2018 that Donald Trump had been a victim of extortion by McDougal.[167][168][555]\nCarlson describes George Orwell as his favorite writer and cites Strunk and White's The Elements of Style as having an influence on his writing.[121]\n\nReception\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Carlson has been \"recognized for his success in helping to bring far-right viewpoints and vocabulary into the mainstream of American politics\" through his promotion of \"extreme positions on a range of political and social issues, for his embrace of white nationalism, for his support of authoritarian leaders of other countries, and for his regular reliance on arguably false or misleading claims, including baseless conspiracy theories\" and for \"exert[ing] an unusual influence on Republican Pres. Donald Trump, who was a regular viewer of Carlson's show.\"[11] In 2021, Time said that Carlson could be the most powerful conservative in America, with Republican strategist Jeff Roe adding, \"He doesn't react to the agenda, he drives the agenda.\"[15] Mediaite named Carlson the most influential person in news media in 2021.[556][557]\nTina Brown, the former editor of Vanity Fair and a former colleague of Carlson, said: \"Tucker is a tremendously good writer and I always thought it was a real shame that he kind of got sucked into this TV mania thing.\"[52]\nOn February 23, 2017, The Atlantic wrote that \"Carlson's true talent is not for political philosophizing, it's for televised partisan combat. His go-to weapons\u2014the smirky sarcasm, the barbed comebacks, the vicious politeness\u2014seem uniquely designed to drive his sparring partners nuts, frequently making for terrific television\".[41]\nOn September 19, 2017, journalist Stephen Rodrick wrote in a GQ profile of Carlson: \"On his show, Carlson mocks and verbally body-slams those who disagree with him, a passel of easy marks such as Democratic politicians, well-meaning liberal activists, and young reporters. He shares with Donald Trump a deep reluctance to apologize for his mistakes, and he lobs insults that seem suspiciously like subconscious self-assessments: He loves to accuse his guests of 'preening', and he derides 'pomposity, smugness, and groupthink'.\"[89]\nIn an interview for a 2021 Time profile of Carlson, a former NewsCorp executive, Alex Azam, described Carlson as having some impunity within Fox News, \"because of the signal that touching him would send to the viewers that Fox never wants to lose\".[15] In 2021, he was included in the Time 100, Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[558]\nIn April 2022, The New York Times published a three-part 20,000-word investigative series on Carlson called \"American Nationalist\". The investigative series documents Carlson's rise to prominence and his rhetoric on immigration, race relations and the COVID-19 pandemic, describing Tucker Carlson Tonight as \"what may be the most racist show in the history of cable news \u2014 and also, by some measures, the most successful.\"[10][559][560][232][561] Carlson responded by saying that he has not read \"American Nationalist\" and does not plan to. He also denied allegations from the Times about obsessing over ratings, saying that \"I've never read the ratings a single day in my life. I don't even know how. Ask anyone at Fox.\" He also claimed to have taken positions unpopular with his audience, saying, \"Most of the big positions I've taken in the past five years \u2014 against the neocons, the vax and the war [in Ukraine] \u2014 have been very unpopular with our audience at first.\"[559]\n\nPersonal life\nCarlson is married to Susan Thomson Carlson (n\u00e9e\u00a0Andrews).[52][562] They met at St. George's School, where she was the daughter of the school's headmaster and priest.[75][563] They were married on August 10, 1991, in the school chapel.[562] They have four children.[68][564] Carlson is left-handed and dyslexic.[121]\nCarlson was baptized as an Episcopalian but has said he grew up with secular beliefs; he credits his wife for his religious faith.[563] In 2013, Carlson said, \"We still go to the Episcopal Church for all kinds of complicated reasons, but I truly despise the Episcopal Church in a lot of ways,\" citing his opposition to the church's support for same-sex marriage and abortion rights.[563] He has said he stays in the church because he \"loves the liturgy\" and \"likes the people\".[563][3]\nCarlson quit drinking alcohol in 2002.[3] A few years earlier, he quit smoking cigarettes (a habit dating to eighth grade) and took up nicotine gum, which he \"chews constantly\", and nicotine pouches.[3][121] Carlson is a Deadhead (a fan of the rock band Grateful Dead); he has attended more than fifty Dead concerts,[565] and the title of his 2018 book Ship of Fools was inspired by the Grateful Dead song of the same name.[121]\nIn 2011, a group of protesters gathered outside his house in Kent, Washington, D.C.,[566] to protest Carlson. In 2017, Carlson sold his home and purchased another nearby.[567] In late 2018, protestors gathered in front of their home. In 2020, Carlson sold his home in Kent and bought a house on Gasparilla Island, on Florida's Gulf Coast, and in the summer of 2022, a second home next door.[568][569][570]\nThey now also live part of the year in Maine near his \"favorite place in the world\", Bryant Pond, Woodstock, Maine.[571]\nIn September 2022, Carlson spoke at the funeral of Hells Angels president Sonny Barger. Carlson said that he had been a fan of Barger since his college years, quoted Barger as saying \"stay loyal, remain free, and always value honor\", and added \"I want to pay tribute to the man who spoke those words\".[572][573]\n\nPublished works\nCarlson, Tucker (2003).

It's not how white men fight. Yet suddenly I found myself rooting for the mob against the man, hoping they'd hit him harder, kill him. I really wanted them to hurt the kid. I could taste it. Then somewhere deep in my brain, an alarm went off: this isn't good for me. I'm becoming something I don't want to be. The Antifa creep is a human being. Much as I despise what he says and does, much as I'm sure I'd hate him personally if I knew him, I shouldn't gloat over his suffering. I should be bothered by it.

W. Bush from 1991 to 1993 and again in the administration of President Donald Trump from 2019 to 2020.\nBorn and raised in New York City, Barr was educated at the Horace Mann School, Columbia University, and George Washington University Law School. From 1971 to 1977, Barr was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency. He then served as a law clerk to judge Malcolm Richard Wilkey of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In the 1980s, Barr worked for the law firm Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, with one year's work in the White House of the Ronald Reagan administration dealing with legal policies. Before becoming attorney general in 1991, Barr held numerous other posts within the Department of Justice, including leading the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) and serving as deputy attorney general. From 1994 to 2008, Barr did corporate legal work for GTE and its successor company Verizon Communications, which made him a multimillionaire. From 2009 to 2018, Barr served on the board of directors for Time Warner.\nBarr is a longtime proponent of the unitary executive theory of nearly unfettered presidential authority over the executive branch of the U.S. government.[1][2][3] In 1989, Barr, as the head of the OLC, justified the U.S. invasion of Panama to arrest Manuel Noriega. As deputy attorney general, Barr authorized an FBI operation in 1991 which freed hostages at the Talladega federal prison. An influential advocate for tougher criminal justice policies, Barr as attorney general in 1992 authored the report The Case for More Incarceration, where he argued for an increase in the United States incarceration rate.[4] Under Barr's advice, President George H. W. Bush in 1992 pardoned six officials involved in the Iran\u2013Contra affair.\nBarr became attorney general for the second time in 2019. During his term, he received criticism from many for his handling of several challenges, including his letter on the Mueller report, interventions in the convictions and sentences of former advisors to President Trump, Roger Stone and Michael Flynn,[5][6] his order of the federal government to resume federal executions after 17 years,[7][8] and allegations of political interference in the removal of Geoffrey Berman from his Southern District of New York attorney position in a matter pertaining to the indictment of Turkish bank Halkbank, a bank with close personal ties to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.[9][10] On December 1, 2020, Barr stated FBI and Justice Department investigations found no evidence of irregularities that would have changed the outcome of the presidential election.[11] Barr is the second person to ever serve two non-consecutive terms as U.S. Attorney General, after John J. Crittenden.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBarr was born in New York City in 1950. His father, Donald Barr, taught English literature at Columbia University before becoming headmaster of the Dalton School in Manhattan and later the Hackley School in Tarrytown, New York, both members of the Ivy Preparatory School League. Barr's mother, Mary Margaret (n\u00e9e Ahern), also taught at Columbia.[12] Barr's father was raised Jewish but later converted to the Roman Catholic Church. His mother is of Irish Catholic ancestry. Barr was raised as a Catholic.[13][14] Barr was the second of four sons, and his younger brother Stephen Barr is a professor of physics at the University of Delaware.[15]\nBarr grew up on New York City's Upper West Side. As a child, he attended a Catholic grammar school, Corpus Christi School, and then the non-sectarian Horace Mann School. After high school, he attended Columbia University, where he majored in government and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1971. Barr was also an active member in the Sigma Nu fraternity. He did two additional years of graduate study at Columbia, receiving a Master of Arts in government and Chinese studies in 1973. While at Columbia, Barr opposed anti-Vietnam War occupation protests by students on campus.[16]\nAfter moving to Washington, D.C., to work as an intelligence analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Barr entered the evening student program at George Washington University Law School. He graduated in 1977 with a Juris Doctor with highest honors.[17][18]\n\nCareer[edit]\nEarly career[edit]\nBarr with President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office in 1983\nBarr worked for the CIA from 1971 to 1977 while attending graduate school and law school.[19] He was first hired as a summer intern for two years.[16] During his law school years he was an analyst in the Intelligence Directorate division from 1973 to 1975, and then transitioning to an assistant in the Office of Legislative Counsel and an agency liaison to Congress from 1975 to 1977.[19][20][21]\nAfter graduating from law school in 1977, Barr spent one year as a law clerk to Judge Malcolm Wilkey of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.[22][17] He then joined the law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge (now Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman) from 1978 to 1982 and again from 1983 to 1989,[22] after serving as Deputy Assistant Director for Legal Policy on the domestic policy staff at the Reagan White House from May 1982 to September 1983.[22][17][23]\nBarr has never prosecuted a case.[24][25]\n\nU.S. Department of Justice[edit]\nBarr and Dan Quayle watch as President George H. W. Bush signs the Civil Rights Commission Reauthorization Act in the Rose Garden of the White House in 1991.\nIn 1989, at the beginning of his administration, President George H. W. Bush appointed Barr to the U.S. Department of Justice as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), an office which functions as the legal advisor for the President and executive agencies. Barr was known as a strong defender of presidential power.[26] He wrote an advisory opinion justifying the U.S. invasion of Panama and arrest of Manuel Noriega.[26] He wrote legal justifications for the practice of rendition,[27] so that the FBI could enter onto foreign soil without the consent of the host government to apprehend fugitives wanted by the United States government for terrorism or drug-trafficking.[26] Barr declined a congressional request for the full 1989 opinion, but instead provided a document that \"summarizes the principal conclusions\". Congress subpoenaed the opinion, and its public release after Barr's departure from the Justice Department showed he had omitted significant findings in the opinion from his summary document.[28]\n\nU.S. Deputy Attorney General (1990\u20131991)[edit]\nIn May 1990, Barr was appointed Deputy Attorney General, the official responsible for day-to-day management of the department. According to media reports, Barr was generally praised for his professional management of the department.[29][30][31]\nDuring August 1991, when then-Attorney General Richard Thornburgh resigned to campaign for the Senate, Barr was named Acting Attorney General.[32] Three days after Barr accepted that position, 121 Cuban inmates, awaiting deportation to Cuba, seized nine hostages at the Talladega federal prison. He directed the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team to assault the prison, which resulted in rescuing all hostages without loss of life.[33][34]\n\nU.S. Attorney General (1991\u20131993)[edit]\nOfficial photo of Barr during his first tenure as Attorney General\nFirst nomination and confirmation[edit]\nIt was reported that President Bush was impressed with Barr's management of the hostage crisis; weeks later, Bush nominated him as attorney general.[35]\nBarr enjoyed a \"sterling reputation\" among Republican and Democratic politicians alike.[36] His two-day confirmation hearing was \"unusually placid\", and he was received well by both Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee.[37] Asked whether he thought a constitutional right to privacy included the right to an abortion, Barr responded that he believed the Constitution was not originally intended to create a right to abortion; that Roe v. Wade was thus wrongly decided; and that abortion should be a \"legitimate issue for state legislators\".[37] Barr also said at the hearings that Roe v. Wade was \"the law of the land\" and claimed he did not have \"fixed or settled views\" on abortion.[38] Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Joe Biden, though disagreeing with Barr, responded that it was the \"first candid answer\" he had heard from a nominee on a question that witnesses would normally evade; Biden hailed Barr as \"a throwback to the days when we actually had attorneys general that would talk to you\".[39] Barr was approved unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee, was confirmed by voice vote by the full Senate,[40][41] and was sworn in as attorney general on November 26, 1991.[42]\n\nFirst tenure[edit]\nDuring his first tenure as AG, media characterized Barr as \"a staunch conservative who rarely hesitates to put his hardline views into action\".[43][44][45] He was described as affable with a dry, self-deprecating wit.[43][46] The New York Times described the \"central theme\" of his tenure to be \"his contention that violent crime can be reduced only by expanding Federal and state prisons to jail habitual violent offenders\".[44] In an effort to prioritize violent crime, Barr reassigned three hundred FBI agents from counterintelligence work to investigations of gang violence. The New York Times called this move \"the largest single manpower shift in the bureau's history\".[44]\nDuring the 1992 election year, The Wall Street Journal wrote of Barr's work that he \"has put a heavy emphasis on attention-grabbing events and pronouncements that may have more to do with presidential election-year politicking than with fighting crime on the streets.\"[47][48]\n\nThe Case for More Incarceration[edit]\nThe Case for More Incarceration\nIn 1992, Barr authored a report, The Case for More Incarceration,[49] which argued for an increase in the United States incarceration rate, the creation of a national program to construct more prisons, and the abolition of parole release.[4] Barr argued that incarceration reduced crime, pointing to crime and incarceration rates in 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990. A 1999 criminology study criticized Barr's analysis, saying \"so complex an issue as the relationship between crime and punishment cannot be addressed through so simplistic an analysis as a negative correlation between the two very aggregated time series of crime rates and incarceration rates.\"[50] University of Minnesota criminologist Michael Tonry said the data in Barr's report was deceptively presented; if Barr had chosen five-year intervals, then the data would not have supported Barr's argument, and if Barr had chosen to look at violent crime specifically (as opposed to all crimes as a category), then the data would not have supported his argument.[51]\nBarr said in the report, \"The benefits of increased incarceration would be enjoyed disproportionately by black Americans.\"[51] In the report, Barr approvingly quoted New Mexico Attorney General Hal Stratton, \"I don't know anyone [who] goes to prison on their first crime. By the time you go to prison, you are a pretty bad guy.\"[52] Barr's report influenced the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which aimed to increase the incarceration rate.[4]\n\nInvestigations[edit]\nIn October 1991, Barr appointed then-retired Democratic Chicago judge Nicholas Bua as special counsel in the Inslaw scandal. Bua's 1993 report found the Department of Justice guilty of no wrongdoing in the matter.[53]\nIn October 1992, Barr appointed then retired New Jersey federal judge Frederick B. Lacey to investigate the Department of Justice and the Central Intelligence Agency handling of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqgate scandal.[54] The appointment came after Democrats called for a special prosecutor during the scandal fearing a \"cover-up\" by the administration. House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonz\u00e1lez called for Barr's resignation, citing \"repeated, clear failures and obstruction\" by the Department of Justice in allegedly delaying an investigation of the BNL-Iraqgate case.[55][56] Gonz\u00e1lez also called for an independent special counsel investigation.[56]\n\nBank of Credit and Commerce International[edit]\nIn July 1991, regulators in seven countries shut down the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), after investigators uncovered that the decentralized and poorly regulated bank, which was allegedly run by Saudi and possibly Pakistani Intelligence, was involved in fraud and money laundering operations for criminal organizations, corrupt governments, and intelligence agencies. BCCI managed to circumvent Federal Reserve controls to buy the bank holding company First American Bankshares, allowing direct access to American financial institutions.[57] Several sources have alleged that the CIA had been aware of BCCI's activities and its purchase of First American, but since the CIA, DIA, and the NSC utilized BCCI accounts for covert operations and since the Saudi's provided intelligence to the CIA from BCCI's illicit activities (see Safari Club), the CIA worked with Barr to prevent any investigation of BCCI, which was directed by Assistant Attorney General Robert Mueller since 1986 (other sources claim 1983).[58]\nAfter the bank was shut down in 1991, Barr testified in congress that the investigation had \"coordination\" problems and promised to remedy the issue but other federal prosecutors claim Barr actively thwarted several indictments of BCCI in Florida, when the Customs Service discovered that CenTrust Bank of Miami was a front for BCCI and possibly Saudi Intelligence. The American investigation of BCCI was taken over by Senator John Kerry after discovering the bank during drug trafficking investigations. After becoming impatient with the slow pace and inaction of the Justice Department under Barr, Kerry had the investigation turned over to New York State District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who managed to extract a plea agreement with BCCI for various criminal violations and the indictment of First American Chairman Clark Clifford.[57]\n\nPhone surveillance program[edit]\nIn 1992, Barr launched a surveillance program to gather records of innocent Americans' international phone calls.[59] The purpose of the DEA program was to collect \"bulk logs of outgoing international phone calls from the United States to countries deemed to be linked to narcotics trafficking\" through \"issuing administrative subpoenas to phone companies\"[60] According to USA Today, the program \"provided a blueprint for far broader phone-data surveillance the government launched after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001\".[59] The DoJ inspector general concluded that this program had been launched without a review of its legality and made 16 recommendations including areas relating to subpoena procedures and guidance training materials.[61]\nIn December 2019, Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Patrick J. Leahy asked the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate Barr for approving the program, accusing Barr of \u201can illegal, bulk surveillance program\u201d alleging \u201cwithout conducting any legal analysis\u201d.[62]\n\nIran-Contra[edit]\nIn late 1992, Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh, who had been chosen to investigate the Iran\u2013Contra affair, found documents in the possession of Reagan's former defense secretary, Caspar Weinberger, which Walsh said was \"evidence of a conspiracy among the highest-ranking Reagan Administration officials to lie to Congress and the American public\".[63][64] Weinberger was set to stand trial on felony charges on January 5, 1993.[63][65] His \"indictment said Mr. Weinberger's notes contradicted Mr. Bush's assertions that he had only a fragmentary knowledge of the arms secretly sold to Iran in 1985 and 1986 in exchange for American hostages in Lebanon.\"[65][64][66] According to Walsh, then-president Bush might have been called as a witness.[67]\nOn December 24, 1992, during his final month in office, Bush, on the advice of Barr, pardoned Weinberger,[17][68] along with five other administration officials who had been found guilty on charges relating to the Iran\u2013Contra affair.[17][69][70][63] Barr was consulted extensively regarding the pardons, and especially advocated for pardoning Weinberger.[71]\nWalsh complained about the move, insinuating that Bush on Barr's advice had used the pardons to avoid testifying and stating that: \"The Iran-contra cover-up, which has continued for more than six years, has now been completed.\"[72] In 2003, he wrote an account of the investigation in his book, Firewall: The Iran-Contra Conspiracy and Cover-Up.\nBecause of this and Barr's unwillingness to appoint an independent counsel to look into a second scandal known as Iraqgate, New York Times writer William Safire began to refer to Barr as \"Coverup-General Barr\", accusing Barr of concealing George H. W. Bush's involvement in Iraqgate and the Iran\u2013Contra affair.[73][74] Barr, however, responded that he believed Bush had made the right decision regarding that and he felt people in the case had been treated unfairly.[75] Barr said Walsh was a \"head-hunter\" who \"had completely lost perspective\".[2]\n\nPost-Bush career[edit]\nUpon leaving the DOJ in 1993, Barr was appointed by Virginia Governor George Allen to co-chair a commission to implement tougher criminal justice policies and abolish parole in the state.[76][77] Barr has been described as a \"leader of the parole-abolition campaign\" in Virginia.[78]\nAfter leaving the DOJ, he criticized the Clinton administration for being \"soft on crime\".[79] Barr expressed his opposition to efforts to end mandatory minimum sentencing.[79] In a 1993 op-ed, he wrote, \"The notion that there are sympathetic people out there who become hapless victims of the criminal-justice system and are locked away in federal prison beyond the time they deserve is simply a myth.\"[80][79] In a 1995 essay, Barr rejected that crime was caused by material factors, such as poverty, arguing instead that crime was caused by immorality: \"Spending more money on these material social programs is not going to have an impact on crime, and, if anything, it will exacerbate the problem.\"[80]\nIn 1994, Barr became Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the telecommunications company GTE Corporation, where he served for 14 years. During his corporate tenure, Barr directed a successful litigation campaign by the local telephone industry to achieve deregulation by scuttling a series of FCC rules, personally arguing several cases in the federal courts of appeals and the Supreme Court.[81][82] In 2000, when GTE merged with Bell Atlantic to become Verizon Communications, Barr became the general counsel and executive vice president of Verizon until he retired in 2008.[83] Barr became a multimillionaire from working in GTE and Verizon. In 2001, Barr's salary was reportedly $1.5\u00a0million.[16]\nFrom 1997 to 2000, Barr served on the Board of Visitors of the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg.[84]\nIn 2009, Barr was briefly of counsel to the firm Kirkland & Ellis. From 2010 until 2017, he advised corporations on government enforcement matters and regulatory litigation; he rejoined Kirkland and Ellis in 2017.[85]\nFrom 2009 to 2018, Barr served on the board of directors for Time Warner.[86]\n\nComments about the Starr investigation of President Clinton[edit]\nIn March 1998, Barr lambasted the Clinton administration for criticizing Independent Counsel Ken Starr's investigation of the Whitewater controversy, which had shifted towards an investigation of an alleged affair between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.[2] Barr said the criticism appeared \"to have the improper purpose of influencing and impeding an ongoing criminal investigation and intimidating possible jurors, witnesses and even investigators\".[2]\n\nComments about the Trump administration[edit]\nOn April 18, 2019, a redacted version of Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election was released to the public.\nDuring the first two years of the Trump presidency, Barr frequently criticized legal challenges against Trump and investigations into the Trump 2016 campaign and presidency.[87][88]\nIn 2017, Barr said there was \"nothing inherently wrong\" with Donald Trump's calls for investigating Hillary Clinton while the two were both running for president. Barr added that an investigation into an alleged Uranium One controversy was more warranted than looking into whether Trump conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 elections.[89] Barr also said in 2017 that he did not think \"all this stuff\" about incarcerating or prosecuting Hillary Clinton was appropriate to say, but added that \"there are things that should be investigated that haven't been investigated,\" although the FBI began investigating the Clinton Foundation and the related Uranium One matter in 2015, followed by investigations by Republican congressional committees.[90][91][92]\nIn February 2017, Barr argued Trump was justified in firing Acting Attorney General Sally Yates over her refusal to defend Executive Order 13769.[93]\nBarr was publicly critical of the special counsel investigation. In 2017, he faulted Mueller for hiring prosecutors who have contributed to Democratic politicians, saying that his team should have had more \"balance\", and characterized the obstruction of justice investigation as \"asinine\" and that it was \"taking on the look of an entirely political operation to overthrow the president\".[94][95]\nIn June 2018, Barr sent an unsolicited 20-page memo to senior Justice Department officials. He also provided copies to members of Trump's legal team and discussed it with some of them.[96] In his memo, Barr argued that the Special Counsel should not be investigating Trump for obstruction of justice because Trump's actions, such as firing FBI Director James Comey, were within his powers as head of the executive branch.[97][98][99] He characterized the obstruction investigation as \"fatally misconceived\" and \"grossly irresponsible\" and \"potentially disastrous\" to the executive branch.[100][98] The day after the existence of the memo became known, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said \"our decisions are informed by our knowledge of the actual facts of the case, which Mr. Barr didn't have.\"[101] Democrats later characterized the memo as Barr's \"job application\" for the attorney general position.[102]\n\nPolitical donations[edit]\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) financially assists Republicans in their Senate election contests; in the seven years from 2009 to 2016, Barr gave six donations to the NRSC totaling $85,400. In a five-month period from October 2018 to February 2019, Barr donated five times (around $10,000 every month) for a total of $51,000. When Barr started donating more frequently to the NRSC, it was uncertain whether then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions would remain in his job. Barr continued donating even after Sessions resigned, and after Trump nominated Barr for Attorney General. The donations stopped after Barr was confirmed by the Senate as attorney general. NRSC refunded Barr $30,000 before his confirmation. Previously in 2017, Barr had said he felt \"prosecutors who make political contributions are identifying fairly strongly with a political party.\"[103]\n\nU.S. Attorney General (2019\u20132020)[edit]\nSecond nomination and confirmation[edit]\nBarr is sworn in as Attorney General by Chief Justice John Roberts in 2019.On December 7, 2018, President Donald Trump announced Barr's nomination to succeed Jeff Sessions.[104][105] Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman reported that Trump had sought Barr as chief defense lawyer for Trump regarding the special counsel investigation headed by Robert Mueller after Barr made three positions known. First, Barr supported Trump's firing of Comey on May 9, 2017. Second, he questioned the appointments of some of Mueller's prosecutors due to political donations they had made to the Clinton campaign. Third, he alleged there were conflicts of interest of two appointees to the Special Counsel Team, Jennie Rhee and Bruce Ohr.[106][107][108]\nBarr was confirmed as attorney general on February 14, 2019, by a 54\u201345 near party-line vote, with Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) as the three Democrats to vote Yea. Republican senator Rand Paul (R-KY) voted No and Richard Burr (R-NC) did not vote.[109][110] Later that day, Barr was sworn in as the nation's 85th Attorney General by Chief Justice John Roberts in a ceremony at the White House.[111] He is the first person to be appointed to a second non-consecutive term as attorney general since John J. Crittenden in 1850.[112]\n\nSecond tenure[edit]\nIn May 2019, three months into his tenure as attorney general, the Associated Press characterized Barr as a champion and advocate for Trump.[113] Barr had enthusiastically supported Trump's political agenda, misrepresented aspects of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, repeated Trump's assertion that those investigating Trump had engaged in spying, defied congressional subpoenas, and refused to give Congress an unredacted version of the Mueller report.[113]\nUnder Barr's leadership, the Justice Department changed its position on the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Previously the department took the position that the individual mandate provision was unconstitutional, but could be severed from the whole healthcare law. On March 25, the department updated its position to argue that the entire law was unconstitutional.[114] On May 2, the department conducted a filing with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to nullify the entire law, arguing that the removal of the provision on individual mandate results in the entire law becoming unconstitutional.[115]\nAlso in July 2019, Barr reportedly made the decision to not bring federal civil rights charges against New York policeman Daniel Pantaleo for causing the death of Eric Garner. In so doing, he overruled the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which advocated charging Pantaleo, instead agreeing with Justice Department prosecutors from New York.[116]\nOn July 25, 2019, Barr ordered the resumption of federal executions.[117]\nOn July 8, 2019, Barr announced his recusal from the Justice Department's review of the 2008 federal prosecution of American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.[118] On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found unresponsive in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC).[119] Barr later announced that Justice Department officials were \ninvestigating \"serious irregularities\" at the Metropolitan Correctional Center.[120]\n\nIn mid-August 2019, Barr had a rare face-to-face meeting with Trump and Giuliani associates Joseph diGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing, who since earlier that year represented former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin and pro-Russia Ukrainian oligarch Dmytry Firtash as attorneys. Trump had announced in March 2018 that diGenova and Toensing would join his legal defense team during the Mueller investigation; the appointments were withdrawn days later, though Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow said they might assist in other legal matters. DiGenova has said he has known Barr for thirty years, as they both worked in the Reagan Justice Department. Since 2014, Firtash had been fighting extradition to the United States under a federal indictment while he was living in Austria after being arrested there and released on $155 million bail, and diGenova and Toensing sought to have Barr drop the charges. Firtash was a middleman for importing Russian natural gas into Ukraine and has said he was installed in that role by Russian organized crime boss Semion Mogilevich; Russian president Vladimir Putin reportedly agreed to the appointment. When he was vice president, Joe Biden had urged Ukraine to eliminate middlemen such as Firtash and to reduce the country's reliance on imports of Russian natural gas. Giuliani had directed associate Lev Parnas to approach Firtash with a recommendation to hire diGenova and Toensing, with the proposition that Firtash could help provide damaging information on Biden, which Parnas's attorney described was \"part of any potential resolution to [Firtash's] extradition matter.\" DiGenova and Toensing obtained a September 2019 statement[121] from Shokin that made false assertions about corruption by Biden. The statement noted that it was prepared \"at the request of lawyers acting for Dmitry Firtash ('DF'), for use in legal proceedings in Austria.\" Giuliani promoted the statement in television appearances as purported evidence of wrongdoing by Biden. Prior to meeting with diGenova and Toensing, Barr had been briefed in detail on the initial Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal whistleblower complaint within the CIA that had been forwarded to the Justice Department, as well as on Giuliani's activities in Ukraine. Barr declined to intervene in the Firtash case. Bloomberg News  reported that its sources told them Giuliani's high-profile publicity of the Shokin statement had greatly reduced the chances of the Justice Department dropping the charges against Firtash, as it would appear to be a political quid pro quo.[122]Barr discusses the shooting at Pensacola Naval Air Station, 13 January 2020.In October 2019, as Trump faced an impeachment inquiry about the Trump-Ukraine scandal, Barr met with Fox Corporation chairman  Rupert Murdoch at his Manhattan home. Trump reportedly was angered by a recent Fox News poll showing a majority of Americans supported his impeachment and removal from office, as well as analysis of the scandal by Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano, a previous Trump ally who had argued the president should be impeached. Trump reportedly directed Barr to meet with Murdoch, and it was not immediately known what the men discussed, but CNN media analyst Brian Stelter wrote in his 2020 book about Fox News that silencing Napolitano was among the topics discussed. The meeting was one day after Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Trump and Giuliani, were arrested as they prepared to fly to Vienna to arrange an interview between Fox News host Sean Hannity and Shokin, who had made false corruption allegations about Joe Biden, a potential challenger to Trump in the 2020 presidential election.[123][124][125][126]\nIn December 2019, Barr said that communities that do not show the \"respect and support that law enforcement deserves\u00a0... might find themselves without the police protection they need.\"[127] Barr dropped the Department of Justice's case against the police officer who killed Eric Garner in 2014.[16]\nIn February 2020, Senator Lindsey Graham stated that the Justice Department \"is receiving information coming out of the Ukraine from\" Rudy Giuliani, a personal lawyer to president Donald Trump. Graham had learned from Barr that \"they've created a process that Rudy could give information and they would see if it's verified.\" A day later, Barr confirmed Graham's account, stating that he had \"established an intake process\" for information on Ukraine, including from Giuliani, while citing an \"obligation to have an open door\" policy on receiving information. Giuliani has claimed to have information of improprieties regarding Ukraine for Joe Biden (a former vice president, later a 2020 presidential candidate) and his son Hunter Biden. Giuliani himself is reportedly being investigated by the Justice Department, with two of his associates having been arrested.[128][129][130]\nBarr has made commentary about social and religious issues in speeches and television appearances. In an October 2019 address at the University of Notre Dame, Barr asserted that \"militant secularists\" had been attacking Judeo-Christian values for five decades, stating, \"This is not decay. This is organized destruction. Secular forces and their allies have marshaled all the forces of mass communication, popular culture, the entertainment industry, and academia, in an unremitting assault on religion and traditional values.\"[131]\nBarr has sometimes supported controversial or false statements made by Trump.[132]\nOn September 21, 2020, Barr joined Advisor Ivanka Trump, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, First Lady Marty Kemp, and Tim Tebow in Atlanta to announce $100 million in grant funding for victims of human trafficking.[133]\nOn December 21, 2020, Barr announced federal charges against Mohammed Abouagela Masud for building the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103. Barr had taken an interest in solving that case, both during and between his tenures as attorney general.[134]\nIn May 2021, federal judge Beryl Howell unsealed documents showing that in November 2020 the Barr DOJ persuaded a grand jury to subpoena Twitter for information to identify who operated a parody Twitter account, @NunesAlt, that mocked Republican congressman and ardent Trump ally Devin Nunes. Twitter was also issued a gag order in the matter. Challenging the subpoena, the company noted Nunes's history of litigation and argued that the subpoena appeared to be a government attempt to aid his efforts to retaliate against his critics, and violated the First Amendment. The DOJ cited 18USC\u00a7875(c)[135] that prohibits threats, but did not provide any examples of threats to Twitter attorneys. CNN reported that investigators sought information about several online accounts relating to threats against senator Mitch McConnell. The DOJ withdrew the subpoena one week after Twitter challenged it to Howell, who oversees federal grand juries, in March 2021.[136][137][138][139] Prior to Barr's second tenure, the Trump Justice Department in 2017 and 2018 subpoenaed metadata from the iCloud accounts of at least a dozen individuals associated with the House Intelligence Committee, including that of ranking Democratic member Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, and family members, to investigate leaks to the press about contacts between Trump associates and Russia.[140][141]\n\nMueller investigation and report[edit]\nFurther information: Mueller special counsel investigation and Mueller Report\nOn January 14, 2019, a day before Barr's confirmation hearing for attorney general, Barr sent written testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the eventual final Mueller report, saying \"it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the special counsel's work\u00a0... For that reason, my goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law.\"[142][143]\nUpon taking office, Barr refused calls to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation, despite his June 2018 memo arguing that the special counsel had no right to investigate Trump.[97][98]\nOn March 22, 2019, Mueller concluded his special counsel investigation and gave the final report to Barr.[144]\nOn March 24, Barr submitted a four-page letter to Congress describing what he said were the report's principal conclusions: first, that the Special Counsel did not establish conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2016 election; and second, that the Special Counsel made no decision as to whether to prosecute Trump for obstruction of justice, quoting \"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\" Barr stated that the Special Counsel's decision \"leaves it to\" Barr to decide if Trump obstructed justice. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein themselves concluded that the evidence \"is not sufficient to establish\" obstruction of justice by Trump, and made the decision not to press the charge.[145][146][147][148][149]\nAccording to federal judge Amy Berman Jackson, the Barr letter which declined to charge Trump, and a Justice Department memo purportedly containing advice to Barr that Trump should not be charged, were \"being written by the very same people at the very same time\". Jackson also stated that email evidence showed that the Barr letter was \"the priority, and it is getting completed first\" ahead of the advice memo.[150][151]\nOn March 25, Mueller reportedly wrote a letter to Barr, as described in The New York Times as \"expressing his and his team's concerns that the attorney general had inadequately portrayed their conclusions\".[152] In USA Today it was described that Mueller \"expressed his differences with Barr\".[153]\nOn March 27, Mueller sent Barr another letter describing his concerns of Barr's letter to Congress and the public on March 24. In it, Mueller complained that the summary \"did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance\" of the Special Counsel's probe, adding, \"There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.\"[154] Both before and after the release of Barr's summary, Mueller repeatedly tried to get Barr to release the report's introductions and executive summaries. Mueller's March 27 letter also stated that he had earlier sent a March 25 letter to Barr.[155]\nMueller's March 27 letter prompted Barr to call Mueller on March 28. Barr clarified on the intention of his letter both in his phone call with Mueller and in another letter to Congress that his letter had not been intended to be a summary of the report, but rather a description of the principal findings of the report.[156][154]\nOn April 9, Barr appeared in a congressional hearing before the House. There, Representative Charlie Crist described media reports that \"members of the special counsel's team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24 letter, that it does not adequately or accurately portray the [Mueller] report's findings.\" Crist asked Barr: \"Do you know what they are referencing with that?\" Barr replied: \"No, I don't.\"[157][158] On April 10, Attorney General Barr appeared before the Senate Appropriations Committee. Senator Chris Van Hollen asked Barr regarding obstruction: \"Did Bob Mueller support your conclusion?\" Barr replied: \"I don't know whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusion.\"[157][158]\nThe Department of Justice released a redacted version of the special counsel's report in the morning of April 18, 2019.[159][160] After the release of the full report, fact-checkers and news outlets characterized Barr's initial letter as a deliberate mischaracterization of the Mueller Report and its conclusions.[161][162][163][164][165][166] The New York Times reported instances in which the Barr letter omitted information and quoted sentence fragments out of context in ways that significantly altered the Mueller findings, including:[161]\n\nA sentence fragment described only one possible motive for Trump to obstruct justice, while the Mueller report listed other possible motives.\nOmission of words and a full sentence that twice suggested there was knowing and complicit behavior between the Trump campaign and Russians that stopped short of coordination\nOmission of language that indicated Trump could be subject to indictment after leaving office, to suggest that Trump was cleared in full\nAccording to the Associated Press, Barr misrepresented the report in several ways, saying the report gave no indication that Congress could make a determination on obstruction of justice (the report specifically stated \"that Congress may apply obstruction laws\") and that \"these reports are not supposed to be made public\" (when DOJ regulations give the AG wide authority in releasing reports such as this one).[167] Barr falsely claimed in his summary of the report that \"the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel's investigation.\"[168] The Washington Post fact-checker described Barr's claim as \"astonishing\"[162] and PolitiFact said it was \"false\".[168] In actuality, Trump declined to grant the Special Counsel an in-person interview, and the Special Counsel report characterized Trump's written responses to interview questions as \"inadequate\".[168] The report also documented numerous instances where Trump tried to either impede or end the Special Counsel investigation, analyzing each in terms of the three factors necessary for a criminal charge of obstruction.[168][169][170][failed verification]\nDuring a press conference, Barr said Mueller's report contained \"substantial evidence\" that Trump was \"frustrated and angered\" because of his belief that the \"investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks\"; however, the report gave no indication that Trump's frustrations with the investigation would mitigate obstructing behavior.[155][171][172] Barr also said it would not be criminal obstruction of justice for a president to instruct a staffer to lie to investigators about the president's actions,[173] and suggested a president could legally terminate an investigation into himself if he was being \"falsely accused\".[174]\nOn May 8, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to hold Barr in contempt of congress for failing to comply with a subpoena which requested the full and unredacted Mueller Report.[175] The matter then fell to the House of Representatives at-large for a contempt of Congress vote.[176] The Justice Department took the position that disclosure of the unredacted Mueller Report would require the department to violate \"the law, court rules and court orders\" as well as grand jury secrecy rules.[175]\nDuring May 1, 2019, testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Barr stated he accepted Mueller's interpretation of the law that was applied in the Report. However, in a May 30 CBS News interview, Barr said he had applied his own interpretation of the law and took the position that obstruction laws cannot apply to presidents who abuse their official powers to impede an investigation for a corrupt reason. Barr elaborated: \"As a matter of law\u00a0... we didn't agree with the legal analysis\u00a0\u2013 a lot of the legal analysis in the report. It did not reflect the views of the department.\"[177][178]\nIn March 2020, Reggie Walton, a federal district judge originally appointed by President George W. Bush, criticized Barr's characterizations of the Mueller report as \"distorted\" and \"misleading\". Walton made his comments while presiding over a lawsuit on whether the Mueller report should be released without redactions. As Walton saw it, Barr's \"lack of candor\" undermined Barr's \"credibility and, in turn, the department's\" arguments before the court. Walton had concerns that Barr may have made a \"calculated attempt to influence public discourse\" in favor of President Trump by establishing \"a one-sided narrative\" about the report contrary to the report's findings. Walton questioned if the report's redactions were actually \"self-serving\" to avoid conflict with Barr's statements, and if the Justice Department used \"post-hoc rationalizations\" to defend Barr. Thus, Walton decided to personally review the redacted material to check if the redactions were justified.[179][180] On September 3, Walton ruled that the redaction of FBI reports of witness interviews was proper.[181] On September 30, he ruled the DOJ had violated federal law by redacting some portions of the Mueller report and ordered them to be released before the November election.[182]\n\nThe March 24, 2019 Office of Legal Counsel memo.\nIn May 2021, federal judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that a March 24, 2019 Department of Justice memo[183] must be published without redactions.[184] Previously in April 2019, Barr said that his decision to not charge Trump was made \"in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel and other department lawyers\". In this lawsuit, the Department of Justice argued that since Barr relied on the advice of this memo to make his decision, this memo should not be published unredacted. Jackson rejected this argument after reviewing the unredacted memo, stating that Barr could not have made the decision on the memo's advice, because the unredacted memo showed that the decision had already been made not to charge Trump. In addition, according to Jackson, the unredacted memo indicated that Barr did not have legitimate authority to make a prosecution decision regarding Trump. Jackson concluded that Barr had been \"disingenuous\" to Congress in 2019, and that the Department of Justice had been \"disingenuous to this court\" regarding their \"decision-making process\".[151][184][185]\n\nSpygate[edit]\nIn April 2019, Barr stated that he thought \"spying did occur\" against the Trump 2016 presidential campaign.[186] The remark echoed unsubstantiated claims made by Trump and his supporters that the Trump campaign had been unfairly targeted or spied on by the FBI; Trump described it as an \"attempted coup\".[187][186][188][189][190] There is no evidence that government officials engaged in \"spying\" on the Trump campaign.[188] Barr later said he was not sure what spying had occurred and he did clarify what he meant by \"spying\".[186] He also said he had no evidence of wrong-doing.[186][189] Democrats criticized Barr's statement as \"incendiary\", saying the statement was intended to please Trump and that the statement lacked credibility following Barr's misrepresentation of the Mueller report in March 2019.[186][188][189] Barr said he thought there was not \"any pejorative connotation at all\" to the term spying.[191] At the time, Barr said he would not launch an investigation into the origins of the FBI probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[188]\nFBI officials denied Barr's claims about spying.[192] FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said he was unaware of any illegal surveillance by the FBI; he rejected the description of \"spying\".[193] Subsequently, Trump retweeted a far-right pundit who said the FBI had \"no leadership\" and that Wray was \"protecting the same gang that tried to overthrow the president in an illegal coup\".[194] Trump said Wray's statement was \"ridiculous\".[194] Former FBI Director James Comey rebutted Barr, saying \"The FBI doesn't spy. The FBI investigates.\"[187]\nIn May 2019, Barr asserted, \"Government power was used to spy on American citizens.\"[191] Barr did not identify the specific actions prior to the 2016 election that he considered spying.[191]\n\nContempt of Congress[edit]\nOn May 1, 2019, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told the House Oversight Committee that Barr had instructed Justice Department official John Gore to refuse a subpoena to testify in front of the committee. The committee subpoenaed Gore over the Trump administration's efforts to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 United States Census. The reason for the refusal was that the committee's decision to not allow a Justice Department lawyer to accompany Gore during testimony violated \"the confidentiality interests of the Executive Branch\" (though a separate room was permitted).[195] In early June the House Oversight Committee moved to hold Barr in contempt of congress for defying a subpoena regarding the efforts to add a citizenship question to the census.[196] In July 2019, the House of Representatives voted 230\u2013198 to hold Barr (and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross) in criminal contempt of Congress, after they failed to produce documents as April 2019 congressional subpoenas mandated. The documents, on the planned (and eventually scrapped) citizenship question in the 2020 census, were withheld due to a \"deliberative process\" and \"attorney-client communications\", according to the Justice Department. President Trump also asserted executive privilege over the documents to withhold them from Congress. Only once prior has a sitting Cabinet member been held in criminal contempt of Congress (Eric Holder in 2012). The House instructed the Justice Department to prosecute Barr, but the Department refused.[197][198]\n\nOrigins of the Russia investigation[edit]\nMain article: Durham special counsel investigation\nTrump\u2013Ukraine scandalA request by U.S. President Donald Trump (right) to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (left) to investigate Joe Biden and his son sparked the scandal.\nEvents\nList\nPresidency of Donald Trump\n2019 Ukrainian presidential election\nImpeachment inquiry against Donald Trump\nFirst impeachment of Donald Trump\nFirst impeachment trial of Donald Trump\n2020 U.S. presidential election\nForeign interference in the 2020 United States elections\n\nPeople\nWhite House\nPresident Donald Trump\nJohn Bolton\nPam Bondi\nTom Bossert\nPat Cipollone\nFiona Hill\nCharles Kupperman\nMick Mulvaney\nMike Pence\nTony Sayegh\n\nJustice Department\nMichael Atkinson\nWilliam Barr\n\nState Department\nUlrich Brechbuhl\nCatherine Croft\nDavid Hale\nDavid Holmes\nGeorge Kent\nSteve Linick\nMichael McKinley\nMike Pompeo\nPhilip Reeker\nGordon Sondland\nBill Taylor\nKurt Volker\nJennifer Williams\nMarie Yovanovitch\n\nDefense Department\nLaura Cooper\nKathryn L.

At Barr's request Trump phoned the prime minister of Australia to request his cooperation.[205][206] Barr sought information related to a conspiracy theory that had circulated among Trump allies in conservative media asserting Joseph Mifsud was a Western intelligence operative who was allegedly directed to entrap Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos in order to establish a false predicate for the FBI to open an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. On October 2, 2019, Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump supporter and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote a letter to the leaders of Britain, Australia and Italy, asserting as fact that both Mifsud and Australian diplomat Alexander Downer had been directed to contact Papadopoulos. Joe Hockey, the Australian ambassador to the United States, sharply rejected Graham's characterization of Downer.[207][208] A former Italian government official told The Washington Post in October 2019 that during a meeting the previous month, Italian intelligence services told Barr they had \"no connections, no activities, no interference\" in the matter; Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte later affirmed this.[209][210] One British official with knowledge of Barr's requests observed, \"it is like nothing we have come across before, they are basically asking, in quite robust terms, for help in doing a hatchet job on their own intelligence services.\"[211] The Washington Post reported on November 22, 2019, that the Justice Department inspector general had aggressively investigated the allegation that Mifsud had been directed to entrap Papadopoulos, but found it was without merit. The Post also reported the inspector general found the opening of the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation was legally and factually predicated.[212] The Post subsequently reported in December 2019 that Barr disagreed with the inspector general's conclusion that there was adequate evidence for the FBI to open its investigation.[213] The Post also reported in December 2019 that the inspector general asked Durham and several American intelligence agencies if there was evidence of a setup by American intelligence, but they replied there was none.[214]\nOn October 24, 2019, two sources told The New York Times that the Durham inquiry had been elevated to a criminal investigation.[215] The Times reported on November 22 that the Justice Department inspector general had made a criminal referral to Durham regarding Kevin Clinesmith, an FBI attorney who had altered an email during the process of acquiring a wiretap warrant renewal on Carter Page, and that referral appeared to be at least part of the reason Durham's investigation was elevated to criminal status.[216] Barr rejected criticism by Democrats in Congress that the transitioned investigation was designed to provide support to Trump during his impeachment inquiry in the Trump-Ukraine scandal.[217][218] On August 14, 2020, Clinesmith pleaded guilty to a felony violation of altering an email used to maintain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, having added the phrase \"not a 'source'\" to the original email.[219][220] Carter Page had a prior operational relationship with the CIA from 2008 to 2013.[221]\nIn November 2019, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz concluded his investigation into the origins of the 2016 Russia probe, concluding that the investigation was not tainted by \"political bias or improper motivation\", and that the initial information gathered \"was sufficient to predicate the investigation\" given the \"low threshold\" for opening an investigation. Barr rejected the conclusions of the report, declaring that the investigation was started \"on the thinnest of suspicions that, in [his] view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken\". This also contradicted FBI director Chris Wray, who interpreted Horowitz's findings as the investigation having \"appropriate predication and authorization\".[222][223]\nIn December 2019, Barr claimed in an interview with NBC News that the Russia investigation was \"completely baseless\" and said he believed the FBI's investigation may have been conducted in \"bad faith\".[224] Barr also refused to refute the debunked conspiracy theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election during the interview.[224][225] In a subsequent interview on Fox News, Barr asserted, \"the president bore the burden of probably one of the greatest conspiracy theories\u00a0\u2013 baseless conspiracy theories\u00a0\u2013 in American political history,\" despite the recent inspector general report debunking several conspiracy theories Trump and his allies had promoted.[226][227][228][229]\nIn January 2020, Barr prohibited the start of counterintelligence investigations related to presidential campaigns unless both the attorney general and head of the FBI signed off on those investigations.[230]\nBarr defended Trump's April 2020 firing of intelligence community inspector general Michael K. Atkinson. Atkinson was the inspector general who sought to get the Trump administration to the disclose the Ukraine scandal whistleblower complaint to Congress. In defense of the firing, Barr allegedly made numerous false claims about Atkinson's actions during his tenure.[231]\nOn May 18, 2020, Barr commented on prior investigations into potential collusion between Trump and Russia stating: \"What happened to the president in the 2016 election and throughout the first two years of his administration was abhorrent\u00a0... it was a grave injustice and it was unprecedented in American history\u00a0... the law enforcement and intelligence apparatus of this country were involved in advancing a false and utterly baseless Russian collusion narrative against this president.\"[5][6]\nBarr hinted in June 2020 that the Durham investigation would produce results regarding the \"complete collapse of the Russiagate scandal\" before the end of the summer.[232] In July he told a Congressional committee that the results of the investigation could be released before the election, despite an informal Justice Department rule limiting release of such information.[233] In August, Trump in public comments appeared to be getting impatient for the investigation to produce more prosecutions and suggesting that his opinion of Barr will be negatively influenced if it does not.[233] As summer ended there were reports that Barr was pressing for the Durham investigation to release its report. Colleagues of Durham have said they believe he is under pressure to produce something before the election. A top aide in the investigation quietly resigned on September 10; she gave no reason, but colleagues said she was concerned about political pressure from Barr.[234] On September 18, 2020, four chairs of Democratic committees asked the DOJ inspector general to open an emergency investigation because \"We are concerned by indications that Attorney General Barr might depart from longstanding DOJ principles to take public action related to U.S. Attorney Durham's investigation that could impact the presidential election,\" adding that Barr's public comments may have already violated that policy.[235]\nOn November 2, 2020, the day before the presidential election, New York magazine reported that:\n\n...\u00a0there has been no evidence found, after 18 months of investigation, to support Barr's claims that Trump was targeted by politically biased Obama officials to prevent his election. (The probe remains ongoing.) In fact, the sources said, the Durham investigation has so far uncovered no evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden or Barack Obama, or that they were even involved with the Russia investigation. There 'was no evidence\u00a0... not even remotely\u00a0... indicating Obama or Biden did anything wrong,' as one person put it.[236]\nIntervention in cases of Trump associates[edit]\nBarr with Joe Grogan (left) and Ivanka Trump (right), in 2020.\nIn the spring of 2019, Barr reportedly attempted to undermine the conviction of Trump fixer Michael Cohen for campaign finance violations, detailed The New York Times in June 2020. Barr reportedly raised doubts multiple times about the validity of the charges against Cohen, including requesting the Office of Legal Counsel to draft a memo with legal arguments which could have helped Cohen's case. Barr's efforts were reportedly stemmed by the prosecutors of the Southern District of New York. Ultimately, Cohen's conviction was not changed.[237]\nIn February 2020, President Trump directly referenced Barr in the Justice Department's intercession in recommending a lighter sentence for Trump's associate and old friend Roger Stone. Trump's tweet stated: \"Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought.\" Initially, four career prosecutors had recommended that Stone serve a jail term of between seven and nine years. A Trump tweet followed: \"Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!\"\u00a0\u2013 after which the department recommended an unspecified jail term. The department claimed that this later decision was made without consulting the White House. The prosecutors resigned from the case as a result, with one choosing to leave the department.[238][239]\nBarr affirmed that he had made the decision in the Stone case to change the sentencing memo. Barr said Trump had not asked him to step in, but noted that Trump's tweets and public comments make it impossible for the attorney general to do his job. \"I think it's time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\" Barr said.[240][241] Barr's rebuke of Trump's use of Twitter for interference in DOJ matters were seen as a rare departure from his usual unwavering support of the president. Barr's comments followed criticism of the department for its poor handling of the sentencing of Roger Stone after DOJ actions seen as favorable to Trump and his allies.[242][243] Days later, a bipartisan group of more than 2,000 former DOJ employees signed a letter calling for Barr's resignation.[244][245] while the Federal Judges Association of over a thousand federal jurists called an emergency meeting for February 18 to discuss their concerns about the intervention of Trump and Justice Department officials in politically sensitive cases.[246] Despite Barr's rebuke of Trump, days later the president resumed denouncing the prosecutors, the judge, and the jury foreperson in the Stone case, while acknowledging that his comments made Barr's job harder.[247] After granting several pardons, Trump also labeled himself as the country's \"chief law enforcement officer\", a description usually reserved for the attorney general.[248]\nAdditionally in February 2020, Barr declared that there would be a review of the criminal case of Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor to Trump, who had pled guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian ambassador. Flynn later attempted to withdraw his guilty plea, and had not been sentenced yet.[249][250] Barr chose St. Louis's chief federal prosecutor, Jeffrey Jensen, to conduct the review. Jensen himself was nominated by Trump for the St. Louis position.[250] Trump had publicly called for the charges to be dropped against Flynn. In late April or early May, Jensen recommended to Barr that the charges be dropped.[251]\nThe Justice Department announced in May 2020 that the charges against Flynn would be dropped, with Jensen stating that Barr had agreed with his recommendation.[251] Shortly after, Barr was asked in a media interview if given that Flynn \"admitted lying to the FBI. Does the fact remain that he lied?\" Barr replied that \"people sometimes plead to things that turn out not to be crimes\u00a0... the Department of Justice is not persuaded that this was material to any legitimate counterintelligence investigation. So it was not a crime.\" Barr denied that he was carrying out the president's agenda on this case, stating that he was \"doing the law's bidding\". He also said that from this case, he wanted to show Americans that \"there's only one standard of justice,\" instead of two standards of justice.[252]\nBetween Trump's election and inauguration, Flynn had phone conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak that were incidentally intercepted by American intelligence in the course of routine surveillance of Russian agents. Among other topics, Flynn discussed sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration for Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Per policy regarding American persons, Flynn's identity was masked before accounts of his conversations were distributed to high-level Obama administration officials. Some officials, notably national security advisor Susan Rice, were so concerned by the accounts that they requested Flynn's identity be unmasked, per procedure. After the unmasking was reported by the press, Trump and his allies insisted it was evidence the Obama administration was spying on him and his associates for political purposes. In May 2020, Barr spokesperson Kerri Kupec announced on the program of Fox News host Sean Hannity that Barr had appointed U.S. attorney John Bash to investigate. She also stated that John Durham, whom Barr had appointed to investigate the origins of the FBI Crossfire Hurricane investigation, had also been examining the unmasking issue. The Bash investigation was quietly closed five months later, with no public announcement or report, reportedly finding nothing improper. Bash's 52-page report, previously classified top secret, was released in May 2022. Bash wrote he had found no evidence that any unmasking requests were made for any political or otherwise improper reasons during the 2016 election period or the ensuing presidential transition.[253][254][255]\nBarr's firing of Geoffrey Berman was widely condemned,[256] \ngiven that the Southern District of New York was actively pursuing criminal investigations into several persons and companies associated with President Donald Trump and The Trump Organization.[257][237]\nBarr's conduct was seen as sacrificing the independence of the Department of Justice to protect Trump and his allies.[258]\nFor these reasons, numerous groups have called for Barr's resignation, including the New York City Bar Association.[259]\n\nEthics complaints[edit]\nOn October 3, 2019, Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. filed ethics complaints against Barr with the District of Columbia Bar and Virginia Bar associations.[260] On February 14, 2020, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed an ethics complaint against Barr with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility and Office of the Inspector General, accusing Barr of \"violating several Justice Department rules, guidelines and procedures\".[261] On July 22, 2020, a group of 27 \"legal ethics experts and former government lawyers\", including four former presidents of the District of Columbia Bar, also filed a complaint against Barr with the District of Columbia Bar.[262][263] A bar association may take years to investigate an ethics complaint filed against a lawyer.[262] If the District of Columbia Bar concludes that a lawyer has violated any of its Rules of Professional Conduct, that lawyer may be sanctioned in one of several ways, including admonition, suspension, and disbarment.[264]\n\nHalkbank Investigation and the firing of Geoffrey Berman[edit]\nIn June 2019, in violation of Department of Justice policy, Barr pressured Berman, then the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, to drop an investigation into close allies of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan involved with the Turkish bank Halkbank.[10] The bank and the individuals in question were alleged to have broken U.S. sanctions on Iran, funnelling billions of dollars to Iran and helping fund its nuclear ambitions.[10] Barr's demand followed a concerted pressure campaign by Erdogan and his close associates, including his son-in-law, Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, and Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, a Trump family friend involved in developing the Trump towers in Turkey;[10] Erdogan himself personally insisted to President Trump that the Halkbank investigation be shut down on at least two occasions, November 1, 2018, at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, and on a telephone call on December 14, 2018.[10] According to former National Security Adviser John Bolton, a first-hand witness of many of the events in question, this sequence of events \"does look like obstruction of justice\".[10]\nIn mid-June 2020, Barr announced that Geoffrey Berman, the court-appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), \"is stepping down\". Berman's office had been investigating both Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Trump's inaugural committee, as well as conducting a wider investigation into Trump's company and his associates after successfully prosecuting Michael Cohen, another personal lawyer of Trump.[265] CNN also reported that Berman had prosecuted Halkbank despite Barr's attempt to try to avoid charges for the Turkish state-owned bank, after Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan requested Trump to help drop the charges.[266][9][267][268] Simultaneously, Barr announced that at his recommendation, Trump had appointed Craig Carpenito as the interim SDNY U.S. Attorney, in a departure from the tradition of a career prosecutor from SDNY taking the interim role. Also concurrently, Barr said that Trump would nominate Jay Clayton for the permanent role of SDNY U.S. Attorney.[266][9] Within a day, Berman said that he actually had \"not resigned, and have no intention of resigning\". Berman also said that he only learned of his supposed departure from Barr's public announcement.[9][267] Barr then informed Berman that Trump had fired Berman at Barr's request. Barr did not give a reason for Berman's firing. As a result of the firing, the deputy SDNY U.S. Attorney, Audrey Strauss, would become the interim SDNY U.S. Attorney. With this, Berman agreed to leave. Meanwhile, the Senate indicated it would not confirm Clayton as the permanent replacement.[268][267]\nIn a late Friday night statement on June 19, 2020, Barr stated that Berman was resigning and being replaced by Jay Clayton, citing Berman's behavior in the Halkbank episode as a primary reason for his removal.[10] Berman learned of this through press reports and declined to resign; the next day, Barr asked Trump to fire Berman, which he promptly did. Berman was replaced by his deputy, Audrey Strauss.[269] In November 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani figured in an SDNY investigation into multiple possible felonies.[270]\n\nGeorge Floyd protests[edit]\nBarr joined Trump on his visit to St. John's Episcopal Church in June 2020.\nIn early June 2020, according to reporting by The Washington Post and Fox News, Barr personally ordered that the streets around Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C. should be cleared so that Trump, Barr and other administration officials could stage a photo op in front of St. John's Church. At the time, the streets were occupied by peaceful protesters as part of the George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C.; Barr's order resulted in federal law enforcement officers rushing protesters, and employing smoke canisters, pepper balls, riot shields, and batons against the protesters.[8][271] Barr reacted to the incident by falsely claiming that pepper balls (used by law enforcement on protesters) were not chemical irritants (pepper balls contain pelargonic acid vanillylamide, a chemical irritant; while the product's manufacturer, and the Justice Department, both consider pepper balls a chemical irritant).[272] On August 4, 2020, Barr and presidential adviser Ivanka Trump, and special advisor Heather Fischer announced the $35 million in grant awards to support victims of human trafficking at a White House event. During the roundtable, Barr became emotional and partly covered his face with his hand as survivors of human trafficking told their stories.[273] In August 2020, he invoked qualified immunity before a federal court to protect himself from liability in a lawsuit regarding the Lafayette Square incident.[274] A report by the U.S. Department of the Interior Office of Inspector General (OIG), released in June 2021, concluded that the clearing of the park by the Park Police and other forces was part of a plan to install \"antiscale fencing\" and had not been done so that Trump could stage\u00a0a photo op in front of St. John's Church.[275] The OIG report stated that OIG \"cannot assess whether\" Barr's visit to the park or any planned movement by Trump \"influenced the Secret Service's actions, including its early deployment on to H Street.\"[276]\nIn an August 2020 appearance on Fox News, Barr asserted that Black Lives Matter is \"a revolutionary group that is interested in some form of socialism, communism. They're essentially Bolsheviks. Their tactics are fascistic.\" Barr equated the movement with antifa, characterizing that loose collective as \"highly organized\" and claiming \"the media doesn't take footage of what's happening\" at George Floyd protests. He also claimed that liberals are intent on \"tearing down the system\" and that the Democratic party was only \"interested in total victory. It's a secular religion. It's a substitute for a religion.\"[277] Barr had in June 2020 blamed antifa for orchestrating the George Floyd protests, but analysis by The New York Times found that no one arrested for serious federal crimes at the protests had been linked to antifa.[278] Homeland Security Department secretary Chad Wolf said in September 2020 that he and Barr had discussed arresting leaders of antifa and the Black Lives Matter movement.[279] The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2020 that Barr told federal prosecutors to consider charging violent protestors with plotting to overthrow the US government.[280][281]\nIn an August 2020 interview, Trump claimed that a plane full of \"thugs in dark uniforms\", implying antifa, had recently flown from one unidentified city to another with the intention of fomenting riots. His claim appeared to be based on months-old social media rumors.[282][283] Two days later, Barr asserted he knew that antifa activists \"are flying around the country\" and \"we are following them\".[284] Despite assertions of the threat posed by antifa from Trump, Barr and others, the Department of Homeland Security reported in October 2020 that white supremacists posed the top domestic terrorism threat, which FBI director Christopher Wray confirmed in March 2021, noting the bureau had elevated the threat to the same level as ISIS.[285] The DHS report did not mention antifa.[279][286][287]\nOn September 3, 2020, Trump ordered Barr to identify \"anarchist jurisdictions\", stating in a memorandum, \"It is imperative that the federal government review the use of federal funds by jurisdictions that permit anarchy, violence, and destruction in America's cities.\"[288] Days later, Barr designated New York City, Seattle and Portland, Oregon as such jurisdictions, suggesting they should lose their federal funding because, \"We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance.\"[289] Barr redirected federal homeland security and law enforcement resources to dealing with antifa, whereas the career law enforcement officials had long since concluded that the major domestic terrorism threat came from the far right.[290]\n\n2020 presidential election[edit]\nSee also: Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election\nAs Attorney General, Barr sowed doubt about the integrity of the 2020 election.[291] In a September 2020 interview, Barr falsely asserted the Justice Department had indicted a Texas man for fraudulently completing 1,700 mail-in ballots. There was no such indictment, and the matter actually involved a series of errors by election officials during a county election, rather than fraud.[292][293][294] Barr also repeated a claim that foreign adversaries could flood the country with counterfeit ballots to disrupt the election, a threat that experts characterized as nearly impossible to execute.[295][296] Senior American intelligence officials have said there was no evidence any foreign powers intended to manipulate mail-in voting.[297] The day after Barr's interview, the Department of Homeland Security issued an intelligence bulletin warning that Russia is using social media and other venues to promote false claims that mail voting will lead to widespread fraud, in order \"to undermine public trust in the electoral process\".[298] In a subsequent September 2020 interview, Barr stated that mail-in voting meant \"we're back in the business of selling and buying votes\" including \"outright coercion, paying off a postman, here's a few hundred dollars, give me some of your ballots\".[299] On October 1, 2020, more than 1,600 former DOJ attorneys signed an open letter stating, \"we fear that Attorney General Barr intends to use the DOJ's vast law enforcement powers to undermine our most fundamental democratic value: free and fair elections.\"[300]\nIn September 2020, Barr asserted liberals were \"projecting\", referring to \"all this bullshit about how the president is going to stay in office and seize power? I've never heard of any of that crap. I mean, I'm the attorney general. I would think I would have heard about it.\" During both the 2016 and 2020 campaigns, Trump was noncommittal when asked if he would accept election results showing he had lost. Days after Barr's remarks, Trump was asked if he would commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost the 2020 election, to which he replied, \"Well, we'll have to see what happens. You know that I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster. Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful\u00a0\u2013 there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.\"[301][302][299][303] In the days after his electoral defeat, Trump and his legal team led by Rudy Giuliani pursued an aggressive effort to overturn the results with dozens of lawsuits and numerous false and unsubstantiated assertions revolving around an international communist conspiracy, rigged voting machines and polling place fraud to claim the election had been stolen from Trump.[304][305][306][307][308]\nAfter Joe Biden won the 2020 election and Trump refused to concede, baseless claims of voting fraud circulated.[309] Barr sent a memo to DOJ prosecutors authorizing them to investigate \"vote tabulation irregularities\" before voting results had been certified, a reversal of long-standing department policy. Richard Pilger, director of the Election Crimes Branch at the DOJ Criminal Division, stepped down from that position in protest hours later.[310] Four days later, sixteen assistant U.S. attorneys of the Branch wrote Barr a letter urging him to rescind the memo because it \"thrusts career prosecutors into partisan politics\".[311] Barr later told a journalist that he had always expected Trump's electoral loss and never expected that Trump's fraud claims would have merit: \"My suspicion all the way along was that there was nothing there. It was all bullshit.\" However, he asserted that because he  expected Trump to ask him for details, he informally investigated to educate himself.[312] Some asserted Barr's statements during the campaign suggested otherwise and that he was now attempting to rehabilitate his reputation.[313][314][315] Barr waited until December 1, 2020, to state that the Justice Department \"has not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election\".[11] Trump was angered by the announcement and the fact that Durham had not released any findings prior to the election.[316] Trump was also angered by news that Barr had followed Justice Department policy by not disclosing during the campaign that Joe Biden's son Hunter had since 2018 been under criminal investigation, initially on suspicion of money laundering but later for tax matters.[316][317][318] On December 14, 2020, Trump announced on Twitter that Barr was stepping down from his post on December 23.[319] After a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol after being incited by Trump, Barr said Trump had committed a \"betrayal of his office\".[320]\n\nResignation[edit]\nOn December 14, 2020, Trump announced via Twitter that Barr would be resigning from his post as attorney general, effective December 23.[321] Barr further confirmed his resignation in a letter to Trump on the same day.[322] In summarizing his tenure, Katie Benner of The New York Times wrote that \"Barr brought the Justice Department closer to the White House than any attorney general in a half-century\u00a0... Barr made decisions that dovetailed precisely with Mr. Trump\u2019s wishes and the demands of his political allies.\"[323] CNN summarized his tenure similarly, \"Barr repeatedly and unapologetically prioritized Trump's political goals while furthering his own vision of expansive presidential power.\"[324] Ryan Lucas of NPR described Barr as \"one of Trump's most loyal and effective defenders\".[325] As examples of Barr's actions on behalf of Trump, these critics pointed to the fact that Barr made frequent false claims about the integrity of mail-in voting leading up to the 2020 election, misleadingly summarized Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election,[324][325] harshly criticized those who had investigated Trump,[324] meddled in criminal prosecutions of Trump allies,[326] and ordered the use of force on peaceful protestors across the street from the White House during the George Floyd protests so that President Trump could have a photo op at nearby St. John's Church.\"[324][325]\n\nPost-DOJ career[edit]\nIn 2022, it was reported that Barr would launch a law and consulting firm with former Facebook general counsel Ted Ullyot.[327]\n\nComments on failed Sussmann prosecution[edit]\nOn June 1, 2022, Barr was interviewed on Fox News about the verdict in the failed prosecution of Michael Sussman. He continued to defend Trump by repeating debunked \"Russiagate\" conspiracy theories about the origins of the Russia investigation by stating that the case against Sussmann \"crystallized the central role played by the Hillary campaign in launching, as a dirty trick, the whole Russiagate collusion narrative.\" The Washington Post noted that the Justice Department traditionally seeks to avoid impugning individuals who are not charged with crimes, and the DOJ is not involved in exposing political \"dirty tricks\" that have not been found unlawful. Barr also asserted Durham \"exposed really dreadful behavior by the supervisors in the FBI, the senior ranks of the FBI, who knowingly use this information to start an investigation of Trump,\" though the Sussmann case did not relate to how the FBI Crossfire Hurricane investigation began. Although Barr appointed Durham to investigate possible FBI wrongdoing in opening Crossfire Hurricane, Durham's prosecution of Sussmann portrayed the FBI as a victim, rather than a perpetrator, of wrongdoing.[328][329][330]\n\nJanuary 6 committee testimony[edit]\nBarr testified to the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack behind closed doors on June 2, 2022. Portions of his videotaped testimony were presented during the committee's public hearings days later. Barr testified that before resigning as attorney general, he had told president Trump that allegations of election fraud were \"bullshit.\" At times during his testimony he could not control his laughter at the absurdity of some fraud allegations, such as the Italygate theory that satellites controlled from Italy had flipped votes from Trump to Biden, and that former Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez had orchestrated an election fraud scheme, despite having died seven years earlier. Barr testified Trump never gave \"an indication of interest in what the actual facts were,\" adding the president had \"become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff.\"[331][332]\n\nInvestigation into Trump's handling of presidential documents[edit]\nMain article: FBI investigation into Donald Trump's handling of presidential documents\nBarr has supported the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago and its investigation into the handling of presidential documents by Trump after his presidency, and dismissed Trump's calls for a special master to be appointed.[333]\n\nCriticism[edit]\nThis article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section may compromise the article's neutrality. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. (December 2020)\nOn December 11, 2019, former Attorney General Eric Holder, who had served under President Obama, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post claiming William Barr is \"unfit to be attorney general\"[334] for his \"naked partisan[ship]\", \"attempts to vilify the president's critics\", his attacks on the inspector general and his comments on ongoing investigations.[334]\nIn a December 2019 opinion piece, former FBI director, CIA director and federal judge William Webster wrote of \"a dire threat to the rule of law in the country I love\". Webster asserted that \"the integrity of the institutions that protect our civil order are, tragically, under assault,\" writing that \"aspersions cast upon [FBI employees] by the president and my longtime friend, Attorney General William P. Barr, are troubling in the extreme.\"[335][336] Since 2005, Webster had served as the chair of the Homeland Security Advisory Council.\nSixty-five law professors and faculty from George Washington University Law School, Barr's alma mater, wrote in a June 2020 letter that he had \"failed to fulfill his oath of office to 'support and defend the Constitution of the United States'\". They wrote that Barr's actions as attorney general \"have undermined the rule of law, breached constitutional norms, and damaged the integrity and traditional independence of his office and of the Department of Justice\".[337]\nDuring a June 2020 House Judiciary Committee testimony, Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general for whom Barr worked during the George H. W. Bush presidency, asserted that Barr \"poses the greatest threat, in my lifetime, to our rule of law and to public trust in it\".[338] Three months later, Ayer claimed Barr \"is on a mission to install the president as an autocrat\".[339]\nIn January 2022, it is reported that the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack held conversations with Barr about the Trump administration's approach to compromise the integrity of the 2020 election, specifically about the potential coordination between the Justice Department and the Defense Department.[340]\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nBarr with Senator Mitt Romney in February 2019\nA lifelong Republican, Barr takes an expansive view of executive powers and supports \"law and order\" policies.[341] Considered an establishment Republican at the time of his confirmation, Barr gained a reputation as someone loyal to Trump and his policies during his second tenure as attorney general.[341] His efforts to support the sitting president politically during his DOJ office tenure have been viewed as the most strenuous since those of another law-and-order Attorney General, John N. Mitchell.[342]\n\nImmigration[edit]\nAs Deputy Attorney General, Barr\u00a0\u2013 together with others at the Department of Justice\u00a0\u2013 successfully led the effort for the withdrawal of a proposed Department of Health and Human Services rule that would have allowed people with HIV/AIDS into the United States.[343] He also advocated the use of Guantanamo Bay to prevent Haitian refugees and HIV infected individuals from claiming asylum in the United States.[70] According to Vox in December 2018, Barr supported an aggressive \"law and order\" agenda on immigration as attorney general in the Bush Administration.[344]\n\nDeath penalty[edit]\nBarr supports the death penalty, arguing that it reduces crime. He advocated a Bush-backed bill that would have expanded the types of crime that could be punished by execution. In a 1991 op-ed in The New York Times, Barr argued that death row inmates' ability to challenge their sentences should be limited to avoid cases dragging on for years: \"This lack of finality devastates the criminal justice system. It diminishes the deterrent effect of state criminal laws, saps state prosecutorial resources and continually reopens the wounds of victims and survivors.\"[345][346]\nOn July 25, 2019, Barr announced that the United States federal government would resume its use of capital punishment under his leadership, after nearly two decades without an execution. Barr ordered the Department of Justice to adopt a new lethal injection protocol, consisting of a single drug (pentobarbital), and ordered execution dates to be set for five inmates in December 2019 and January 2020.[347] On July 14, 2020, Daniel Lewis Lee became the first death row inmate executed by the federal government since 2003.[348] Twelve more individuals were executed by the Trump administration.[349] No administration in 120 years had overseen as many executions.[349] Barr has been attributed as playing a key role in the administration's use of execution in prisons.[350]\n\nSocial issues[edit]\nAbortion[edit]\nIn 1991, Barr said he believed the framers of the Constitution did not originally intend to create a right to abortion, that Roe v. Wade was thus wrongly decided, and that abortion should be a \"legitimate issue for state legislators\".[37] However, Barr said during his 1991 confirmation hearings that Roe was \"the law of the land\" and that he did not have \"fixed or settled views\" on the subject.[38]\nAfter Roe was overturned, Barr suggested that a special counsel may be necessary to investigate the leak of the ruling and that the leaker may face criminal charges.[351][352]\n\nDrug policy[edit]\nBarr supports a federal ban on marijuana.[353] However, he has stated that the discrepancy between federal and state law is suboptimal, and that if a uniform federal ban on marijuana could not be achieved, then he would support the STATES Act on marijuana legalization.[353] \"I think it's a mistake to back off on marijuana\u00a0... However, if we want a federal approach, if we want states to have their own laws, then let's get there and let's get there the right way.\" Barr also said DOJ policy should align with congressional legislation.[354]\n\n2016 election[edit]\nBarr donated $55,000 to a political action committee that backed Jeb Bush during the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries and $2,700 to Donald Trump during the general election campaign.[355]\n\nExecutive powers[edit]\nBarr is a proponent of the unitary executive theory, which holds that the President has broad executive powers.[3][291][356][357][358] Prior to joining the Trump administration, he argued that the president has \"complete authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding\".[3]\n\nRace relations[edit]\nIn June 2020, amid the George Floyd protests against racism and police brutality, Barr said he rejected the view \"that the law enforcement system is systemically racist\".[359] In a CNN news interview in September 2020, Barr denied that systemic racism plays a role in police shootings of unarmed African American men and called such shootings by white police officers \"very rare\".[360] Derek Chauvin, the officer who murdered Floyd, was willing to agree to third-degree murder and serve more than ten years in prison. Barr rejected a plea deal.[361]\nIn September 2020, Barr suggested bringing sedition charges against disruptive looters and rioters, a legal tool that is rarely used by the United States government.[362] Sedition charges are normally reserved for those who \"conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States\", according to (18\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02384). Such suggestions have brought fears that Barr is politicizing the U.S. Justice Department and, if enacted, would mean that the Justice Department could prosecute individuals based on political speech.[363]\n\nChina[edit]\nIn July 2020, Barr condemned large American tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple,[364] and Hollywood studios, accusing them of \"kowtowing\" to the Chinese Communist Party for the sake of profits. He said that \"Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights.\"[365]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBarr has been married to Christine Moynihan Barr since 1973.[16] She holds a master's degree in library science, and together they have three daughters:[366] Mary Barr Daly, Patricia Barr Straughn,[367] and Margaret (Meg) Barr.[14] Their eldest daughter, Mary, born 1977 or 1978, was a senior Justice Department official who oversaw the department's anti-opioid and addiction efforts; Patricia, born 1981 or 1982, was counsel for the House Agriculture Committee; and Meg, born 1984 or 1985, is a former Washington prosecutor and cancer survivor (of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma), was counsel for Republican Senator Mike Braun of Indiana.[14]\nIn February 2019, as their father awaited Senate confirmation for his appointment as attorney general, Mary left her post at the Department of Justice as the Trump Administration's point woman on the opioid crisis and took a position at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Treasury Department's financial crimes unit.[368] Her husband, however, continued to work in the Justice Department's National Security Division.[369] Around the same time Mary left the Department of Justice, Tyler McGaughey, the husband of her youngest sister, left the U.S. Attorney's office in Alexandria, Virginia, to join the White House Counsel's office.[368]\nBarr is a Roman Catholic and is a member of the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast. Barr served from 2014 to 2017 on the board of the Catholic Information Center (CIC) of the Archdiocese of Washington, an Opus Dei center and nexus of politically connected Catholics on K Street.[80] Opus Dei has denied that Barr is a member.[370]\nHowever, his views in favor of the death penalty were criticised by the Jesuit magazine America.[371][372]\nBarr is an avid bagpiper. He began playing at age eight and has performed competitively in Scotland with a major American pipe band. At one time, Barr was a member of the City of Washington Pipe Band.[43] During a US Attorneys\u2019 National Conference on June 26, 2019, Barr surprised attendees by standing up in the middle of an NYPD Emerald Society performance, and joined them in playing Scotland the Brave with a bagpipe.[373]\nBarr is the brother of Stephen Barr, a physics professor at the University of Delaware.[15]\nBarr and Robert Mueller have known each other since the 1980s and are said to be good friends. Mueller attended the weddings of two of Barr's daughters, and their wives attend Bible study together.[374]\n\nHonors[edit]\nIn 1992, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D) by George Washington University.[375]\n\nBibliography[edit]\n\u2014 (2022).

Bennett (brother)Children2EducationWilliams College (BA)University of Texas at Austin (MA, PhD)Harvard University (JD)\nWilliam John Bennett (born July 31, 1943) is an American conservative politician and political commentator who served as secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 under President Ronald Reagan. He also held the post of director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under George H. W. Bush.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBennett was born July 31, 1943[1] to a Catholic family in Brooklyn, the son of Nancy (n\u00e9e Walsh), a medical secretary, and F. Robert Bennett, a banker.[2][3] His family moved to Washington, D.C., where he attended Gonzaga College High School. He graduated from Williams College in 1965, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Society, and received a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin in political philosophy in 1970. He also has a J.D. from Harvard Law School, graduating in 1971.\n\nCareer[edit]\nEducational institutions[edit]\nBennett was an associate dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Boston University from 1971 to 1972 and then became an assistant professor of philosophy and an assistant to John Silber, the president of the college, from 1972 to 1976. In May 1979, Bennett became the director of the National Humanities Center, an independent institute in North Carolina, after the death of its founder Charles Frankel.\n\nFederal offices[edit]\nBennett as Secretary of Education in 1985\nIn 1981 President Reagan appointed Bennett to chair the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), where he served until Reagan appointed him Secretary of Education in 1985. Reagan initially nominated Mel Bradford to the position, but due to Bradford's pro-Confederate views, Bennett was appointed. This event was later marked as the watershed in the divergence between paleoconservatives, who backed Bradford, and neoconservatives, led by Irving Kristol, who supported Bennett.\nWhile at NEH, Bennett published \"To Reclaim a Legacy: A Report on the Humanities in Higher Education\", a 63-page report. It was based on an assessment of the teaching and learning of the humanities at the baccalaureate level, conducted by a blue-ribbon study group of 31 nationally prominent authorities on higher education convened by NEH.[4]\nIn May 1986, Bennett switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party.[5] In September 1988, Bennett resigned as secretary of education, to join the Washington law firm of Dunnels, Duvall, Bennett, and Porter. In March 1989, he returned to the federal government, becoming the first Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, appointed by President George H. W. Bush. He was confirmed by the Senate in a 97\u20132 vote. He left that position in December 1990.\n\nRadio and television[edit]\nIn April 2004, Bennett began hosting Morning in America, a nationally syndicated radio program produced and distributed by Dallas, Texas-based Salem Communications.[6] The show aired live weekdays from 6:00 to 9:00\u00a0a.m. Eastern Time, and was one of the only syndicated conservative talk shows in the morning drive time slot. However, its clearances were limited due to a preference for local shows in this slot,[clarify] and the show got most of its clearances on Salem-owned outlets. Morning in America was also carried on Sirius Satellite Radio, on Channel 144, also known as the Patriot Channel.[7] Bennett retired from full-time radio on March 31, 2016.[8][9]\nIn 2008, Bennett became the host of a CNN weekly talk show, Beyond the Politics. The show did not have a long run, but Bennett remained a CNN contributor until he was fired in 2013 by then-new CNN president Jeff Zucker.\nBennett has been moderating The Wise Guys, a Sunday night show on Fox News, since January 2018. Carried on Fox Nation as well, participants include Tyrus, Byron York, Ari Fleischer, Victor Davis Hanson, and others.[10]\n\nAuthor, speaker, and pundit[edit]\nBennett writes for National Review Online, National Review and Commentary, and is a former senior editor of National Review.\nBennett is a member of the National Security Advisory Council of the Center for Security Policy (CSP). He was co-director of Empower America and was a Distinguished Fellow in Cultural Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation. Long active in United States Republican Party politics, he is now an author and speaker.\nBennett was the Washington Fellow of the Claremont Institute. He was also a commentator for CNN until 2013.\nHe is an advisor to Project Lead The Way and Beanstalk Innovation.[11] He is on the advisory board of Udacity, Inc., Viridis Learning, Inc. and the board of directors of Vocefy, Inc. and Webtab, Inc.\nIn 2017, Bennett launched a podcast, The Bill Bennett Show.[12]\nAccording to internal White House records from January 6, 2021, Bennett spoke on the phone with then-President Donald Trump just before Trump went to the \"Save America\" rally that preceded the attack on the Capitol.[13]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nBennett with President Ronald Reagan at the White House in 1987\nBennett tends to take a conservative position on affirmative action, school vouchers, curriculum reform, and religion in education. As education secretary, he asked colleges for stronger enforcement of drug laws and supported a classical education. He frequently criticized schools for low standards. In 1987 he called the Chicago Public Schools system \"the worst in the nation.\"[14] He coined the term \"the blob\" to describe the state education bureaucracy,[15] a derogation which was later taken up in Britain by Michael Gove.[16]\nBennett is a staunch supporter of the War on Drugs and has been criticized by some for his views. On Larry King Live, he said that a viewer's suggestion of beheading drug dealers would be \"morally plausible.\"[17] He also \"lamented that we still grant them [drug dealers] habeas corpus rights.\"[18]\nBennett is a member of the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) and was one of the signers of the January 26, 1998 PNAC Letter[19] sent to President Bill Clinton, which urged Clinton to remove Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein from power.\nBennett is a neoconservative, and [20] was an advocate for the Iraq War.[20]\nIn 2016, Bennett vigorously supported Donald Trump in his presidential campaign, writing that saying that conservatives who objected to Trump \"suffer from a terrible case of moral superiority and put their own vanity and taste above the interest of the country\" and that \"our country can survive the occasional infelicities and improprieties of Donald Trump. But it cannot survive losing the Supreme Court to liberals.\"[21]\n\nControversies[edit]\nGambling[edit]\nIn 2003, it became publicly known that Bennett - who had spent years preaching about family values and personal responsibility - was a high-stakes gambler who lost millions of dollars in Las Vegas.[22] Criticism increased in the wake of Bennett's publication, The Book of Virtues, a compilation of moral stories about courage, responsibility, friendship and other examples of virtue. Joshua Green of the Washington Monthly said that Bennett failed to denounce gambling because of his own tendency to gamble. Also, Bennett and Empower America, the organization he co-founded and headed at the time, opposed an extension of casino gambling in the United States.[23]\nBennett said that his habit had not jeopardized himself or his family financially. After Bennett's gambling problem became public, he said he did not believe his habit set a good example, that he had \"done too much gambling\" over the years, and his \"gambling days are over\". \"We are financially solvent,\" his wife Elayne told USA Today. \"All our bills are paid.\" She added that his gambling days are over. \"He's never going again,\" she said.[24]\nSeveral months later, Bennett qualified his position, saying, \"So, in this case, the excessive gambling is over.\" He explained, \"Since there will be people doing the micrometer on me, I just want to be clear: I do want to be able to bet the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl.\"[25]\n\nRadio show abortion comment[edit]\nOn September 28, 2005, in a discussion on Bennett's Morning in America radio show, a caller to the show proposed that \"lost revenue from the people who have been aborted in the last 30 years\" could preserve Social Security if abortion had not been permitted since Roe v. Wade. Bennett responded by hypothesizing, \"If you wanted to reduce crime, you could\u2014if that were the sole purpose\u2014you could abort every black baby in this country and the crime rate would go down. That would be an impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down.\"[26][27]\nBennett responded to the criticism by saying, in part:\n\nA thought experiment about public policy, on national radio, should not have received the condemnations it has. Anyone paying attention to this debate should be offended by those who have selectively quoted me, distorted my meaning, and taken out of context the dialogue I engaged in this week. Such distortions from 'leaders' of organizations and parties is a disgrace not only to the organizations and institutions they serve, but to the First Amendment.[28]\nBooks[edit]\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Bennett on The Book of Virtues, January 9, 1994, C-SPAN\nBennett's best-known written work may be The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral Stories (1993), which he edited; he has also authored and edited eleven other books, including The Children's Book of Virtues (which inspired an animated television series) and The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (1998).\nOther books:\n\nFirst Lessons.

He later lamented, \"That date lasted two hours, and I've spent 200 hours talking about it.\"[29]\nBennett married his wife, Mary Elayne Glover, in 1982. They have two sons, John and Joseph. Elayne is the president and founder of Best Friends Foundation, a national program promoting sexual abstinence among adolescents.\nBennett is the younger brother of Washington attorney Robert S.
