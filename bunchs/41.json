\u02c8\u0292i\u0292\u025bk];[needs tone marked IPA] born 21 March 1949) is a Slovenian philosopher, cultural theorist and public intellectual.[4][5] He is international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London, visiting professor at New York University and a senior researcher at the University of Ljubljana's Department of Philosophy.[6] He primarily works on continental philosophy (particularly Hegelianism, psychoanalysis and Marxism) and political theory, as well as film criticism and theology.\n\u017di\u017eek is the most famous associate of the Ljubljana School of Psychoanalysis, a group of Slovenian academics working on German idealism, Lacanian psychoanalysis, ideology critique, and media criticism. His breakthrough work was 1989's The Sublime Object of Ideology, his first book in English, which was decisive in the introduction of the Ljubljana School's thought to English-speaking audiences. He has written over 50 books in multiple languages and speaks Slovene, Serbo-Croatian,[7] English, German,[8] and French.[9] The idiosyncratic style of his public appearances, frequent magazine op-eds, and academic works, characterised by the use of obscene jokes and pop cultural examples, as well as politically incorrect provocations, have gained him fame, controversy and criticism both in and outside academia.[10]\nIn 2012, Foreign Policy listed \u017di\u017eek on its list of Top 100 Global Thinkers, calling him \"a celebrity philosopher\",[11] while elsewhere he has been dubbed the \"Elvis of cultural theory\"[12] and \"the most dangerous philosopher in the West\".[13] \u017di\u017eek has been called \"the leading Hegelian of our time\",[14] and \"the foremost exponent of Lacanian theory\".[15] A journal, the International Journal of \u017di\u017eek Studies, was founded by professors David J. Gunkel and Paul A. Taylor to engage with his work.[16]\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\nEarly life[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek was born in Ljubljana, PR Slovenia, Yugoslavia, into a middle-class family.[17] His father Jo\u017ee \u017di\u017eek was an economist and civil servant from the region of Prekmurje in eastern Slovenia. His mother Vesna, a native of the Gorizia Hills in the Slovenian Littoral, was an accountant in a state enterprise. His parents were atheists.[18] He spent most of his childhood in the coastal town of Portoro\u017e, where he was exposed to Western film, theory and popular culture.[3][19] When \u017di\u017eek was a teenager his family moved back to Ljubljana where he attended Be\u017eigrad High School.[19] Originally wanting to become a filmmaker himself, he abandoned these ambitions and chose to pursue philosophy instead.[20]\n\nEducation[edit]\nIn 1967, during an era of liberalization in Titoist Yugoslavia, \u017di\u017eek enrolled at the University of Ljubljana and studied philosophy and sociology.[21]\n\u017di\u017eek had already begun reading French structuralists prior to entering university, and in 1967 he published the first translation of a text by Jacques Derrida into Slovenian.[22] \u017di\u017eek frequented the circles of dissident intellectuals, including the Heideggerian philosophers Tine Hribar and Ivo Urban\u010di\u010d,[22] and published articles in alternative magazines, such as Praxis, Tribuna and Problemi, which he also edited.[19] In 1971 he accepted a job as an assistant researcher with the promise of tenure, but was dismissed after his Master's thesis was denounced by the authorities as being \"non-Marxist\".[23] He graduated from the University of Ljubljana in 1981 with a Doctor of Arts in Philosophy for his dissertation entitled The Theoretical and Practical Relevance of French Structuralism.[21] He spent the next few years in what was described as \"professional wilderness\", also fulfilling his legal duty of undertaking a year-long national service in the Yugoslav People's Army in Karlovac.[21]\n\nAcademic career[edit]\nDuring the 1980s, \u017di\u017eek edited and translated Jacques Lacan, Sigmund Freud, and Louis Althusser.[24] He used Lacan's work to interpret Hegelian and Marxist philosophy.[citation needed]\nIn 1986, \u017di\u017eek completed a second doctorate (Doctor of Philosophy in psychoanalysis) at the University of Paris VIII under Jacques-Alain Miller, entitled \"La philosophie entre le sympt\u00f4me et le fantasme\".[25]\n\u017di\u017eek wrote the introduction to Slovene translations of G. K. Chesterton's and John Le Carr\u00e9's detective novels.[26]\nIn 1988, he published his first book dedicated entirely to film theory, Pogled s strani.[27] The following year, he achieved international recognition as a social theorist with the 1989 publication of his first book in English, The Sublime Object of Ideology.[28][3]\n\u017di\u017eek has been publishing in journals such as Lacanian Ink and In These Times in the United States, the New Left Review and The London Review of Books in the United Kingdom, and with the Slovenian left-liberal magazine Mladina and newspapers Dnevnik and Delo. He also cooperates with the Polish leftist magazine Krytyka Polityczna, regional southeast European left-wing journal Novi Plamen, and serves on the editorial board of the psychoanalytical journal Problemi.[29] \u017di\u017eek is a series editor of the Northwestern University Press series Diaeresis that publishes works that \"deal not only with philosophy, but also will intervene at the levels of ideology critique, politics, and art theory\".[30]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nIn the late 1980s, \u017di\u017eek came to public attention as a columnist for the alternative youth magazine Mladina, which was critical of Tito's policies, Yugoslav politics, especially the militarization of society. He was a member of the Communist Party of Slovenia until October 1988, when he quit in protest against the JBTZ trial together with 32 other Slovenian intellectuals.[31] Between 1988 and 1990, he was actively involved in several political and civil society movements which fought for the democratization of Slovenia, most notably the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights.[32] In the first free elections in 1990, he ran as the Liberal Democratic Party's candidate for the former four-person collective presidency of Slovenia.[28]\n\nPublic life[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek speaking in 2011\nIn 2003, \u017di\u017eek wrote text to accompany Bruce Weber's photographs in a catalog for Abercrombie & Fitch. Questioned as to the seemliness of a major intellectual writing ad copy, \u017di\u017eek told The Boston Globe, \"If I were asked to choose between doing things like this to earn money and becoming fully employed as an American academic, kissing ass to get a tenured post, I would with pleasure choose writing for such journals!\"[33]\n\u017di\u017eek and his thought have been the subject of several documentaries. The 1996 Liebe Dein Symptom wie Dich selbst! is a German documentary on him. In the 2004 The Reality of the Virtual, \u017di\u017eek gave a one-hour lecture on his interpretation of Lacan's tripartite thesis of the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real.[34] Zizek! is a 2005 documentary by Astra Taylor on his philosophy. The 2006 The Pervert's Guide to Cinema and 2012 The Pervert's Guide to Ideology also portray \u017di\u017eek's ideas and cultural criticism. Examined Life (2008) features \u017di\u017eek speaking about his conception of ecology at a garbage dump. He was also featured in the 2011 Marx Reloaded, directed by Jason Barker.[35]\nForeign Policy named \u017di\u017eek one of its 2012 Top 100 Global Thinkers \"for giving voice to an era of absurdity\".[11]\nIn 2019, \u017di\u017eek began hosting a mini-series called How to Watch the News with Slavoj \u017di\u017eek on the RT network.[36] In April, \u017di\u017eek debated psychology professor Jordan Peterson at the Sony Centre in Toronto, Canada over happiness under capitalism versus Marxism.[37][38]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek has been married four times and has two adult sons, Tim and Kostja. His second wife was Slovene philosopher and socio-legal theorist Renata Salecl, fellow member of the Ljubljana School of Psychoanalysis.[39] His third wife was Argentinian model and Lacanian scholar Analia Hounie, whom he married in 2005.[40] Currently, he is married to Slovene journalist, author and philosopher, Jela Kre\u010di\u010d.[41]\nIn early 2018, \u017di\u017eek experienced Bell's palsy on the right side of his face. He went on to give several lectures and interviews with this condition; on March 9 of that year, during a lecture on political revolutions in London, he commented on the treatment he had been receiving, and used his paralysis as a metaphor for political idleness.[42][43][44]\nAside from his native Slovene, \u017di\u017eek is a fluent speaker of Serbo-Croatian, French, German and English.[45]\n\nTaste[edit]\nIn the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll, \u017di\u017eek listed his 10 favourite films: 3:10 to Yuma, Dune, The Fountainhead, Hero, Hitman, Nightmare Alley, On Dangerous Ground, Opfergang, The Sound of Music, and We the Living. On this list, he clarified: \"I opted for pure madness: the list contains only 'guilty pleasures'\".[46] In his tour of The Criterion Collection closet, he chose Trouble in Paradise, Sweet Smell of Success, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Murmur of the Heart, The Joke, The Ice Storm, Great Expectations, Roberto Rossellini's History Films, City Lights, a box set of Carl Theodor Dreyer's films, Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n and Antichrist.[47]\nIn an article called \"My Favourite Classics\", \u017di\u017eek states that Arnold Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder is the piece of music he would take to a desert island. He goes on to list other favourites, including Beethoven's Fidelio, Schubert's Winterreise, Mussorgsky's Khovanshchina and Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore. He expresses a particular love for Wagner, particularly Das Rheingold and Parsifal. He ranks Schoenberg over Stravinsky, and insists on Eisler's importance among Schoenberg's followers.[48]\n\u017di\u017eek often lists Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Andrei Platonov as his \"three absolute masters of 20th-century literature\".[49] He ranks/prefers Varlam Shalamov over Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Marina Tsvetaeva and Osip Mandelstam over Anna Akhmatova,[50] Daphne du Maurier over Virginia Woolf, and Samuel Beckett over James Joyce.[49]\n\nThought and positions[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek and his thought have been described by many commentators as \"Hegelo-Lacanian\".[51][52][53][54][55] In his early career, \u017di\u017eek claimed \"a theoretical space moulded by three centres of gravity: Hegelian dialectics, Lacanian psychoanalytic theory, and contemporary criticism of ideology\", designating \"the theory of Jacques Lacan\" as the fundamental element.[56] In 2010, \u017di\u017eek instead claimed that for him Hegel is more fundamental than Lacan\u2014\"Even Lacan is just a tool for me to read Hegel. For me, always it is Hegel, Hegel, Hegel.\"[57]\u2014while in 2019, he claimed that \"For me, in some sense, all of philosophy happened in [the] fifty years\" between Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781) and the death of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1831).[58] Alongside his academic, theoretical works, \u017di\u017eek is a prolific commentator on current affairs and contemporary political debates.\n\nSubjectivity[edit]\nFor \u017di\u017eek, although a subject may take on a symbolic (social) position, it can never be reduced to this attempted symbolisation, since the very \"taking on\" of this position implies a separate 'I', beyond the symbolic, that does the taking on. Yet, under scrutiny, nothing positive can be said about this subject, this 'I', that eludes symbolisation; it cannot be discerned as anything but \"that which cannot be symbolised\". Thus, without the initial, attempted, failed symbolisation, subjectivity cannot present itself. As \u017di\u017eek writes in his first book in English: \"the subject of the signifier is a retroactive effect of the failure of its own representation; that is why the failure of representation is the only way to represent it adequately.\"[59]\n\u017di\u017eek attributes this position on the subject to Hegel, particularly his description of man as \"the night of the world\",[60] and to Lacan, with his description of the barred, split subject, who he sees as developing the Cartesian notion of the cogito.[61] According to \u017di\u017eek, these thinkers, in insisting on the role of the subject, run counter to \"culturalist\" or \"historicist\" positions held by thinkers such as Louis Althusser and Michel Foucault, which posit that \"subjects\" are bound by and reducible to their historical/cultural(/symbolic) context.[62]\n\nPolitical theory[edit]\nIdeology[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek's Lacanian-informed theory of ideology is one of his major contributions to political theory; his first book in English, The Sublime Object of Ideology, and the documentary The Pervert's Guide to Ideology, in which he stars, are among the well-known places in which it is discussed. \u017di\u017eek believes that ideology has been frequently misinterpreted as dualistic and, according to him, this misinterpreted dualism posits that there is a real world of material relations and objects outside of oneself, which is accessible to reason.[63]\nFor \u017di\u017eek, as for Marx, ideology is made up of fictions that structure political life; in Lacan's terms, ideology belongs to the symbolic order. \u017di\u017eek argues that these fictions are primarily maintained at an unconscious level, rather than a conscious one. Since, according to psychoanalytic theory, the unconscious can determine one's actions directly, bypassing one's conscious awareness (as in parapraxes), ideology can be expressed in one's behaviour, regardless of one's conscious beliefs. Hence, \u017di\u017eek breaks with orthodox Marxist accounts that view ideology purely as a system of mistaken beliefs (see False consciousness). Drawing on Peter Sloterdijk's Critique of Cynical Reason, \u017di\u017eek argues that adopting a cynical perspective is not enough to escape ideology, since, according to \u017di\u017eek, even though postmodern subjects are consciously cynical about the political situation, they continue to reinforce it through their behaviour.[64]\n\nFreedom[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek claims that (a sense of) political freedom is sustained by a deeper unfreedom, at least under liberal capitalism. In a 2002 article, \u017di\u017eek endorses Lenin's distinction between formal and actual freedom, claiming that liberal society only contains formal freedom, \"freedom of choice within the coordinates of the existing power relations\", while prohibiting actual freedom, \"the site of an intervention that undermines these very coordinates.\"[65] In an oft-quoted passage from a book published in the same year, he writes that, in these conditions of liberal censorship, \"we 'feel free' because we lack the very language to articulate our unfreedom\".[66] In a 2019 article, he writes that Marx \"made a valuable point with his claim that the market economy combines in a unique way political and personal freedom with social unfreedom: personal freedom (freely selling myself on the market) is the very form of my unfreedom.\"[67] However, in 2014, he rejects the \"pseudo-Marxist\" total derision of 'formal freedom', claiming that it is necessary for critique: \"When we are formally free, only then we become aware how limited this freedom actually is.\"[49]\n\u017di\u017eek co-signed a petition condemning the \"use of disproportionate force and retaliatory brutality by the Hong Kong Police against students in university campuses in Hong Kong\" during the 2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests. The petition concludes with the statement: \"We believe the defence of academic freedom, the freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and association, and the responsibility to protect the safety of our students are universal causes common to all.\"[68]\n\nTheology[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek has asserted that \"Atheism is a legacy worth fighting for\" in The New York Times.[69] However, he nonetheless finds extensive conceptual value in Christianity, particularly Protestantism: the subtitle of his 2000 book The Fragile Absolute is \"Or, Why Is the Christian Legacy Worth Fighting For?\". Hence, he labels his position 'Christian Atheism',[70] and has written about theology at length.[71]\nIn The Pervert's Guide to Ideology, \u017di\u017eek suggests that \"the only way to be an Atheist is through Christianity\", since, he claims, atheism often fails to escape the religious paradigm by remaining faithful to an external guarantor of meaning, simply switching God for natural necessity or evolution. Christianity, on the other hand, in the doctrine of the incarnation, brings God down from the 'beyond' and onto earth, into human affairs; for \u017di\u017eek, this paradigm is more authentically godless, since the external guarantee is abolished.[72]\n\nCommunism[edit]\nAlthough sometimes adopting the title of 'radical leftist',[73] \u017di\u017eek also controversially insists on identifying as a communist, even though he rejects 20th century communism as a \"total failure\", and decries \"the communism of the 20th century, more specifically all the network of phenomena we refer to as Stalinism as \"maybe the worst ideological, political, ethical, social (and so on) catastrophe in the history of humanity.\"[74] \u017di\u017eek justifies this choice by claiming that only the term 'communism' signals a genuine step outside of the existing order, in part since the term 'socialism' no longer has radical enough implications, and means nothing more than that one \"care[s] for society\"[75]\nIn Marx Reloaded, \u017di\u017eek rejects both 20th-century totalitarianism and \"spontaneous local self-organisation, direct democracy, councils, and so on\". There, he endorses a definition of communism as \"a society where you, everyone would be allowed to dwell in his or her stupidity\", an idea with which he credits Fredric Jameson as the inspiration.[76]\n\u017di\u017eek has labelled himself a \"communist in a qualified sense\".[77] When he spoke at a conference on The Idea of Communism, he applied (in qualified form) the 'communist' label to the Occupy Wall Street protestors:\n\nThey are not communists, if 'communism' means the system which deservedly collapsed in 1990\u2014and remember that the communists who are still in power today run the most ruthless capitalism (in China). ... The only sense in which the protestors are 'communists' is that they care for the commons\u2014the commons of nature, of knowledge\u2014which are threatened by the system. They are dismissed as dreamers, but the true dreamers are those who think that things can go on indefinitely the way they are now, with just a few cosmetic changes. They are not dreamers; they are awakening from a dream which is turning into a nightmare. They are not destroying anything; they are reacting to how the system is gradually destroying itself.[78]\n\u017di\u017eek has described himself as a \"moderately conservative Communist\".[79]\n\nElectoral politics[edit]\nIn May 2013, during Subversive Festival, \u017di\u017eek commented: \"If they don't support SYRIZA, then, in my vision of the democratic future, all these people will get from me [is] a first-class one-way ticket to [a] gulag.\" In response, the center-right New Democracy party claimed \u017di\u017eek's comments should be understood literally, not ironically.[80][81]\nJust before the 2017 French presidential election, \u017di\u017eek stated that one could not choose between Macron and Le Pen, arguing that the neoliberalism of Macron just gives rise to neofascism anyway. This was in response to many on the left calling for support for Macron to prevent a Le Pen victory.[82]\nIn 2022, \u017di\u017eek expressed his support for the Slovenian political party Levica (The Left) at its 5th annual conference.[83]\n\nSupport for Donald Trump's election[edit]\nIn a 2016 interview with Channel 4, \u017di\u017eek said that were he American, he would vote for Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election:\n\nI'm horrified at him [Trump]. I'm just thinking that Hillary is the true danger. ... if Trump wins, both big parties, Republicans and Democratics, would have to return to basics, rethink themselves, and maybe some things can happen there. That's my desperate, very desperate hope, that if Trump wins\u2014listen, America is not a dictatorial state, he will not introduce Fascism\u2014but it will be a kind of big awakening. New political processes will be set in motion, will be triggered. But I'm well aware that things are very dangerous here ... I'm just aware that Hillary stands for this absolute inertia, the most dangerous one. Because she is a cold warrior, and so on, connected with banks, pretending to be socially progressive.[84]\nThese views were derisively characterised as accelerationist by Left Voice,[85] and were labelled \"regressive\" by Noam Chomsky.[86]\nIn 2019 and 2020, \u017di\u017eek defended his views,[87] saying that Trump's election \"created, for the first time in I don't know how many decades, a true American left\", citing the boost it gave Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.[51]\nHowever, regarding the 2020 United States presidential election, \u017di\u017eek reported himself \"tempted by changing his position\", saying \"Trump is a little too much\".[51] In another interview, he stood by his 2016 \"wager\" that Trump's election would lead to a socialist reaction (\"maybe I was right\"), but claimed that \"now with coronavirus: no, no\u2014no Trump. ... difficult as it is for me to say this, but now I would say 'Biden better than Trump', although he is far from ideal.\"[88] In his 2022 book, Heaven in Disorder, \u017di\u017eek continued to express a preference for Joe Biden over Donald Trump, stating \"Trump was corroding the ethical substance of our lives\", while Biden lies and represents big capital more politely.[89]\n\nSocial issues[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek's views on social issues such as Eurocentrism, immigration and the LGBT movement have drawn criticism and accusations of bigotry.[90]\n\nEurope and multiculturalism[edit]\nIn his 1997 article 'Multiculturalism, Or, The Cultural Logic of Multinational Capitalism', \u017di\u017eek critiqued multiculturalism for privileging a culturally 'neutral' perspective from which all cultures are disaffectedly apprehended in their particularity because this distancing reproduces the racist procedure of Othering. He further argues that a fixation on particular identities and struggles corresponds to an abandonment of the universal struggle against global capitalism.[91]\nIn his 1998 article 'A Leftist Plea for \"Eurocentrism\"', he argued that Leftists should 'undermine the global empire of capital, not by asserting particular identities, but through the assertion of a new universality',[92] and that in this struggle the European universalist value of egaliberte (Etienne Balibar's term) should be foregrounded, proposing 'a Leftist appropriation of the European legacy'.[93] Elsewhere, he has also argued, defending Marx, that Europe's destruction of non-European tradition (e.g. through imperialism and slavery) has opened up the space for a 'double liberation', both from tradition and from European domination.[94]\nIn her 2010 article 'The Two Zizeks', Nivedita Menon criticised \u017di\u017eek for focusing on differentiation as a colonial project, ignoring how assimilation was also such a project; she also critiqued him for privileging the European Enlightenment Christian legacy as neutral, 'free of the cultural markers that fatally afflict all other religions.'[95] David Pav\u00f3n Cu\u00e9llar, closer to \u017di\u017eek, also criticised him.[96]\nIn the mid-2010s, over the issue of Eurocentrism, there was a dispute between \u017di\u017eek and Walter Mignolo, in which Mignolo (supporting a previous article by Hamid Dabashi,[97] which argued against the centrality of European philosophers like \u017di\u017eek, criticised by Michael Marder[98]) argued, against \u017di\u017eek, that decolonial struggle should forget European philosophy, purportedly following Frantz Fanon;[99] in response, \u017di\u017eek pointed out Fanon's European intellectual influences, and his resistance to being confined within the black tradition, and claimed to be following Fanon on this point.[100] In his book Can Non-Europeans Think? (foreworded by Mignolo), Dabashi also critiqued \u017di\u017eek for privileging Europe;[101] \u017di\u017eek argued that Dabashi slanderously and comically misrepresents him through misattribution,[102] a critique supported by Ilan Kapoor.[90]\n\nTransgender issues[edit]\nIn his 2016 article \"The Sexual Is Political\", \u017di\u017eek argued that all subjects are, like transgender subjects, in discord with the sexual position assigned to them. For \u017di\u017eek, any attempt to escape this antagonism is false and utopian: thus, he rejects both the reactionary attempt to violently impose sexual fixity and the \"postgenderist\" attempt to escape sexual fixity entirely; he aligns the latter with 'transgenderism', which he claims does not adequately describe the behaviour of actual transgender subjects, who seek a stable \"place where they could recognise themselves\" (ie a bathroom that confirms their identity). \u017di\u017eek argues for a third bathroom: a \"GENERAL GENDER\" bathroom that would represent the fact that both sexual positions (\u017di\u017eek insists on the unavoidable \"twoness\" of the sexual landscape) are missing something and thus fail to adequately represent the subjects that take them on.[103]\nIn his 2019 article \"Transgender dogma is naive and incompatible with Freud\", \u017di\u017eek argued that there is \"a tension in LGBT+ ideology between social constructivism and (some kind of biological) determinism\", between the idea that gender is a social construct, and the idea that gender is essential and pre-social. He concludes the essay with a \"Freudian solution\" to this deadlock:\n\n...psychic sexual identity is a choice, not a biological fact, but it is not a conscious choice that the subject can playfully repeat and transform. It is an unconscious choice which precedes subjective constitution and which is, as such, formative of subjectivity, which means that the change of this choice entails the radical transformation of the bearer of the choice.[104] \nChe Gossett criticized \u017di\u017eek for his use of the \"pathologising\" term \"transgenderism\" throughout the 2016 article, and for writing \"about trans subjectivity with such assumed authority while ignoring the voices of trans theorists (academics and activists) entirely\", as well as for purportedly claiming that a \"futuristic\" vision underlies so-called \"transgenderism\", ignoring present-day oppression.[105] Sam Warren Miell and Chris Coffman, both psychoanalytically inclined, have separately criticized \u017di\u017eek for conflating transgenderism and postgenderism; Miell further criticised the 2014 article for rehearsing homophobic/transphobic clich\u00e9s (including \u017di\u017eek's designation of inter-species marriage as a possible \"anti-discriminatory demand\"), and misusing Lacanian theory; Coffman argued that \u017di\u017eek should have engaged with contemporary Lacanian trans studies, which would have shown that psychoanalytic and transgender discourses were aligned, not opposed.[106] In response to the title of the 2019 article, McKenzie Wark had t-shirts made with the transgender flag and \"Incompatible with Freud\" printed on them.[107]\n\u017di\u017eek defended his 2016 article in two follow-up pieces. The first addresses purported misreadings of his position,[108] while the second is a more sustained defence (against Miell) of the article's application of Lacanian theory,[109] to which Miell responded in turn.[110] Douglas Lain also defended \u017di\u017eek, claiming that context makes that it clear that \u017di\u017eek is \"not opposed [to] the struggle of LGBTQ people\" but is instead critiquing \"a phony liberal ideology that set up the terms of the LGBTQ struggle\", \"a certain utopian postmodern ideology that seeks to eliminate all limits, to eliminate all binaries, to go beyond norms because the imposition of a limit is patriarchal and oppressive.\"[111]\nIn a 2023 piece for Compact Magazine, \u017di\u017eek took a hard stance against access to puberty blockers for trans youth, and against trans adults being sent to prisons matching their gender, citing the case of Isla Bryson, whom he referred to as \"a person who identifies itself as a woman using its penis to rape two women\". Both of these things were attributed by \u017di\u017eek to wokeness (the wider subject of the article).[112][113]\n\nOther[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek wrote that the convention center in which nationalist Slovene writers hold their conventions should be blown up, adding, \"Since we live in the time without any sense of irony, I must add I don't mean it literally.\"[114]\n\nIn 2013, \u017di\u017eek corresponded with imprisoned Russian activist and Pussy Riot member Nadezhda Tolokonnikova.[115]All hearts were beating for you as long as you were perceived as just another version of the liberal-democratic protest against the authoritarian state. The moment it became clear that you rejected global capitalism, reporting on Pussy Riot became much more ambiguous.\nHe criticized Western military interventions in developing countries and wrote that it was the 2011 military intervention in Libya \"which threw the country in chaos\" and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq \"which created the conditions for the rise\" of the Islamic State.[116]\n\u017di\u017eek believes that China is the combination of capitalism and authoritarianism in their extreme forms, and the Chinese Communist Party is the best protector of the interests of capitalists. From the Cultural Revolution to Deng's reforms, \"Mao himself created the ideological condition for rapid capitalist development by tearing apart the fabric of traditional society.\"[117]\n\nIt is capitalism, again and again, that emerges as the only alternative, the only way to move forward and the dynamic force for change when social life gets stuck into some fixed form. Today, capitalism is much more revolutionary than the traditional Left obsessed with protecting the old achievements of the welfare state. Just consider how much capitalism has changed the entire texture of our societies in the past decades.\nIn an opinion article for The Guardian, \u017di\u017eek argued in favour of giving full support to Ukraine after the Russian invasion and for creating a stronger NATO in response to Russian aggression,[118] later arguing that it would also be a tragedy for Ukraine to yoke itself to western neoliberalism.[119] He compared the struggle of Ukraine against the occupiers to the Palestinians' struggle against the Israeli occupation.[120]\n\nCriticism and controversy[edit]\nInconsistency and ambiguity[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek's philosophical and political positions have been described as ambiguous, and his work has been criticized for a failure to take a consistent stance.[121] While he has claimed to stand by a revolutionary Marxist project, his lack of vision concerning the possible circumstances which could lead to successful revolution makes it unclear what that project consists of. According to John Gray and John Holbo, his theoretical argument often lacks grounding in historical fact, which makes him more provocative than insightful.[122][123][124]\nIn a very negative review of \u017di\u017eek's book Less than Nothing, the British political philosopher John Gray attacked \u017di\u017eek for his celebrations of violence, his failure to ground his theories in historical facts, and his 'formless radicalism' which, according to Gray, professes to be communist yet lacks the conviction that communism could ever be successfully realized. Gray concluded that \u017di\u017eek's work, though entertaining, is intellectually worthless: \"Achieving a deceptive substance by endlessly reiterating an essentially empty vision, \u017di\u017eek's work amounts in the end to less than nothing.\"[122]\n\u017di\u017eek's refusal to present an alternative vision has led critics to accuse him of using unsustainable Marxist categories of analysis and having a 19th-century understanding of class.[125] For example, post-Marxist Ernesto Laclau argued that \"\u017di\u017eek uses class as a sort of deus ex machina to play the role of the good guy against the multicultural devils.\"[126]\nIn his book Living in the End Times, \u017di\u017eek suggests that the criticism of his positions is itself ambiguous and multilateral:\n\n... I am attacked for being anti-Semitic and for spreading Zionist lies, for being a covert Slovene nationalist and unpatriotic traitor to my nation, for being a crypto-Stalinist defending terror and for spreading Bourgeois lies about Communism... so maybe, just maybe I am on the right path, the path of fidelity to freedom.\"[127]\nStylistic confusion[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek has been criticized for his chaotic and non-systematic style: Harpham calls \u017di\u017eek's style \"a stream of nonconsecutive units arranged in arbitrary sequences that solicit a sporadic and discontinuous attention\".[128] O'Neill concurs: \"a dizzying array of wildly entertaining and often quite maddening rhetorical strategies are deployed in order to beguile, browbeat, dumbfound, dazzle, confuse, mislead, overwhelm, and generally subdue the reader into acceptance.\"[129] Noam Chomsky deems \u017di\u017eek guilty of \"using fancy terms like polysyllables and pretending you have a theory when you have no theory whatsoever\", adding that his views are often too obscure to be communicated usefully to common people.[130]\nConservative thinker Roger Scruton claims that: \n\nTo summarize \u017di\u017eek's position is not easy: he slips between philosophical and psychoanalytical ways of arguing, and is spell-bound by Lacan's gnomic utterances. He is a lover of paradox, and believes strongly in what Hegel called 'the labour of the negative' though taking the idea, as always, one stage further towards the brick wall of paradox.[131]\nCareless scholarship[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek has been accused of approaching phenomena without rigour, reductively forcing them to support pre-given theoretical notions. For example, Tania Modleski alleges that \"in trying to make Hitchcock 'fit' Lacan, he [\u017di\u017eek] frequently ends up simplifying what goes on in the films\".[132] Similarly, Yannis Stavrakakis criticises \u017di\u017eek's reading of Antigone, claiming it proceeds without regard for both the play itself and the interpretation, given by Lacan in his 7th Seminar, which \u017di\u017eek claims to follow. According to Stavrakakis, \u017di\u017eek mistakenly characterises Antigone's act (illegally burying her brother) as politically radical/revolutionary, when in reality \"Her act is a one-off and she couldn't care less about what will happen in the polis after her suicide.\"[133]\nNoah Horwitz alleges that \u017di\u017eek (and the Ljubljana School to which \u017di\u017eek belongs) mistakenly conflates the insights of Lacan and Hegel, and registers concern that such a move \"risks transforming Lacanian psychoanalysis into a discourse of self-consciousness rather than a discourse on the psychoanalytic, Freudian unconscious.\"[134]\n\nAllegations of plagiarism[edit]\n\u017di\u017eek's tendency to recycle portions of his own texts in subsequent works resulted in the accusation of self-plagiarism by The New York Times in 2014, after \u017di\u017eek published an op-ed in the magazine which contained portions of his writing from an earlier book.[135] In response, \u017di\u017eek expressed perplexity at the harsh tone of the denunciation, emphasizing that the recycled passages in question only acted as references from his theoretical books to supplement otherwise original writing.[135]\nIn July 2014, Newsweek reported that online bloggers led by Steve Sailer had discovered that in an article published in 2006, \u017di\u017eek plagiarized long passages from an earlier review by Stanley Hornbeck that first appeared in the journal American Renaissance, a publication condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center as the organ of a \"white nationalist hate group\".[136] In response to the allegations, \u017di\u017eek stated:\n\nThe friend send [sic] it to me, assuring me that I can use it freely since it merely resumes another's line of thought. Consequently, I did just that\u2014and I sincerely apologize for not knowing that my friend's resume was largely borrowed from Stanley Hornbeck's review of Macdonald's book.... In no way can I thus be accused of plagiarizing another's line of thought, of 'stealing ideas'. I nonetheless deeply regret the incident.[137]\nWorks[edit]\nBibliography[edit]\nMain article: Slavoj \u017di\u017eek bibliography\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\n\n1993\n\nLaibach: A Film From Slovenia\n\n\n1996\n\nLiebe Dein Symptom wie Dich selbst!\n\n\nPredictions of Fire\n\n\n1997\n\nPost-Socialism+Retro Avantgarde+Irwin\n\n\n2004\n\nThe Reality of the Virtual\n\n\n2005\n\nZizek!\n\n\n2006\n\nThe Pervert's Guide to Cinema\n\n\nThe Possibility of Hope\n\n\n2008\n\nExamined Life\n\n\nViolence[138]\n\n\n2009\n\nTerror!

She was the Democratic nominee in the 2022 Georgia gubernatorial election, and lost again to Kemp, this time by a much larger margin; she conceded on the night of the election.[12]\nAbrams is an author of both fiction and nonfiction. Her nonfiction books, Our Time Is Now and Lead from the Outside, were New York Times best sellers. Abrams wrote eight fiction books under the pen name Selena Montgomery before 2021. While Justice Sleeps was released on May 11, 2021, under her real name. Abrams also wrote a children's book, Stacey's Extraordinary Words, released in December 2021.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nThe second of six siblings, Abrams was born to Robert and Carolyn Abrams in Madison, Wisconsin, and raised in Gulfport, Mississippi where her father was employed in a shipyard and her mother was a librarian.[13][14][15]  In 1989, the family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where her parents pursued graduate divinity degrees at Emory University.[16][17] They became Methodist ministers and later returned to Mississippi with their three youngest children while Abrams and two other siblings remained in Atlanta.[16][18][19] She attended Avondale High School, graduating as valedictorian in 1991.[20] In 1990, she was selected for the Telluride Association Summer Program.[21] At 17, while still in high school, she was hired as a typist for a congressional campaign and then as a speechwriter based on the improvements she made to a campaign speech.[22]\nIn 1995, Abrams earned a Bachelor of Arts in interdisciplinary studies (political science, economics, and sociology) from Spelman College, magna cum laude.[2] While in college, she worked in the youth services department in the office of Atlanta mayor Maynard Jackson.[22] She later interned at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.[22] As a freshman in 1992, Abrams took part in a protest on the steps of the Georgia Capitol, during which she joined in burning the Georgia state flag which, at the time, incorporated the Confederate battle flag. It had been added to the state flag in 1956 as an anti-civil rights movement action.[23][24][25]\nAs a Harry S. Truman Scholar, Abrams studied public policy at the University of Texas at Austin's LBJ School of Public Affairs, where she earned a Master of Public Affairs degree in 1998. Afterward, she earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School.[2]\n\nLegal and business career\nAfter graduating from law school, Abrams worked as a tax attorney at the Sutherland Asbill & Brennan law firm in Atlanta, with a focus on tax-exempt organizations, health care, and public finance.[2] In 2010, while a member of the Georgia General Assembly, Abrams co-founded and served as the senior vice president of NOW Corp. (formerly NOWaccount Network Corporation), a financial services firm.[26][27]\nAbrams is CEO of Sage Works, a legal consulting firm that has represented clients including the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association.[28]\n\nNourish and Now\nAbrams co-founded Nourish, Inc. in 2010.[29] Originally conceived as a beverage company with a focus on infants and toddlers,[30] it was later rebranded as Now and pivoted its business model to an invoicing solution for small businesses. Now raised a $9.5 million Series A in 2021.[29]\n\nRewiring America\nIn mid-March 2023, community electrification advocacy nonprofit group Rewiring America announced it had hired Abrams as senior counsel.[31][32]\n\nPolitical career\nIn 2002, at age 29, Abrams was appointed a deputy city attorney for the City of Atlanta.[2][33]\n\nGeorgia General Assembly\nIn 2006, Abrams ran for the 84th District for the Georgia House of Representatives, following JoAnn McClinton's announcement that she would not seek reelection. Abrams ran in the Democratic Party primary election against former state legislator George Maddox and political operative Dexter Porter. She outraised her two opponents and won the primary election with 51% of the vote, avoiding a runoff election.[34]\n\nAbrams in 2012\nAbrams represented House District 84 beginning in the 2007 session,[35] and beginning in the 2013 session (following reapportionment), District 89. Both districts covered portions of the City of Atlanta and unincorporated DeKalb County,[36] covering the communities of Candler Park, Cedar Grove, Columbia, Druid Hills, Edgewood, Highland Park, Kelley Lake, Kirkwood, Lake Claire, South DeKalb, Toney Valley, and Tilson.[37][38] She served on the Appropriations, Ethics, Judiciary Non-Civil, Rules, and Ways & Means committees.[39]\nIn November 2010, the Democratic caucus elected Abrams to succeed DuBose Porter as minority leader over Virgil Fludd.[40] Abrams's first major action as minority leader was to cooperate with Republican governor Nathan Deal's administration to reform the HOPE Scholarship program. She co-sponsored the 2011 legislation that preserved the HOPE program by decreasing the scholarship amount paid to Georgia students and funded a 1% low-interest loan program for students.[41]\nAccording to Time magazine, Abrams \"can credibly boast of having single-handedly stopped the largest tax increase in Georgia history.\"[42] In 2011 Abrams argued that a Republican proposal to cut income taxes while increasing a tax on cable service would lead to a net increase in taxes paid by most people.[42] She performed an analysis of the bill that showed that 82% of Georgians would see net tax increases, and left a copy of the analysis on the desk of every House legislator.[42] The bill subsequently failed.[42]\n\nAbrams with John Lewis in 2017\nAbrams also worked with Deal on criminal-justice reforms that reduced prison costs without increasing crime,[42] and with Republicans on the state's biggest-ever public transportation funding package.[42]\nOn August 25, 2017, Abrams resigned from the General Assembly to focus on her gubernatorial campaign.[43]\n\n2018 gubernatorial campaign\nMain article: 2018 Georgia gubernatorial electionStacey Abrams campaigns in 2018 for Governor of Georgia.\n\n\nWikinews has related news:\n Stacey Abrams becomes first black woman to gain major U.S. party nomination for governor of Georgia\n\nAbrams ran for governor of Georgia in 2018.[44] In the Democratic primary she ran against Stacey Evans, another member of the Georgia House of Representatives,[44] in what some called \"the battle of the Staceys\". Abrams was endorsed by Bernie Sanders and Our Revolution.[45][46] On May 22, she won the Democratic nomination, making her the first Black woman in the U.S. to be a major party's nominee for governor.[7] After winning the primary, Abrams secured a number of high-profile endorsements, including one from former president Barack Obama.[47][48]\nAlmost a week before election day, the Republican nominee, Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp, canceled a debate scheduled seven weeks earlier to attend a Trump rally. Kemp blamed Abrams for the cancellation, saying she was unwilling to reschedule it. Abrams's campaign manager responded, \"We refuse to callously take Georgians for granted and cancel on them. Just because Brian Kemp breaks his promises doesn't mean anyone else should.\"[49]\nTwo days before the election, Kemp's office announced that it was investigating the Georgia Democratic Party for unspecified \"possible cybercrimes\"; the Georgia Democratic Party stated that \"Kemp's scurrilous claims are 100 percent false\" and described them as a \"political stunt\".[50] A 2020 investigation by the Georgia attorney general's office concluded that there was no evidence of computer crimes.[51] Later that year, it was revealed that the alleged cybercrime against Kemp's office was in fact a planned security test that one of Kemp's staff members had signed off on three months prior.[52]\nAs Georgia's secretary of state, Kemp was in charge of elections and voter registration during the election. Kemp was accused of voter suppression during the election between him and Abrams.[53][54][55] Emory University professor Carol Anderson has criticized Kemp as an \"enemy of democracy\" and \"an expert in voter suppression\" for his actions as secretary of state.[56] Political scientists Michael Bernhard and Daniel O'Neill described Kemp's actions in the 2018 gubernatorial election as the worst case of voter suppression in that election year.[57] Election law expert Richard L. Hasen called Kemp \"perhaps the most incompetent state chief elections officer\" in the 2018 elections, pointing to a number of actions that jeopardized Georgia's election security and made it harder for eligible voters to vote.[58] Hasen writes that it was \"hard to tell\" which of Kemp's \"actions were due to incompetence and which were attempted suppression.\"[58]\nBetween 2012 and 2018, Kemp's office canceled over 1.4 million voter registrations, with nearly 700,000 cancellations in 2017 alone.[59] On a single night in July 2017, half a million voters had their registrations canceled. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, election-law experts said that this \"may represent the largest mass disenfranchisement in US history.\"[60] Kemp oversaw the removals as secretary of state, and did so eight months after he declared his candidacy for governor.[61] An investigative journalism group run by Greg Palast found that of the approximately 534,000 Georgians whose voter registrations were purged between 2016 and 2017, more than 334,000 still lived where they were registered.[62] The voters were given no notice that they had been purged.[63] Palast sued Kemp, claiming over 300,000 voters were purged illegally.[64] Kemp's office denied any wrongdoing, saying that by \"regularly updating our rolls, we prevent fraud and ensure that all votes are cast by eligible Georgia voters.\"[65]\n\nAbrams in 2018\nBy early October 2018, more than 53,000 voter registration applications had been put on hold by Kemp's office, with more than 75% belonging to minorities.[66][59] The voters were eligible to re-register if they still lived in Georgia.[67][59][61][62]\nIn a ruling against Kemp, district judge Amy Totenberg found that Kemp's office had violated the Help America Vote Act and said an attempt by Kemp's office to expedite the certification of results \"appears to suggest the secretary's foregoing of its responsibility to confirm the accuracy of the results prior to final certification, including the assessment of whether serious provisional balloting count issues have been consistently and properly handled.\"[68][69]\nOn November 6, 2018, Abrams lost the election by 54,723 votes.[70] On November 16, 2018, Abrams announced that she was ending her campaign. She emphasized that her statement was not a concession, because \"concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true, or proper\", but acknowledged that she could not close the gap with Kemp to force a runoff.[71] In her campaign-ending speech, Abrams announced the creation of Fair Fight Action, a voting rights nonprofit organization that sued the secretary of state and state election board in federal court for voter suppression.[72]\nFair Fight's lawsuit was initiated in December 2018; according to Politico, it \"started as a sprawling case that included allegations of unreasonably long lines and wait times caused by moving and closing polling places; the impact of voter ID rules on people of color, voters with non-Anglo Saxon names and newly naturalized citizens; improper maintenance of Georgia's voter rolls; inadequate training of poll workers; and even the integrity of voting machines\".[73] Six months after the lawsuit began, the Georgia legislature passed a law addressing some of its claims, with measures including the implementation of new voting machines with more advanced technology.[74] Fair Fight dropped the claims about voting machines in December 2020, around the time that Donald Trump made baseless claims about voting machine problems in Georgia affecting the 2020 presidential election.[73] In February 2021, a federal judge ruled that Fair Fight's claims about voting machines, voter list security, and polling place issues were resolved by changes in Georgia's election law, or invalidated due to lack of standing to sue.[74][75]\nIn April 2021, a judge allowed some claims in the legal challenge to proceed while rejecting others.[74] In October 2022, a federal judge ruled against Fair Fight on the remaining claims, finding that Georgia's voting regulations did not violate the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.[76][77][78] According to the judge, the case \"resulted in wins and losses for all parties over the course of the litigation and culminated in what is believed to have been the longest voting rights bench trial in the history of the Northern District of Georgia.\"[73][79][80] Over the course of the lawsuit, Fair Fight raised $61 million and paid millions to Allegra Lawrence-Hardy, Abrams's campaign chair.[73]\nSince losing the election, Abrams has repeatedly said that the election was not fairly conducted[9] and has declined to call Kemp the legitimate governor of Georgia.[81] Abrams has since said that she won the election and that the election was \"stolen from the voters of Georgia\", claims that election law expert Richard L. Hasen said were unproven, though he argued that \"it's clear that Kemp did everything in his power to put in place restrictive voting policies that would help his candidacy and hurt his opponent, all while overseeing his own election.\"[82] Abrams argued that Kemp, who oversaw the election in his role as secretary of state, had a conflict of interest and suppressed turnout by purging nearly 670,000 voter registrations in 2017, and that about 53,000 voter registrations were pending a month before the election.[9][83] She has said, \"I have no empirical evidence that I would have achieved a higher number of votes. However, I have sufficient and I think legally sufficient doubt about the process to say that it was not a fair election.\"[9]\nOn November 9, 2018, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that its investigation of the 2018 statewide elections in Georgia had found \"no evidence ... of systematic malfeasance \u2013 or of enough tainted votes to force a runoff election\".[84] A USA Today fact check noted that the actions Kemp's office took during the election \"can be explained as routine under state and federal law\"; political scientist Charles S. Bullock III said there is \"not much empirical evidence supporting the assertion that Kemp either suppressed the vote or 'stole' the election from Abrams.\"[85]\nAccording to Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler, Abrams has variously claimed that she \"won\" the election, that the election was \"rigged\", that it was \"stolen\", that it was not \"free and fair\", and that Kemp had \"cheated\". Kessler said that \"Abrams played up claims the election was stolen until such tactics became untenable for anyone who claims to be an advocate for American democratic norms and values\".[86]\n\nRole in federal politics\nStacey Abrams and Nancy Pelosi in January 2019\nOn January 29, 2019, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced that Abrams would deliver the response to the State of the Union address on February 5.[87] She was the first African-American woman to give the rebuttal to the address, as well as the first and only non-office-holding person to do so since the State of the Union responses began in 1966.[88] Despite being heavily recruited by Schumer, the Democratic National Committee, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to challenge incumbent senator David Perdue, on April 30, 2019, Abrams announced that she would not run for the U.S. Senate in 2020.[89] After Senator Johnny Isakson announced his resignation due to poor health, Abrams declined to run in that election as well, citing a need to focus on ending voter suppression.\nOn August 17, 2019, Abrams announced the founding of Fair Fight 2020,[90] an organization to assist Democrats financially and technically to build voter protection teams in 20 states.[91] Abrams is Fair Fight Action 2020's chair.[92] Billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg contributed $5 million shortly after announcing his run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.[93][94] On ABC's The View, Abrams defended Bloomberg's spending, saying: \"Every person is allowed to run and should run the race that they think they should run, and Mike Bloomberg has chosen to use his finances. Other people are using their dog, their charisma, their whatever.\"[95] Abrams declined to endorse Bloomberg personally.[96]\nDuring the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, Abrams actively promoted herself for consideration as former vice president Joe Biden's running mate.[97] Kamala Harris was officially announced as Biden's running mate on August 11, 2020.[98] Abrams was selected as one of 17 speakers to jointly deliver the keynote address at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.[99]\nAfter Biden won the 2020 U.S. presidential election, both The New York Times and The Washington Post credited Abrams with a large boost in Democratic votes in Georgia and an estimated 800,000 new voter registrations.[6][100] As part of that election, she served as an elector for the state of Georgia.[101]\n\n2022 gubernatorial campaign\nMain article: 2022 Georgia gubernatorial election\nOn December 1, 2021, Abrams announced she would run again for governor of Georgia.[102] She ran unopposed in the Democratic primary on May 24, 2022, and faced Georgia governor Brian Kemp in the November 8 general election.[103] Abrams and Kemp had their first of two scheduled debates on October 17. In the debate, Abrams emphasized her support for gun control and legal access to abortion, while Kemp emphasized Georgia's economy under his governorship and his anti-crime proposals.[104] When asked whether she would accept the results of the election, Abrams declined to directly respond.[105] In the final debate before the election both candidates agreed to accept the results.[106] Abrams lost the November 8, 2022 election to Kemp; she conceded that night.[12]\n\nPolitical positions\nAbrams supports abortion rights, advocates for expanded gun control, and opposes proposals for stricter voter ID laws. She has argued that some implementations of voter ID laws disenfranchise minorities and the poor,[107][108] but does not oppose voter ID laws in principle and supports voters having to verify their identities.[109][110] Abrams pledged to oppose legislation similar to the religious liberty bill that Governor Deal vetoed in 2016.[111][112]\n\nCriminal justice reform\nAbrams supports criminal justice reform in the form of no cash bail for poor defendants, abolishing the death penalty, and decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana.[107][113] She also supports community policing to keep communities safe as part of criminal justice reform.[114]\n\nEducation\nAbrams would like to increase spending on public education.[42] She opposes private school vouchers, instead advocating improvements to the public education system. She supports smaller class sizes, more school counselors, protected pensions, better pay for teachers, and expanded early childhood education.[115]\n\nHealth care\nIn her campaign for governor, Abrams said her top priority was Medicaid expansion.[42][116] She cited research showing that Medicaid expansion improved health care access for low-income residents and made hospitals in rural locations financially viable.[116] She also created a plan to address Georgia's high maternal mortality rate.[117]\n\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\nAbrams is a strong supporter of Israel and rejects \"the demonization and delegitimization of Israel represented\" by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign, which she has called \"anti-Semitic\".[118][119] But she voted against Georgia's anti-BDS legislation that punishes companies that choose to boycott Israel or Israeli-occupied territories.[120] Abrams wrote, \"Boycotts have been a critical part of social justice in American history, particularly for African-Americans. As the Anti-Defamation League notes, the origin of BDS is based in the anti-apartheid movement.\"[118]\n\nWriting career\nOutside of politics, Abrams has found success as a fiction writer. Until 2021, she published her works under the pen name Selena Montgomery. She claims to have sold more than 100,000 copies of her novels.[39] She wrote her first novel during her third year at Yale Law School and published her most recent book in 2009.[121] Her legal thriller While Justice Sleeps was published (under her own name) in May 2021.[122] That novel is being produced as a television series by Working Title Films, a subsidiary of Universal Pictures.[123][124]\nTwo of her nonfiction works, Our Time is Now and Lead from the Outside, were New York Times Best Sellers.[125]\nAbrams has published articles on public policy, taxation, and nonprofit organizations.[126] She is the author of Minority Leader: How to Lead from the Outside and Make Real Change (published by Henry Holt & Co. in April 2018),[127] and Our Time Is Now: Power, Purpose, and the Fight for a Fair America (published by Henry Holt & Co. in June 2020).[128]\n\nHonors and awards\nIn 2012, Abrams received the John F.

He is an adviser at the Forbes School of Business & Technology.[2] Forbes was a candidate in the 1996[3] and 2000 Republican presidential primaries.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nForbes was born in Morristown, New Jersey, to Roberta Remsen (n\u00e9e Laidlaw) and Malcolm Forbes.[4][5] Forbes grew up in Far Hills, New Jersey. He attended the Far Hills Country Day School with his longtime friend and future Governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman. He graduated cum laude from Brooks School in North Andover, Massachusetts, in 1966.\nForbes graduated with an A.B. in history from Princeton University in 1970 after completing a 75-page long senior thesis titled \"Contest for the 1892 Democratic Presidential Nomination.\"[6][7] While at Princeton, Forbes founded his first magazine, Business Today, with two other students. Business Today is currently the largest student-run magazine in the world.[8] Forbes is a member of Alpha Kappa Psi and Tau Kappa Epsilon.[9] He holds honorary degrees from several universities, including New York Institute of Technology and Lehigh University.[10]\n\nPolitical career and views[edit]\nEarly political career[edit]\nIn 1985, President Ronald Reagan appointed Forbes as head of the Board of International Broadcasting (BIB), which historically managed the operation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Reagan's successor, George H. W. Bush reappointed Forbes to the position. Forbes would continue to serve as the BIB's leader until 1993, following the inauguration of Bill Clinton.[11]\nFollowing his career as the BIB's head, Forbes went on to get involved in various conservative political advocacy groups. From 1993 to 1996, Forbes was the chairman of the Board of Directors of \"Empower America\", which later merged with the advocacy group FreedomWorks.[11] Through \"Empower America\", Forbes became associates with prominent conservative politician Jack Kemp, who would go on to endorse Forbes during the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries.[12] From 1996 to 1999, Forbes also served as honorary chairman of the advocacy group \"Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity\", described as \"a grassroots, issues-advocacy organization founded to advance pro-growth, pro-freedom and pro-family issues.\"[11]\nForbes helped craft Christine Todd Whitman's[13] plan for a 30% cut in New Jersey's income tax over three years, and this plan proved to be a major factor in her victory over incumbent Governor James Florio.[14][15] Despite Forbes and Whitman being childhood friends, Forbes would later distance himself from Whitman during his bid for the Republican nomination in 2000 owing to Whitman's pro-choice stance on abortion.[16]\n\nCampaigns for president[edit]\nLogo from 1996 campaign\nForbes entered the Republican primaries for President of the United States in 1996 and 2000, primarily running on a campaign to establish a flat income tax (Forbes's emphasis on the flat tax proposal was so heavy that he was described as a \"single-issue candidate\", a label he claimed was inaccurate[17]). Forbes believed the American taxation system had become too Byzantine and bureaucratic and was in desperate need of reform and simplification.[18] Forbes also supported the ideas of reintroducing 4.5% mortgages and term limits in 1996; however, he dropped both in 2000, as they were minor planks in his overall platform.[citation needed]\nWhen Forbes ran for president in 1996 and 2000, he sold some of his Forbes, Inc. voting shares to other family members to help finance his run. Forbes did not come close to securing the Republican nomination, despite winning the Arizona and Delaware primaries in 1996 and getting some significant shares of the vote in other primaries. Forbes's \"awkward\" campaigning style was considered to be a major factor in his defeat.[19] Time Magazine called his stumping a \"comedy-club impression of what would happen if some mad scientist decided to construct a dork robot.\"[19] Jeff Lyon of The Chicago Tribune wrote of Forbes on the campaign trail, \"[Forbes] resembles the classic milquetoast, with a prissy smile, gold-rimmed glasses that make his eyes look smaller, and a stiff way of presenting himself when he works a crowd. He has a cornball style and uses preppie slang like 'get real' and 'el zippo' (meaning zero) in speeches.\"[20] Forbes and his campaign staff were known for travelling between campaign stops via their \"big silver bus.\"[21][22] For his 2000 presidential campaign, he raised $86,000,000 in campaign contributions, of which $37,000,000 was self-donated.[23]\n\nLogo from 2000 campaign\nAfter dropping out early in the 2000 primary season, Forbes returned to heading the magazine and company. During the 1996 campaign, insiders at Fortune alleged that stories about Forbes's advertisers became favorably biased toward them.[24]\nMajor issues Forbes has supported include free trade, health savings accounts, and allowing people to opt out 75% of Social Security payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts (PRAs). Forbes supports traditional Republican Party policies such as downsizing government agencies to balance the budget, tough crime laws, support for the death penalty, and school vouchers. Forbes opposes gun control and most government regulation of the environment, as well as drug legalization and same-sex marriage,[25] in spite of his father being gay.[26] In terms of foreign policy, he called for a \"US not UN foreign policy\" (which is composed of anti-International Monetary Fund sentiments, pro-Israeli sentiment, opposition to Most Favored Nation status for the People's Republic of China, and anti-UN sentiment.)\nForbes's flat-tax plan has changed slightly. In 1996, Forbes supported a flat tax of 17% on all personal and corporate earned income (unearned income such as capital gains, pensions, inheritance, and savings would be exempt). However, Forbes supported keeping the first $33,000 of income exempt. In 2000, Forbes maintained the same plan; however, instead of each person receiving an exemption of $33,000, it more closely resembled the Armey Plan (Forbes's version called for a $13,000-per-adult and $5,000-per-dependent deduction). Forbes is very wealthy, with a net worth in 1996 of $430 million.[3] In response to this criticism, Forbes promised in his 2000 campaign to exempt himself from the benefits of the flat tax, although he did support the repeal of the 16th Amendment in a debate with Alan Keyes the previous year.\nIn his 2000 campaign, Forbes professed his support for social conservatism along with his supply-side economics. Despite holding opposite positions in 1996, for the 2000 campaign Forbes announced he was adamantly opposed to abortion and supported prayer in public schools. The previous year Forbes had issued a statement saying he would no longer donate money to Princeton University because of its hiring of philosopher Peter Singer, who views personhood as being limited to 'sentient' beings and therefore considers some disabled people and all infants to lack this status. Steve Forbes was one of the signers of the Statement of Principles of Project for the New American Century (PNAC) on June 3, 1997.\n\nOther political activities[edit]\nIn 1996, Forbes campaigned on behalf of Ron Paul in the congressional election for Texas's 14th congressional district.[27]\nActor Mark McKinney played Steve Forbes on the comedy television show Saturday Night Live, a program known for featuring political satire. In an episode which aired on March 16, 1996\u2014shortly after Forbes dropped out of the 1996 presidential race\u2014McKinney played Forbes in a skit in which Forbes purchases land in Russia to found his own country, called \"Forbes America\".[28] Forbes himself hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live that aired on April 13, 1996. The episode featured a skit in which Forbes earnestly wishes to answer the questions of potential voters, but all the questions he receives instead have to do with his enormous personal wealth (for example, with regards to the then ongoing war in Bosnia, Forbes is asked by an audience member, \"Why don't you just buy Bosnia and tell all those people over there that if they don't stop fighting you'll just, you know, throw them the hell out?\").[29] On that same episode, Forbes starred in a skit, playing a roofer, the comedy deriving from Forbes's character being a tough blue collar worker, a personality which clashes with Forbes's nerdy, intellectual demeanor and appearance.[30] The episode also featured a skit where the real Forbes interviewed his SNL counterpart, played by McKinney.[31]\nIn December 2006, Forbes joined the Board of Directors of the advocacy organization FreedomWorks. Forbes is also on the board of directors of the National Taxpayers Union. Forbes is also a member of the board of trustees of The Heritage Foundation, an influential Washington, D.C.-based public policy research institute.[32]  Forbes is a frequent panelist on the television program Forbes on Fox, which also features members of the Forbes magazine staff and is shown Saturday mornings on Fox News Channel at 11:00 am EST.\nOn March 28, 2007, Forbes joined Rudy Giuliani's campaign for the 2008 presidential election, serving as a National Co-Chair and Senior Policy Advisor. Later in the 2008 presidential campaign, Forbes served as John McCain's economic adviser on taxes, energy and the budget during McCain's bid for the 2008 presidential election.[33]\nIn March 2013, Forbes participated in an NPR broadcast Intelligence Squared debate with James Grant, Frederic Mishkin and John\u00a0R. Taylor\u00a0Jr. concerning the motion \"Does America Need A Strong Dollar Policy?\".[34]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 1971, he married Sabina Beekman. They have five daughters, including Moira Forbes.[35] Forbes appeared alongside his family on Larry King Live during his 1996 presidential campaign.[36] Forbes has been a resident of Bedminster, New Jersey.[37]\nForbes rides Amtrak trains and was a passenger on board the 2016 Chester, Pennsylvania, train derailment.[38][39]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nForbes, Steve (1999).

He then began hosting Louder with Crowder, a daily political podcast and YouTube channel with commentary segments. It includes a recurring segment called \"Change My Mind\", in which Crowder invites passers-by to converse. In December 2012, Crowder and members of Americans for Prosperity were involved in an altercation at a demonstration in Michigan concerning the state's recently passed right-to-work law.[3]\nCrowder's YouTube channel has been demonetized twice, first in 2019 after repeated use of racist and homophobic slurs.[4][5][6][7] His channel was re-monetized after YouTube said Crowder addressed his behavior and content,[8] and it was demonetized again in March 2021, with uploads suspended for a week, after violating YouTube's presidential election integrity policy against advancing false claims about the election's integrity.[9] YouTube suspended the channel again for two weeks in October 2022 for violating its harassment, threats and cyberbullying policy.[10] The channel had 5.86 million subscribers as of May 2023.[11]  Crowder moved his show to Rumble in March 2023.[12]\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nCrowder was born on July 7, 1987, in Detroit, Michigan. He has an older brother named Jordan. His mother was French Canadian, and at the age of three, his family moved to the Montreal suburb of Greenfield Park, Quebec, Canada where he would live for the rest of his childhood.[13] Crowder attended Centennial Regional High School in Longueuil, and at the age of 18, he moved back to the United States.[14] Crowder attended two semesters at Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont.[15]\n\nCareer[edit]\nEarly career and Fox News[edit]\nAt age 12, he worked as a voice actor for the character Alan \"The Brain\" Powers on the children's television series Arthur.[16] He began performing stand-up comedy at age 17. He then acted in a number of films, including the role of Doug Moore in the 2009 movie To Save a Life. From 2009 to 2012, Crowder worked for Fox News.[15]\nBy 2009, Crowder regularly posted satirical videos on politically conservative media, including Pajamas Media[17] and later at Andrew Breitbart's Big Hollywood. Crowder served as the master of ceremonies at the 2011 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC),[18] and generated some controversy with a rap video he premiered at CPAC 2012.[19]\n\nDecember 2012 union protest[edit]\nCrowder speaking at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference\nAt a December 2012 protest, Crowder was punched repeatedly in the face by a union member who claimed he was acting in self defense after being pushed to the ground.[20][15]\nCrowder and members of Americans for Prosperity were at a demonstration in Michigan concerning the state's recently passed right-to-work law.[3] The incident began with an attempt by union activists to tear down the Americans for Prosperity tent, which was eventually successful. During the altercation, Crowder was punched several times by a union activist. Crowder posted an edited video of the incident to his YouTube channel that cut footage of the alleged assailant being pushed to the ground and getting back up, right before throwing the punches at Crowder. However, Fox News' broadcasts of the incident included footage of the man being pushed. The New York Times stated, \"The same footage also shows that Mr. Crowder had his hand on that man's shoulder just before he tumbled to the ground, but, while the camera does not capture the whole sequence of events, it seems likely that the man was knocked to the ground as members of the two sides pushed against one other, not shoved down by Mr. Crowder.\"[20] Crowder later released an unedited copy of the video.[21]\nAn AFL\u2013CIO spokesman, Eddie Vale, stated that the organization did not condone the tearing down of the Americans for Prosperity tent or the violence against Crowder and his group.[22]\nIn March 2013, Ingham County Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III declined to press charges against anyone involved in the December 2012 altercation. According to Dunnings, his office was originally sent an edited version of the video of Crowder's altercation. However, upon reviewing the unedited version, the prosecutor's office decided not to pursue the case because the union member had acted in self-defense.[23][15]\n\nLouder with Crowder[edit]\nCrowder hosting Louder with Crowder, 2019\nIn October 2013, Fox News ended its relationship with Crowder. This was announced shortly after Crowder made negative statements about Fox News host Sean Hannity and about Fox News.[15] In 2017, the Louder with Crowder program, featuring mainly comedic content and political commentary, became a daily program featured on Conservative Review's new streaming service, CRTV. On December 3, 2018, CRTV merged with Glenn Beck's TheBlaze,[24] where Crowder was hosted until December 2022,[citation needed] alongside his YouTube channel, which has existed since 2009.[15][25][26]\n\"Change My Mind\" is a regular segment conducted by Crowder in which he sits at a table with a sign including the phrase \"Change My Mind\" and invites people walking by, often students at a university campus, to change his mind on a controversial subject. A photograph of Crowder seated behind a sign in February 2018 reading \"Male Privilege is a Myth | Change My Mind\" outside the Texas Christian University campus became an Internet meme.[27][28][29] Variations of the meme often feature humorously controversial statements in place of \"Male Privilege is a Myth\", such as \"Pineapple goes on pizza | Change My Mind\".[30][31]\nFrancesca Tripodi, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said that Crowder is \"very popular, especially among young, conservative voters\".[26] Stanford researcher Becca Lewis told Bloomberg News that while Crowder does not directly express white nationalist views, his channel \"has some of the most overt racism of any of the shows I've looked at\".[26]  Crowder's channel faced similar criticism after he described CBS reporter Betty Yu's face as \"aggressively Asian\", with CBS and KPIX-TV condemning what they described as the \"horrific, racist comments\" and \"demeaning Asian stereotypes\" on his show.[32][33][34]\n\n\"America Is Superior [To Every Other Country], Change My Mind\"\nCrowder's show has also seen success on Apple's podcast list, having remained on the top 100 list over the course of 2020.[35] On YouTube, the Louder with Crowder podcast has 5.94 million subscribers and his secondary channel CrowderBits has approximately 1.21 million subscribers.[36][37]\n\nViolations of online policies[edit]\nIn June 2019, YouTube investigated Crowder for his use of racist and homophobic slurs towards Carlos Maza in multiple videos reacting to the Vox series Strikethrough, which Maza hosts. Crowder referred to Maza as \"Mr. Lispy queer\", an \"angry little queer\", and a \"gay Mexican\". Additionally, Crowder mocked Maza using a stereotypical voice, sometimes while wearing a t-shirt with Che Guevara on it that said \"Socialism is for f*gs [sic]\".[4] Moreover, Maza said that Crowder's fans had doxxed and harassed him.[38] Maza expressed disappointment that YouTube, which, as described by Maza, \"brands itself as being a queer space\", didn't provide more protection.[4] Vox Media's The Verge published an article stating that Crowder's videos \"routinely contain egregious violations of YouTube's policies against cyberbullying\".[39] Crowder responded with a video where he said his use of slurs was \"playful ribbing\" and that \"it's funny, it's a comedy show\". He said that the investigation was \"an example of a giant, multinational media conglomeration\u00a0... attempting to squash a competitor\". He also stated in regard to both his followers harassing Maza and to Vox's and Google's investigation of his channel that he is opposed to doxxing and harassment.[40][41]\nWhile YouTube acknowledged that Crowder's language was hurtful, it initially concluded that \"the videos as posted don't violate our policies\". It determined that Crowder had not encouraged his viewers to harass or dox Maza either on YouTube or other platforms and that the main point of his video was to respond to opinion.[42] The decision to not suspend the channel drew considerable criticism.[4] The next day, YouTube suspended the channel's monetization, describing the objectionable content as \"a pattern of egregious actions harmed the broader community\".[43] The reversal of the decision not to suspend the channel drew considerable criticism as well, including criticism from Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who had previously appeared on Crowder's show. Crowder responded to the reversal, stating on his Twitter account that, \"Vox is still going to be pissed\" because he was not removed from the platform.[44][45] In August 2020, YouTube re-monetized some of Crowder's content on the site, stating that Crowder's content had since become compliant with YouTube policy.[46]\nCrowder announced in February 2021 that he filed a lawsuit against Facebook, alleging he was unfairly censored by the platform.[47] The next month, YouTube suspended Crowder's channel for one week claiming that he violated the presidential election integrity policy by advancing false claims about the 2020 United States presidential election in Nevada and again indefinitely demonetized his account.[48] His account was then given a second strike on the platform for \"reveling in or mocking\" the killing of Ma'Khia Bryant in a video he posted, and Crowder responded by announcing that he had filed a lawsuit against YouTube seeking an injunction.[49]\nIn October 2022, Crowder's YouTube channel was suspended for two weeks for violating its policy on harassment, threats and cyberbullying. In response, Crowder stated that the suspension constituted election interference because his content is political in nature, he has a large viewership, and the timing of the suspension lasted through the November 8, 2022, midterm election day.[10] In May 2023, Crowder's channel was suspended again after having posted an episode of Louder with Crowder that featured Alex Jones as guest host, as it violated policies prohibiting videos created or hosted by personalities whose accounts have been terminated.[50]\n\nDispute with The Daily Wire[edit]\nIn January 2023, Crowder revealed on Louder with Crowder that he had received a term sheet from a conservative media outlet that he left unnamed. Crowder listed the offer's stipulations that, if he were to be demonetized or removed from platforms such as YouTube, Facebook or the iTunes Store, his payment would be cut substantially during that period. He criticized this as a symptom of right-wing media not fighting back against, but rather implicitly condoning, what he considered censorship by Big Tech, stating that \"Big Tech is in bed with Big Con\".[51]\nIt was later confirmed that the unnamed media outlet was The Daily Wire. Jeremy Boreing, the CEO of The Daily Wire, claimed Crowder had misrepresented the terms of the contract and that the contract would have paid Crowder $50 million over four years. Furthermore, Boreing asserted that the stipulation was necessary to ensure profitability.[52]\nOn March 3, 2023, Crowder announced on Russell Brand's show that he would be moving his show to Rumble.[12] In August 2023, Vanity Fair reported that the show's viewership on Rumble was declining following the dispute with Daily Wire as well as other controversies and lawsuits over sexual harassment. Crowder announced he was partnering with Alex Jones, as well as comedians Nick Di Paolo and Bryan Callen, to offer an expanded version of his Mug Club to be streamed via Rumble.[53]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nCrowder is a Christian. He married Hilary Korzon in August 2012 and wrote about what he considers the benefits of remaining abstinent before his marriage.[54]\nIn July 2021, Crowder underwent a surgical operation in which titanium bars were inserted into his chest in order to counteract his congenital condition of pectus excavatum (sunken chest).[36][55] The surgery caused fluid to accumulate in his lungs, which he called \"excruciatingly painful\". Several weeks later, he was rushed to the hospital due to a collapsed lung.[56]\nIn August 2021, his wife gave birth to twins, a son and a daughter.[57]\n\nAllegations of spousal abuse[edit]\nIn April 2023, Crowder stated on his channel that his wife Hilary had filed for divorce in 2021.[58][59] In the video, Crowder appeared to be upset that his wife was able to divorce him without his consent.[60][61] Shortly after Crowder's announcement, journalist Yashar Ali released a video he claimed was given to him by Hilary which shows Crowder berating Hilary while she was eight months pregnant. In the video, Crowder yelled at Hilary for failing to perform her \"wifely duties\" and told her to \"fucking watch it\" when Hilary accused Crowder of \"abuse\".[60]\nThe release of this footage contributed to a feud between Crowder and fellow conservative media presenters from the Daily Wire, most notably Candace Owens.[62]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nFilm\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1999\n\nThe Bone Collector\n\nExtra\n\n\n\n\n2000\u20132001\n\nArthur\n\nAlan 'The Brain' Powers\n\nVoice\n\n\n2000\n\nArthur's Perfect Christmas\n\n\n2001\n\nTwo Summers\n\nFriend\n\n\n\n\n2002\n\nSagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat\n\nMung\n\nVoice\n\n\n2005\n\n3 Needles\n\nDepanneur Manager\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\nThe Covenant\n\nParty Kid\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\nThe Secret\n\nClassroom Boy\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\nBend & Break\n\nBlake\n\n\n\n\nThe Velveteen Rabbit\n\nBaseball Boy #1\n\n\n\n\nGreek\n\nJace\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\nTo Save a Life\n\nDoug Moore\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"About StevenCrowder\".

It is named after the American lawyer and politician Henry L. Stimson.\nStimson analyzes issues such as nuclear proliferation, arms trafficking, water management, wildlife poaching, and responses to humanitarian crises. It also provides consulting for US and international institutions and publishes articles for the general public.[2]\nIn 2013, Stimson received the MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions.[3] Stimson was ranked 10th best U.S. think tank in the University of Pennsylvania's 2020 Global Go To Think Tanks Report.[4]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe Stimson Center was founded in 1989 by Barry Blechman and Michael Krepon.[5][6] It is currently led by Chairman of the Board Herbert \"Hawk\" Carlisle and President and CEO Brian Finlay.[7][8]\nThe center is funded by research contracts, grants from foundations and other donations. It publicly discloses funding sources on an annual basis.[9]\n\nPrograms and Areas of Research[edit]\nThe Stimson Center conducts research, engagement, and solutions building across five thematic areas: Trade and Technology, Security and Strategy, Human Security and Governance, Climate and Natural Resources, and Pivotal Places, a geographic topic that largely covers work on Asia and the Indo-Pacific.[10]\nThe organization has about twenty different policy programs,[11] including:\n\n38 North[edit]\nMain article: 38 North\nThe 38 North program cultivates public policy debate about North Korea, emphasizing hands-on experience and expertise with the authoritative 38north.org web journal, in-depth research on issues central to North Korean strategic thinking, and informal diplomatic engagement. Other major projects include North Korea's Economy: A Glimpse Through Imagery, a commercial satellite imagery analysis series focused on the North Korean economy in partnership with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the DPRK Digital Atlas, a comprehensive geospatial dataset based on open source data of DPRK political, economic, cultural and security infrastructure.\n\nEast Asia[edit]\nThe East Asia program conducts research on regional security issues and offers recommendations for policymakers in the U.S. and in the region on a variety of issues.[12] The program analyzes the dynamics of cross-Strait relations, including the exchange of ideas and people between the U.S. and Asia-Pacific region. The program also examines China's foreign relations toward Northeast and Southeast Asia, with a special focus on Myanmar, Iran, and Africa, and addresses U.S.\u2013Japan alliance relations and developments on the Korean Peninsula.[13][14]\n\nEnvironmental Security[edit]\nThe Environmental Security program explores how increased stress on global ecosystems and shared natural resources may compromise economic development, fuel social conflict, and undermine political stability in key areas throughout the world.[15]\n\nMiddle East[edit]\nThe Middle East program explores issues that affect regional security from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. They study cross-border dynamics in the region, and are focused on the rising threat from sectarianism and its roots in radical Islamic ideology.[16] The program's Gulf Security work analyzes traditional and nontraditional security issues impacting the Gulf States and their neighbors.[17] In 2015, the program is monitoring the regional security repercussions of the Iran nuclear negotiations.\n\nSouth Asia[edit]\nThe South Asia program seeks to reduce nuclear dangers in South Asia by focusing on risks associated with the accelerating arms competition between India and Pakistan.[18] These risks are amplified by the activities of terrorist groups and political instability in the region. The program has championed confidence-building and nuclear risk-reduction measures in South Asia for over twenty years. The South Asia program analyzes U.S. crisis management on the subcontinent, producing case studies of the \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d and Mumbai crises, and identifying future challenges. The program seeks to empower an emerging generation of strategic analysts in South Asia by means of the South Asian Voices website, conferences, and visiting fellowships.[19]\n\nSoutheast Asia[edit]\nBrian Eyler is the Director of the Stimson Center's Southeast Asia program, and is regarded as an expert on transboundary issues in the Mekong region and China's economic relationship with Southeast Asia.[20]\nThe Southeast Asia program[21] addresses major challenges facing the region today, ranging from the food-water-energy security nexus in the Mekong Basin to political and economic issues of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) integration. The main focus of the program's research is development in the Greater Mekong Subregion, particularly hydroelectric power projects and their impacts on the food-water-security nexus and regional stability. The program also regularly addresses trade, economic, and political issues involving ASEAN member states, U.S.\u2013ASEAN relations and policy issues, and maritime security issues in the South China Sea, particularly territorial disputes and fishery management.\n\nPublications[edit]\nThis article needs to be updated.
