    "wiki": "American pundit and author\n\n\nPeggy NoonanNoonan in 2016BornMargaret Ellen Noonan (1950-09-07) September 7, 1950 (age\u00a073)New York City, New York, U.S.EducationFairleigh Dickinson University (BA)OccupationsPolitical commentatorpolitical speechwriterPolitical partyRepublican\nMargaret Ellen Noonan (born September 7, 1950), known as Peggy Noonan, is a weekly columnist for The Wall Street Journal, and contributor to NBC News and ABC News. She was a primary speechwriter and Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan from 1984 to 1986 and has maintained a center-right leaning in her writings since leaving the Reagan administration. Five of Noonan's books have been New York Times bestsellers.\nNoonan was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on America: A Tribute to Heroes.\n\n\nEarly life and early career[edit]\nNoonan was born on September 7, 1950, in Brooklyn, New York,[1][2] the daughter of a merchant seaman. She is of Irish descent.[3] Noonan is a graduate of Rutherford High School in Rutherford, New Jersey, and Fairleigh Dickinson University.[4]\nNoonan worked as the daily CBS Radio commentary writer for anchorman Dan Rather at CBS News, whom she once called \"the best boss I ever had.\" From 1975 through 1977 she worked the overnight shift as a newswriter at WEEI Radio in Boston, where she was later Editorial and Public Affairs Director.\nIn 1978 and 1979 she was an adjunct professor of journalism at New York University.[5]\n\nSpeechwriting[edit]\nNoonan in 1986\nNoonan meeting with President Ronald Reagan in 1988\nIn 1984, Noonan, as a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, authored his \"Boys of Pointe du Hoc\" speech on the 40th anniversary of D-Day. She also wrote Reagan's address to the nation after the Challenger explosion, drawing upon the poet John Magee's words about aviators who \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\u00a0... and touched the face of God.\" The latter is ranked as the eighth best American political speech of the 20th century, according to a list compiled by professors at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and Texas A&M University. The \"Pointe du Hoc\" speech ranks as the 58th best speech of the century, according to the website American Rhetoric.[6]\nShe also worked on a tribute Reagan gave to honor President John F. Kennedy at a fundraising event held at the McLean, Virginia, home of Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the spring of 1984.\nLater, while working for then Vice President George H.\u00a0W. Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, Noonan coined the phrase \"a kinder, gentler nation\" and also popularized \"a thousand points of light\", two memorable catchphrases used by Bush. Noonan also wrote Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans, in which he pledged: \"Read my lips: no new taxes\". Bush's subsequent reversal of this pledge is often cited as a major reason for his defeat in his 1992 re-election campaign.\nIn 1995, Noonan received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edmund Morris.[7]\n\nLater career[edit]\nNoonan worked as a consultant on the American television drama The West Wing.\nIn 2003, Noonan was a supporter of the US invasion of Iraq.[8]\nIn mid-August 2004, Noonan took a brief unpaid leave from The Wall Street Journal to campaign for George W. Bush's reelection.\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, Noonan wrote about Sarah Palin's vice presidential candidacy in The Wall Street Journal. In one opinion piece, Noonan expressed her view that Palin did not demonstrate \"the tools, the equipment, the knowledge or the philosophical grounding one hopes for, and expects, in a holder of high office,\" concluding that Palin's candidacy marked a \"vulgarization in American Politics\" that is \"no good... for conservatism... [or] the country.\"[9] Such commentary resulted in a backlash from many conservatives.[10]\nIn July 2022, in a column about the rise of remote work and empty office buildings, she wrote, \"I don\u2019t want America to look like an Edward Hopper painting. He was the great artist of American loneliness\u2014empty streets, tables for one, everyone at the bar drinking alone. We weren\u2019t meant to be a Hopper painting. We were meant to be and work together.\"[11]\nNoonan is an author, a columnist for The Wall Street Journal, and a commentator on several news shows, including CNN, where she distanced herself from more conservative Republicans and Donald Trump's presidency. She was one of the founding members of wowOwow.com, along with Liz Smith, Lesley Stahl, Mary Wells Lawrence, and Joni Evans.\nIn 2017, Noonan won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary, for \"rising to the moment with beautifully rendered columns that connected readers to the shared virtues of Americans during one of the nation's most divisive political campaigns.\"[12]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 1985, Noonan married Richard W. Rahn, who was then chief economist at the US Chamber of Commerce. Their son Will was born in 1987.[13]\nNoonan and her husband were divorced after five years of marriage. In 1989 she returned with her son to her native New York. In 2004, according to an interview with Crisis Magazine, she lived in a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights with her son, who attended the nearby Saint Ann's School.[14]\nNoonan lives in New York City.[15] She is a practicing Roman Catholic[16] and attends St. Thomas More Church on Manhattan's Upper East Side.[17]\n\nCriticism[edit]\nWhile Noonan's speechwriting has been praised, her books and Wall Street Journal columns have been the source of criticism and mockery. Critics have singled out her reliance on personal anecdotes to make broad assertions about current events and changes in American politics and society.[18]\nDuring Hurricane Katrina, she called for looters in New Orleans to be shot.[19] Henry Giroux called it a \"barely coded rationale to shoot low-income Black people.\"[19]\nNate Silver wrote asking Noonan to present evidence concerning her charge that the IRS was auditing taxpayers for political reasons.[20]\nIn a March 2013 column, she used her experience staying at a short-staffed airport hotel to demonstrate the Obama administration's lack of focus on job creation and infrastructure spending, even though infrastructure was a significant component of Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which Noonan had previously criticized in November 2010.[21][22] \nIn August 2019, Noonan was mocked for writing a column on Donald Trump's support among Hispanic Americans which centered on a conversation she had with a Dominican friend who worked at the deli counter at her grocery store.[23][24][25][26][27] In June 2019, Noonan wrote a column about the loyalty of Trump's supporters that was based on conversations she had with her sister and her uncle.[28]\nRecurring themes in Noonan's books and columns include the decline of civility, social graces, religiosity, patriotism, bipartisanship and statesmanship in contemporary American politics and society, as well as enduring praise for past conservative political figures such as Ronald Reagan and George H.\u00a0W. Bush. As a result, her writing is criticized for being overly nostalgic.[29]\nIn June 2019, after Noonan called on congressional Democrats to censure President Trump in the wake of the Mueller report, he attacked her on Twitter, calling her \"simplistic\" and claiming that she \"is stuck in the past glory of Reagan.\"[30][31] In June 2022, Trump issued a statement calling Noonan a \"weak and frail RINO [Republican In Name Only]\u00a0... who did much less for Ronald Reagan than she claims, and who actually said bad things about him and his ability to speak\" after she wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the Republican Party was \"rejecting\" Trump in the aftermath of the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[32]\n\nBooks[edit]\nExternal videos Booknotes interview with Noonan on What I Saw at the Revolution, February 18, 1990, C-SPAN Presentation by Noonan on Simply Speaking, February 19, 1998, C-SPAN Presentation by Noonan on The Case Against Hillary Clinton, April 3, 2000, C-SPAN Washington Journal interview with Noonan on Patriotic Grace, October 6, 2008, C-SPAN Presentation by Noonan on The Time of Our Lives, November 25, 2015, C-SPAN Interview with Noonan on The Time of Our Lives, November 21, 2015, C-SPAN\n1990: What I Saw at the Revolution: A Political Life in the Reagan Era (ISBN\u00a00-8129-6989-8)\n1994: Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness (ISBN\u00a01-55850-509-1)\n1998: Simply Speaking: How to Communicate Your Ideas With Style, Substance, and Clarity (ISBN\u00a00-7881-6775-8)\n1999: On Speaking Well (ISBN\u00a00-06-098740-5) (a paperback edition of \"Simply Speaking\")\n1999: Character Above All (ISBN\u00a00-684-82709-3) (one chapter in an anthology)\n2000: The Case Against Hillary Clinton (ISBN\u00a00-06-039340-8)\n2001: When Character Was King: A Story of Ronald Reagan (ISBN\u00a00-14-200168-6)\n2003: A Heart, A Cross And A Flag (ISBN\u00a00-7432-5005-2)\n2005: John Paul The Great: Remembering a Spiritual Father (ISBN\u00a00-670-03748-6)\n2008: Patriotic Grace: What It Is and Why We Need It Now (ISBN\u00a0978-0-06-173582-0)\n2015: The Time of Our Lives: Collected Writings (ISBN\u00a0978-1-45-556313-5)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Bothmer, Bernard von (2007).

Born in Boston,[1] he was a non-tenure track assistant professor of philosophy at Portland State University for ten years, and his areas of academic focus include atheism, critical thinking, pedagogy, scientific skepticism, and the Socratic method.[2][3] He is the author of A Manual for Creating Atheists, and (with James Lindsay) of How to Have Impossible Conversations: A Very Practical Guide.\nBoghossian was involved in the grievance studies affair (also called \"Sokal Squared\" in media coverage) with collaborators James A. Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose, which entailed submitting bogus papers to peer-reviewed publications related to gender studies and other fields.[4] This project generated significant media and academic attention, including both praise and condemnation, as well as ethical and methodological criticism. After an investigation, Portland State University restricted Boghossian's future work on the basis of research misconduct. In September 2021, Boghossian resigned his position from Portland State University, citing harassment and a lack of intellectual freedom.[5]\nBoghossian coined the term street epistemology for a set of conversational techniques he described, which are designed to enable examination of strongly held beliefs, especially of the religious kind, in a non-confrontational manner.\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nBoghossian's primary interests are critical thinking, philosophy of education, and moral reasoning. His thesis looked at the use of the Socratic method with prison inmates for critical thinking and moral reasoning with the intention of decreasing ongoing criminal behavior.[6] The research was funded by the State of Oregon. Boghossian was Chairman of the Prison Advisory Committee for the Columbia River Correctional Institution. He is a fellow at the Center for Prison Reform.[7] He was employed as an assistant professor at Portland State University, quitting in protest due to what he viewed as a culture of illiberalism.[8][9]\nBoghossian is the author of two books, A Manual for Creating Atheists (2013),[10] a book with a foreword by Michael Shermer,[11] and How to Have Impossible Conversations: A Very Practical Guide (2019).[12] He also contributed a foreword to white supremacist[13] commentator Stefan Molyneux's book Against the Gods.[14][15] He has characteized his collaborations with Molyneux as being based only on his agreement on matters of metaphysics, and not with Molyneux's political views.[15]\nIn 2017, Boghossian was featured in Reasons To Believe, a documentary focusing on psychology and the science of belief.[16]\nHe has been a speaker for the Center for Inquiry, the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, and the Secular Student Alliance.[17]\nIn September 2021, Boghossian resigned his position from Portland State University.[5] In his resignation letter,[18] he called the university a \"Social Justice factory\" and said that he faced harassment and retaliation for speaking out.[5] The letter also accuses the university of creating a culture where students are \"afraid to speak openly and honestly,\" of training students to \"mimic the moral certainty of ideologues,\" and of \"[driving] intolerance of divergent beliefs and opinions\".[18]\nIn November 2021, Boghossian was among the founders of the University of Austin, a school whose mission is \"to create a 'fiercely independent' school that offers an alternative to what founders see as a rise in \u201cilliberalism\u201d on college campuses.\"[19]\nOn February 17, 2022, he gave a conference on \"wokism\" at the Mathias Corvinus Collegium (MCC) in Budapest, Hungary.[20]\n\nViews[edit]\nBoghossian at The Amazing Meeting in 2013\nBoghossian has called all faith-based beliefs \"delusions\".[21] He has been described by The Daily Beast as aligned with the New Atheist movement.[11] He advocates using the Socratic method to dissuade religious believers, though he recommends focusing on criticism of faith as a way of knowing (he calls it an \"unreliable epistemology\"), rather than the outward trappings of religious communities.[11]\nIn a 2015 interview with Dave Rubin, Boghossian described himself as a classical liberal who has never voted for a Republican candidate, but is \"not a fan\" of the Democrats. He stated that any of the Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential election \"would be an unmitigated disaster\".[22] He donated to and endorsed Andrew Yang for the 2020 United States presidential election.[23] He has stated that the US Republican Party is \"the most powerful, anti-science political movement in the world\". He wrote that it was \"not alarmist\" to state that they \"could destroy the world\" since many \"refuse to even acknowledge that climate change is happening\", and stated that their \"denialist attitude is due partly to the religious convictions\".[24]\nAccording to Boghossian, \"the regressive left have taken over academia\".[22] He has often stated that cultural relativism and egalitarianism are contradictory values.[22][25][26]\n\nGrievance studies affair[edit]\nMain article: Grievance studies affair\nSee also: List of scholarly publishing stings \u00a7\u00a0Interdisciplinary and cultural studies\nIn the grievance studies affair, also referred to as the \"Sokal Squared\" scandal, Boghossian, James A. Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose submitted a series of hoax academic papers for peer-review to journals in academic fields which they termed \"grievance studies\"\u2014race, gender, feminist and sexuality studies which they believed were characterized by low scientific standards. They prepared 20 papers, of which 7 were accepted by the time the Wall Street Journal called their bluff.[27][28][29]\n\nPrevious hoax paper[edit]\nIn 2017, Boghossian and Lindsay published a hoax paper titled \"The Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct\".[30] The paper, which the authors said was intentionally absurd and written in a way that imitated the style of \"poststructuralist discursive gender theory\", argued that the penis should be seen \"not as an anatomical organ but as a social construct isomorphic to performative toxic masculinity\".[30][31] Boghossian and Lindsay initially submitted the paper to Norma, where it was rejected.[32][33] They later submitted the paper to Cogent Social Sciences, an open access journal which has been criticized as a pay-to-publish operation.[30] The authors later revealed the hoax in Skeptic magazine. Boghossian and Lindsay stated that they intended to demonstrate that \"gender studies is crippled academically by an overriding almost-religious belief that maleness is the root of all evil\", and also to highlight problems with the review processes of open-access journals.\nA number of critics questioned whether Boghossian and Lindsay's paper demonstrated a problem in the field of gender studies.[31] Alan Sokal, a mathematics professor who was responsible for a similar hoax in 1996, noted that Cogent Social Sciences was a low-tiered open access journal that did not specialize in gender studies, and said that it seemed unlikely the paper would have been accepted at a mainstream gender studies journal.[34] While the journal did conduct a postmortem, Boghossian and Lindsay concluded the \"impact [of the hoax] was very limited, and much criticism of it was legitimate\".[35]\n\nSequence of events[edit]\nBeginning in August 2017, Boghossian, Lindsay, and Pluckrose began a much larger attempt in which they wrote 20 hoax papers, submitting them to peer-reviewed journals under a variety of pseudonyms as well as the name of Richard Baldwin, a professor emeritus at Florida's Gulf Coast State College and friend of Boghossian. The project was halted early after one of the papers in the feminist geography journal Gender, Place & Culture was criticized on social media, and then its authenticity questioned on Campus Reform.[36]\nAfter this, the trio revealed the full extent of their work in a YouTube video created and released by documentary filmmaker Mike Nayna, alongside an investigation by The Wall Street Journal.[37][38] By the time of the revelation seven of their twenty papers had been accepted, seven were still under review, and six had been rejected. One paper, which was accepted by feminist social work journal Affilia, transposed up-to-date jargon into passages lifted from Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.[39]\nTom Whipple of The Times wrote that academic reviewers had praised the studies prior to the revelation of the hoax as \"a rich and exciting contribution to the study of ... the intersection between masculinity and anality\", \"excellent and very timely\", and \"important dialogue for social workers and feminist scholars\".[40]\n\nReactions[edit]\nThe project drew both praise and criticism, with author Yascha Mounk dubbing it 'Sokal squared' in reference to the Sokal Affair hoax perpetrated by Alan Sokal and saying \"The result is hilarious and delightful. It also showcases a serious problem with big parts of academia.\" Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker said the project posed the question \"is there any idea so outlandish that it won't be published in a Critical/PoMo/Identity/'Theory' journal?\"[41] Daniel Engber of online magazine Slate criticised the project, saying \"one could have run this sting on almost any empirical discipline and returned the same result\".[42] In an open letter, eleven of Boghossian's colleagues at Portland State University wrote that the hoaxes \"violat[ed] acceptable norms of research,\" and were \"fraudulent, time-wasting, anti-intellectual activities\".[43][44] Joel P. Christensen and Matthew A. Sears said it was \"the academic equivalent of the fraudulent hit pieces on Planned Parenthood\" produced in 2015.[14] Carl Bergstrom claimed \"the hoaxers appear woefully na\u00efve about how the [peer review] system actually works\".[45]\nA 2021 study assessing the grievance studies affair concluded, (1) journals with higher impact factors were more likely to reject papers submitted as part of the project; (2) the chances were better, if the manuscript was allegedly based on empirical data; (3) peer reviews can be an important asset in the process of revising a manuscript; and (4) when the project authors, with academic education from neighboring disciplines, closely followed the reviewers' advice, they were able to learn relatively quickly what is needed for writing an acceptable article. The boundary between a seriously written paper and a \"hoax\" gradually became blurred. Finally (5), the way the project ended showed that in the long run, the scientific community will uncover fraudulent practices.\"[46]\n\nResearch misconduct investigation[edit]\nIn 2018, Boghossian's employer, Portland State University, initiated a research misconduct inquiry relating to the grievance studies affair. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the university's institutional review board (IRB) concluded that Boghossian violated the ethical guidelines by conducting research on human subjects without approval. The University also said it is \"considering a further charge that he had falsified data\".[47]\nAfter news of the research conduct investigation broke, a number of prominent academics wrote letters defending Boghossian, including evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, mathematician and physicist Alan Sokal, philosopher Daniel Dennett, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, and psychologist Jordan Peterson.[48] Pinker wrote that Portland State University's investigation struck him and his colleagues \"as an attempt to weaponize an important [principle] of academic ethics in order to punish a scholar for expressing an unpopular opinion\".[49] Dawkins suggested that the investigation could be politically motivated: \"If the members of your committee of inquiry object to the very idea of satire as a form of creative expression, they should come out honestly and say so. But to pretend that this is a matter of publishing false data is so obviously ridiculous that one cannot help suspecting an ulterior motive.\"[47] Peterson said that those pursuing allegations against Boghossian, and not Boghossian himself, were guilty of academic misconduct.[49]\nOn the other hand, IRB experts interviewed by Jesse Singal for New York magazine agreed that Boghossian should have sought IRB approval for the study.[50]\nIn December 2018, Portland State University ruled that Boghossian had \"violated ethical guidelines on human-subjects research\". Consequently, he was banned from doing research until he had \"completed training and could demonstrate that he understood how to protect the rights of human subjects\".[51]\n\nStreet epistemology[edit]\nAnthony Magnabosco speaks about street epistemology for American Atheists in 2011.\nStreet epistemology (often abbreviated to SE) is a term coined by Boghossian in his book A Manual for Creating Atheists.[52] This is a set of non-confrontational conversational techniques for discussing a strongly-held belief, designed to promote thoughtful reflection and open-mindedness in a participant regarding the belief. Boghossian outlined the method and its application in helping religious believers to reflect on the reliability of faith as an epistemology. However, it has also been found effective in many other contexts, and Boghossian later co-authored with James Lindsay How to Have Impossible Conversations, which describes the application of street epistemology to an examination of a wider range of beliefs including nonreligious ones.[12]\nOne popularizer of street epistemology is Anthony Magnabosco, who has uploaded many examples of SE conversations he has had to his YouTube channel. He has created many other resources surrounding the topic, and engages with a community of street epistemologists looking to become proficient in the method and apply it in their lives.[53] Magnabosco is the founder of Street Epistemology International, a non-profit organization \"whose mission is to encourage and normalize critical thinking and skepticism while providing people around the world with the resources needed to develop and promote street epistemology\".[54][55] Resources are available for the community of SE practitioners, which include a guide on how to perform interviews using the style.[55]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nThesis[edit]\nSocratic pedagogy, critical thinking, moral reasoning and inmate education: an exploratory study (Ed.D. thesis).

In 2005, he launched Founders Fund with PayPal partners Ken Howery and Luke Nosek. Earlier, Thiel became Facebook's first outside investor when he acquired a 10.2% stake for $500,000 in August 2004. He sold the majority of his shares in Facebook for over $1 billion in 2012 but remains on the board of directors.[7] After the Fifth National Government intervened on his behalf, Thiel was controversially granted New Zealand citizenship in 2011 after spending 12 days in the country non-consecutively. He co-founded Valar Ventures in 2010; co-founded Mithril Capital, serving as investment committee chair, in 2012; and served as a part-time partner at Y Combinator from 2015 to 2017.[8][9][10][11]\nThrough the Thiel Foundation, Thiel governs the grant-making bodies Breakout Labs and Thiel Fellowship, and funds non-profit research into artificial intelligence, life extension, and seasteading. In 2016, Thiel confirmed that he had funded Hulk Hogan in the Bollea v. Gawker lawsuit because Gawker had previously outed Thiel as gay. The lawsuit eventually bankrupted Gawker[12] and led to founder Nick Denton declaring bankruptcy.[13] Thiel is a conservative libertarian who has made substantial donations to American right-wing figures and causes. \n\n\nEarly life and education\nThiel was born in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany, on 11 October 1967, to Klaus Friedrich Thiel and his wife Susanne Thiel.[14][15] The family migrated to the United States when Peter was one year old and lived in Cleveland, Ohio, where his father worked as a chemical engineer.[16] Klaus then worked for various mining companies, creating an itinerant upbringing for Thiel and his younger brother, Patrick Michael Thiel.[17] Thiel's mother became a U.S. citizen, but his father did not.[15]\nBefore settling in Foster City, California, in 1977, the Thiels lived in South Africa and South West Africa (modern-day Namibia). Peter changed elementary schools seven times. He attended a strict establishment in Swakopmund that required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment, such as striking students' hands with a ruler. This experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in his support for individualism and libertarianism.[18][19]\nThiel played Dungeons & Dragons, was an avid reader of science fiction, with Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein among his favorite authors, and a fan of J. R. R. Tolkien's works, stating as an adult that he had read The Lord of the Rings over ten times.[20] Six firms (Palantir Technologies, Valar Ventures, Mithril Capital, Lembas LLC, Rivendell LLC and Arda Capital) that he founded adopted names originating from Tolkien.[21]\nThiel excelled in mathematics and scored first in a California-wide mathematics competition while attending Bowditch Middle School in Foster City.[22] At San Mateo High School, he read Ayn Rand, admired the optimism and anti-communism of then-President Ronald Reagan, and became valedictorian of his graduating class in 1985.[22][23]\nHe studied philosophy at Stanford University. During that time, debates on identity politics and political correctness were ongoing. A \"Western Culture\" program, which was criticized by The Rainbow Agenda because of a perceived over-representation of the achievements of European men, was replaced with a \"Culture, Ideas and Values\" course, which instead pushed diversity and multiculturalism. This replacement provoked controversy on the campus and led to Thiel co-founding The Stanford Review, a conservative and libertarian newspaper, in 1987 with funding from Irving Kristol.[24] Thiel served as The Stanford Review's first editor-in-chief and remained in that post until completing his Bachelor of Arts in 1989.[25] Over the years, Thiel has continued that relationship, consulting with the top editorial staff several times a year, hosting events at his house, donating to the newspaper and placing graduating students in internships or jobs within his network.[26]\nThiel enrolled in Stanford Law School and earned his Juris Doctor degree in 1992.[27]\nWhile at Stanford, Thiel met Ren\u00e9 Girard, whose mimetic theory influenced him.[28] Mimetic theory posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: \"It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world,\" but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: \"rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another.\"[29] Thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures, stating: \"The big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us, and while we get better at the things we're competing on, we lose sight of anything that's important, or transcendent, or truly meaningful in our world.\"[30][31]\n\nCareer\nEarly career\nAfter graduating from Stanford Law School, Thiel clerked for Judge James Larry Edmondson of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.[32] Thiel then worked as a securities lawyer for Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.  He left the law firm after seven months and three days, citing a lack of transcendental value in his work.[33] He then took a job as a derivatives trader in currency options at Credit Suisse. He joined them in 1993 while also working as a speechwriter for former United States Secretary of Education William Bennett, before returning to California in 1996 to seek a more meaningful occupation.[34]\nUpon returning to the Bay Area, Thiel noticed that the development of the internet and personal computer had launched the dot-com boom. With financial support from friends and family, he raised $1 million toward the establishment of Thiel Capital Management and embarked on his venture capital career. Early on, he experienced a setback after investing $100,000 in his friend Luke Nosek's unsuccessful web-based calendar project. Soon thereafter, Nosek's friend Max Levchin described to Thiel his cryptography-related company idea, which became their first venture called Fieldlink (later renamed Confinity) in 1998.[35][36]\n\nPayPal\nFurther information: PayPal \u00a7\u00a0Early history\nWith Confinity, Thiel realized they could develop software to bridge a gap in making online payments. Although the use of credit cards and expanding automated teller machine networks provided consumers with more payment options, not all merchants had the necessary hardware to accept credit cards. Thus, consumers had to pay with exact cash or check. Thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet for consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices, and in 1999 Confinity launched PayPal.[37]\nPayPal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money. Thiel viewed PayPal's mission as liberating people from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation. Thiel spoke in 1999:\n\nWe're definitely onto something big. The need PayPal answers is monumental. Everyone in the world needs money\u2014to get paid, to trade, to live. Paper money is an ancient technology and an inconvenient means of payment. You can run out of it. It wears out. It can get lost or stolen. In the twenty-first century, people need a form of money that's more convenient and secure, something that can be accessed from anywhere with a PDA or an Internet connection. Of course, what we're calling 'convenient' for American users will be revolutionary for the developing world. Many of these countries' governments play fast and loose with their currencies. They use inflation and sometimes wholesale currency devaluations, like we saw in Russia and several Southeast Asian countries last year [referring to the 1998 Russian and 1997 Asian financial crisis], to take wealth away from their citizens. Most of the ordinary people there never have an opportunity to open an offshore account or to get their hands on more than a few bills of a stable currency like U.S. dollars. Eventually PayPal will be able to change this. In the future, when we make our service available outside the U.S. and as Internet penetration continues to expand to all economic tiers of people, PayPal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before. It will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or Pounds or Yen, in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure.[38]\nWhen PayPal launched at a press conference in 1999, representatives from Nokia and Deutsche Bank sent $3 million in venture funding to Thiel using PayPal on their PalmPilots. PayPal then continued to grow through mergers in 2000 with Elon Musk's online financial services company X.com, and with Pixo, a company specializing in mobile commerce. These mergers allowed PayPal to expand into the wireless phone market and transformed it into a safer and more user-friendly tool by enabling users to transfer money via a free online registration and email rather than by exchanging bank account information.\nPayPal went public on 15 February 2002 and was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October of that year.[39] Thiel remained CEO of the company until the sale.[5] His 3.7% stake in the company was worth $55 million at the time of acquisition.[40]  In Silicon Valley circles, Thiel is colloquially referred to as the \"Don of the PayPal Mafia\".[41]\n\nClarium Capital\nFurther information: Clarium Capital\nThiel used $10 million of his proceeds to create Clarium Capital Management, a global macro hedge fund focusing on directional and liquid instruments in currencies, interest rates, commodities, and equities.[42] Thiel stated that \"the big, macroeconomic idea that we had at Clarium\u2014the id\u00e9e fixe\u2014was the peak-oil theory, which was basically that the world was running out of oil, and that there were no easy alternatives.\"[22]\nIn 2003, Thiel successfully bet that the United States dollar would weaken.[43] In 2004, Thiel spoke of the dot-com bubble having migrated, in effect, into a growing bubble in the financial sector, and specified General Electric and Walmart as vulnerable. In 2005, Clarium saw a 57.1% return as Thiel predicted that the dollar would rally.[44][43]\nHowever, Clarium faltered in 2006 with a 7.8% loss. Thereafter, the firm sought to profit in the long-term from its petrodollar analysis, which foresaw the impending decline in oil supplies.[45] Clarium's assets under management grew after achieving a 40.3% return in 2007 to more than $7 billion by the first quarter of 2008, but fell later in the year and again in 2009 after financial markets collapsed.[46][47] By 2011, after missing out on the economic rebound, many key investors pulled out, reducing the value of Clarium's assets to $350 million, two thirds of which was Thiel's money.[48]\n\nPalantir\nFurther information: Palantir Technologies\nIn May 2003, Thiel incorporated Palantir Technologies, a big data analysis company named after the Tolkien artifact.[49] He continues to serve as its chairman as of 2022.[50][51] Thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that \"the approaches that PayPal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts, like fighting terrorism\". He also stated that, after the September 11 attacks, the debate in the United States was \"will we have more security with less privacy or less security with more privacy?\". He envisioned Palantir as providing data mining services to government intelligence agencies that were maximally unintrusive and traceable.[52][53]\nPalantir's first backer was the Central Intelligence Agency's venture capital arm In-Q-Tel. The company steadily grew and in 2015 was valued at $20 billion, with Thiel being the company's largest shareholder.[54][55]\n\nFacebook\nFurther information: Facebook \u00a7\u00a0Thefacebook, Thiel investment, and name change\nIn August 2004, Thiel made a $500,000 angel investment in Facebook for a 10.2% stake in the company and joined Facebook's board. This was the first outside investment in Facebook and valued the company at $4.9 million.[56][57] As a board member, Thiel was not actively involved in Facebook's operations. He provided help with timing the various rounds of funding and Zuckerberg credited Thiel with helping him time Facebook's 2007 Series D, which closed before the 2008 financial crisis.[58]\nIn his book The Facebook Effect, David Kirkpatrick outlines how Thiel came to make this investment: Napster co-founder Sean Parker, who at the time had assumed the title of \"President\" of Facebook, was seeking investors. Parker approached Reid Hoffman, the CEO of work-based social network LinkedIn. Hoffman liked Facebook but declined to become lead investor because of the potential for conflict of interest. Hoffman directed Parker to Thiel, whom he knew from their PayPal days. Thiel met Parker and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Thiel and Zuckerberg got along well, and Thiel agreed to lead Facebook's seed round with $500,000 for 10.2% of the company. The investment was originally in the form of a convertible note, to be converted to equity if Facebook reached 1.5 million users by the end of 2004. Although Facebook narrowly missed the target, Thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway.[59] Thiel said of his investment:\n\nI was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision. And it was a very reasonable valuation. I thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment.[59]\nIn September 2010, Thiel, while expressing skepticism about the potential for growth in the consumer Internet sector, argued that relative to other Internet companies, Facebook (which then had a secondary market valuation of $30 billion) was comparatively undervalued.[60]\nFacebook's initial public offering was in May 2012, with a market cap of nearly $100 billion ($38 a share), at which time Thiel sold 16.8 million shares for $638 million.[61] In August 2012, immediately upon the conclusion of the early investor lock-up period, Thiel sold almost all of his remaining stake for between $19.27 and $20.69 per share, or $395.8 million, for a total of more than $1 billion.[62] He retained his seat on the board of directors.[63] In 2016, he sold a little under 1 million of his shares for around $100 million. In November 2017, he sold another 160,805 shares for $29 million, putting his holdings in Facebook at 59,913 Class A shares.[64] As of April 2020, he owned less than 10,000 shares in Facebook.[65]\nOn 7 February 2022, Thiel announced he would not stand for re-election to the board of Facebook owner Meta at the 2022 annual stockholders' meeting and would leave after serving 17 years in order to support pro Donald Trump candidates in the 2022 United States elections.[51][66]\n\nFounders Fund\nFurther information: Founders Fund\nIn 2005, Thiel created Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based venture capital fund.[67] Other partners in the fund include Sean Parker, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek.[68]\nIn addition to Facebook, Thiel made early-stage investments in numerous startups (personally or through Founders Fund), including Airbnb,[22] Slide.com,[69] LinkedIn,[22] Friendster,[70] RapLeaf, Geni.com, Yammer, Yelp Inc., Spotify,[22] Powerset, Practice Fusion, MetaMed, Vator, SpaceX,[22] Palantir Technologies, IronPort, Votizen, Asana, Big Think, CapLinked, Quora, Nanotronics Imaging, Rypple, TransferWise, Stripe, Block.one,[71] and AltSchool.[72]\nIn 2017, Founders Fund bought about $15\u201320 million worth of bitcoin. In January 2018, the firm told investors that due to the cryptocurrency's surge the holdings were worth hundreds of millions of dollars.[73]\nAlso in 2017, Thiel was one of the first outside investors in Clearview AI, a facial recognition technology startup that has raised concerns in the tech world and media for its risks of weaponization.[74][75]\n\nValar Ventures\nFurther information: Valar Ventures\nThrough Valar Ventures, an internationally focused venture firm he cofounded with Andrew McCormack and James Fitzgerald,[76] Thiel was an early investor in Xero, a software firm headquartered in New Zealand.[77] Valar Ventures also invested in New Zealand-based companies Pacific Fibre[78] and Booktrack.[79]\n\nMithril Capital\nIn June 2012, he launched Mithril Capital Management, named after the fictitious metal in The Lord of the Rings, with Jim O'Neill and Ajay Royan. Unlike Clarium Capital, Mithril Capital, a fund with $402 million at the time of launch, targets companies that are beyond the startup stage and ready to scale up.[80][81]\n\nY Combinator\nIn March 2015, Thiel joined Y Combinator as one of 10 part-time partners.[82] In November 2017, it was reported that Y Combinator had severed its ties with Thiel.[83]\nBusiness Insider reported that Thiel became an FBI informant in 2021.[84][85]\n\nGawker lawsuit\nMain article: Bollea v. Gawker\nIn May 2016, Thiel confirmed in an interview with The New York Times that he had paid $10 million in legal expenses to finance several lawsuits brought by others, including a lawsuit by Terry Bollea (Hulk Hogan) against Gawker Media for invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and infringement of personality rights after Gawker made sections of a sex tape involving Bollea public.[86] The jury awarded Bollea $140 million, and Gawker announced it was permanently closing due to the lawsuit in August 2016.[87]  Thiel referred to his financial support of Bollea's case as one of the \"greater philanthropic things that I've done.\"[88]\nThiel said he was motivated to sue Gawker after they published a 2007 article publicly outing him, headlined \"Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.\" Thiel stated that Gawker articles about others, including his friends, had \"ruined people's lives for no reason,\" and said, \"It's less about revenge and more about specific deterrence.\"[88] In response to criticism that his funding of lawsuits against Gawker could restrict the freedom of the press, Thiel cited his donations to the Committee to Protect Journalists and stated, \"I refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violations. I think much more highly of journalists than that. It's precisely because I respect journalists that I do not believe they are endangered by fighting back against Gawker.\"[88]\nOn 15 August 2016, Thiel published an opinion piece in The New York Times in which he argued that his defense of online privacy went beyond Gawker.[89] He highlighted his support for the Intimate Privacy Protection Act and said that athletes and business executives have the right to stay in the closet as long as they want to.[89]\n\nPolitical views and activities\nThis article is part of a series onConservatismin the United States\nSchools\nCompassionate\nFiscal\nFusion\nLibertarian\nModerate\nMovement\nNeo\nPaleo\nProgressive\nSocial\nTraditionalist\n\n\nPrinciples\nAmerican exceptionalism\nAnti-communism\nChristian nationalism\nClassical liberalism\nConstitutionalism\nFamily values\nJudeo-Christian values\nLimited government\nMilitarism\nMoral absolutism\nNatural law\nPatriotism\nRepublicanism\nRight to bear arms\nRule of law\nTradition\n\n\nHistory\nConservative coalition\nConservative Democrat\nConservative Manifesto\nLoyalists\nMcCarthyism\nModern timeline\nNew Right\nOld Right\nOverview\nReagan Doctrine\nReaganomics\nStalwart Republicans\nSouthern Agrarians\n\n\nIntellectuals\nBabbitt\nBoorstin\nBozell Jr.\nBuchanan\nBuckley\nBurnham\nChambers\nDolan\nEliot\nGeorge\nGoldberg\nGottfried\nHanson\nHazony\nHoppe\nJaffa\nKirk\nKirkpatrick\nKreeft\nKristol (Bill)\nKristol (Irving)\nKuehnelt-Leddihn\nLaffer\nLasch\nLodge\nLovecraft\nLukacs\nMansfield\nMeese\nMeyer\nNisbet\nNock\nPodhoretz\nRansom\nSantayana\nSowell\nStrauss\nViereck\nVoegelin\nWashington\nWeaver\nWill\n\n\nPoliticians\nAbbott\nAdams\nQuincy Adams\nAgnew\nBuchanan\nBush (George H.

Sacks published The Diversity Myth, a book that criticized political correctness and multiculturalism in higher education. The following year, writing for Stanford Magazine, they argued against affirmative action in the United States, saying that it had hurt, not helped, the \"disadvantaged\" and had led to increased segregation at Stanford University in the name of \"diversity\".[93]\n\"The Straussian Moment,\" an essay written by Thiel in 2004, is sometimes considered to be a fundamental text in his political thinking and was the subject of a 2019 interview at the Hoover Institution. The essay draws on several thinkers and political theorists and argues that the September 11 attacks upset \"the entire political and military framework of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,\" and therefore \"a reexamination of the foundations of modern politics\" was needed.[1]\nThiel explained in a 2009 essay that he had come to \"no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible\", due in large part to welfare beneficiaries and women in general being \"notoriously tough for libertarians\" constituencies, and that he had focused efforts on new technologies (namely cyberspace, space colonization and seasteading) that could create \"a new space for freedom\" beyond current politics.[94] Said essay has been referenced by Curtis Yarvin and Nick Land, the main theorists of the neo-reactionary movement, in their writings.[95]\nIn a 2015 conversation with Tyler Cowen, Thiel claimed that innovative breakthroughs were happening in computing/IT and not the physical world. He lamented the lack of progress in space travel, high-speed transit, and medical devices. As a cause for the discrepancy, he said: \"I would say that we lived in a world in which bits were unregulated and atoms were regulated.\"[96]\nIn 2019, Thiel called Google \"seemingly treasonous\" and urged a government investigation, citing Google's work with China and asking whether DeepMind or Google's senior management had been \"infiltrated\" by foreign intelligence agencies.[97]\nThiel is a member of the Steering Committee[98] of the Bilderberg Group, a private, annual gathering of intellectual figures, political leaders, and business executives.[99]\n\nSupport for political activism\nThiel, who is gay,[100][101] has supported mostly conservative gay rights causes such as the American Foundation for Equal Rights and GOProud.[102]  He invited conservative columnist and friend Ann Coulter to Homocon 2010 as a guest speaker.[103] Coulter later dedicated her 2011 book, Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America, to Thiel.[104] Thiel is mentioned in the acknowledgments of Coulter's \u00a1Adios, America!: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole.[105] In 2012, Thiel donated $10,000 to Minnesotans United for All Families, in order to fight Minnesota Amendment 1[106] that proposed to ban marriage between same-sex couples there.\nIn 2009, it was reported that Thiel helped fund college student James O'Keefe's \"Taxpayers Clearing House\" video\u2014a satirical look at the Wall Street bailout.[107] O'Keefe went on to produce the ACORN undercover sting videos but, through a spokesperson, Thiel denied involvement in the ACORN sting.[107]\nIn July 2012, Thiel made a $1 million donation to the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative 501(c)(4) organization, becoming the group's largest contributor.[108] Club for Growth is a conservative organization with an agenda focused on cutting taxes and other economic issues.\n\nSupport for political candidates\nThiel is a member of the Republican Party.[109] He contributes to both Libertarian and Republican candidates and causes.\n\nThiel speaking at the 2016 Republican National Convention\nIn December 2007, Thiel endorsed Ron Paul for President.[110] After Paul failed to secure the Republican nomination, Thiel contributed to the John McCain campaign.[111]\nIn 2010, Thiel supported Meg Whitman in her unsuccessful bid for the governorship of California. He contributed the maximum allowable $25,900 to the Whitman campaign.[112]\nIn 2012, Thiel, along with Nosek and Scott Banister, put their support behind the Endorse Liberty Super PAC. Collectively they gave $3.9 million to Endorse Liberty, whose purpose was to promote Ron Paul. As of 31 January 2012, Endorse Liberty reported spending about $3.3 million promoting Paul by setting up two YouTube channels, buying ads from Google, Facebook and StumbleUpon, and building a presence on the Web.[113] After Paul again failed to secure the nomination, Thiel contributed to the Mitt Romney/Paul Ryan presidential ticket of 2012.[111]\nThiel initially supported Carly Fiorina's campaign during the 2016 GOP presidential primary elections.[114] After Fiorina dropped out, Thiel supported Donald Trump and became one of the California delegates for Trump's nomination. He was a headline speaker during the convention, during which he announced that he was \"proud to be gay,\" for which the assembled Republicans cheered.[115][116] On 15 October 2016, Thiel announced a $1.25 million donation in support of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.[117] Thiel stated to The New York Times: \"I didn't give him any money for a long time because I didn't think it mattered, and then the campaign asked me to.\"[118] After Trump's victory, Thiel was named to the executive committee of the President-elect's transition team.[119]\nThiel also has his own political-action committee, Free Forever, which is committed to supporting political candidates who support stricter border control, restrictive immigration policy, funds for veterans, and anti-interventionist foreign policy, among other things.[120][121]\nBy February 2022, Thiel was one of the largest donors to Republican candidates in the 2022 election campaign with more than $20.4 million in contributions. He supported 16 senatorial and congressional candidates, several of whom were proponents of the falsehood that there was significant voter fraud in the 2020 election. Two of said senatorial candidates (Blake Masters and J. D. Vance) were also tech investors who had previously worked for Thiel.[122]\nIn 2023, Barton Gellman of The Atlantic wrote that Thiel \"has lost interest in democracy\" and that \"he wouldn\u2019t be giving money to any politician, including Donald Trump, in the next presidential campaign\".[123]\n\nPhilanthropy\nFurther information: Thiel Foundation\nThiel carries out most of his philanthropic activities through the Thiel Foundation.[124][125]\n\nResearch\nArtificial intelligence\nIn 2006, Thiel provided $100,000 of matching funds to back the Singularity Challenge donation drive of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (now known as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute), a nonprofit organization that promotes the development of friendly artificial intelligence.[126] He provided half of the $400,000 matching funds for the 2007 donation drive, and as of 2013 the Thiel Foundation had donated over $1 million to the institute.[126] Additionally, he has spoken at multiple Singularity Summits.[127][128][129] At the 2009 Singularity Summit, he said his greatest concern is the technological singularity not arriving soon enough.[128]\nIn December 2015, OpenAI announced that Thiel was one of their financial backers, a nonprofit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence.[130]\nThiel also backed DeepMind, a UK start-up that was acquired by Google in early 2014 for \u00a3400 million.[131]\n\nLife extension\nIn September 2006, Thiel announced that he would donate $3.5 million to foster anti-aging research through the non-profit Methuselah Mouse Prize foundation.[132][133] He gave the following reasons for his pledge: \"Rapid advances in biological science foretell of a treasure trove of discoveries this century, including dramatically improved health and longevity for all. I'm backing Dr. [Aubrey] de Grey, because I believe that his revolutionary approach to aging research will accelerate this process, allowing many people alive today to enjoy radically longer and healthier lives for themselves and their loved ones.\" As of February 2017, he had donated over $7 million to the foundation.[134]\nWhen asked \"What is the biggest achievement that you haven't achieved yet?\" by the moderator of a discussion panel at the Venture Alpha West 2014 conference, Thiel said he wants to make progress on anti-aging research.[135] Thiel also said that he is registered to be cryonically preserved, meaning that he would be subject to low-temperature preservation in case of his legal death in hopes that he might be successfully revived by future medical technology, and is signed up with the Alcor Life Extension Foundation.[20]\n\nSeasteading\nOn 15 April 2008, Thiel pledged $500,000 to the newly created non-profit Seasteading Institute,[136] directed by Patri Friedman, whose mission is \"to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems.\"[137][138] At one of the institute's conferences, he described seasteading as \"one of the few technological frontiers that has the promise to create a new space for human freedom.\"[139] In 2011, Thiel gave $1.25 million to the Seasteading Institute,[140][141] but resigned from its board the same year.[142] In a 2017 interview with The New York Times, Thiel said seasteads are \"not quite feasible from an engineering perspective\" and \"still very far in the future\".[143][144]\n\nThiel Fellowship\nOn 29 September 2010, Thiel created the Thiel Fellowship, which annually awards $100,000 to 20 people under the age of 23 in order to spur them to drop out of college and create their own ventures.[145][146][147] According to Thiel, for many young people, college is the path to take when they have no idea what to do with their lives:\n\nI feel I was personally very guilty of this; you don't know what to do with your life, so you get a college degree; you don't know what you're going to do with your college degree, so you get a graduate degree. In my case, it was law school, which is the classic thing one does when one has no idea what else to do. I don't have any big regrets, but if I had to do it over I would try to think more about the future than I did at the time... You cannot get out of student debt even if you personally go bankrupt, it's a form of almost like indentured servitude, it's attached to your physical person for the rest of your life.[20]\nBreakout Labs\nIn November 2011, the Thiel Foundation announced the creation of Breakout Labs, a grant-making program intended \"to fill the funding gap that exists for innovative research outside the confines of an academic institution, large corporation, or government.\"[148][149] It offers grants of up to $350,000 to science-focused start-ups, \"with no strings attached\".[150][151] In April 2012, Breakout Labs announced its first set of grantees.[149][152] In total, 12 startups received funding, for a total of $4.5 million in grants.[150] One of the first ventures to receive funding from Breakout Labs was 3Scan, a tissue imaging platform.[151]\n\nOther causes\nThe Thiel Foundation is a supporter of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which promotes the right of journalists to report the news freely without fear of reprisal.[153] Beginning in 2008, Thiel has donated over $1 million to the CPJ.[154] He is also a supporter of the Human Rights Foundation, which organizes the Oslo Freedom Forum.[155][156] In 2011 he was a featured speaker at the Oslo Freedom Forum, and the Thiel Foundation was one of the event's main sponsors.[156]\nIn 2011, Thiel made a NZ$1 million donation to an appeal fund for the casualties of the Christchurch earthquake.[157]\n\nPersonal life\nThiel married his long-time partner Matt Danzeisen in October 2017, in Vienna, Austria.[158] Danzeisen works as a portfolio manager at Thiel Capital.[159] Thiel was also in a long-term relationship with Jeff Thomas, a social media influencer, from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic until Thomas' sudden death in March 2023.[160]\n\nReligious views\nThiel is a self-described Christian and a promoter of Ren\u00e9 Girard's Christian anthropology.[161] He grew up in an evangelical household but, as of 2011, describes his religious beliefs as \"somewhat heterodox\", and stated: \"I believe Christianity is true but I don't sort of feel a compelling need to convince other people of that.\"[48] Thiel has participated in Veritas Forum events with the noted theologian N. T. Wright discussing religion, politics, and technology.[162][163]\nDuring his time at Stanford University, Thiel attended a lecture given by Ren\u00e9 Girard. Girard, a Catholic, explained the role of sacrifice and the scapegoat mechanism in resolving social conflict, which appealed to Thiel as it offered a basis for his Christian faith without the fundamentalism of his parents.[164]\n\nChess\nThiel began playing chess at the age of six,[22] and was at one time one of the strongest junior players in the United States.[165][166][167] He holds the title of Life Master,[168][169] but has not competed since 2003.[109] On 30 November 2016, Thiel made the ceremonial first move in the first tiebreak game of the World Chess Championship 2016 between Sergey Karjakin and Magnus Carlsen.[166][170][171]\n\nMedia appearances\nThiel is an occasional commentator on CNBC, having appeared on both Closing Bell with Kelly Evans, and Squawk Box with Becky Quick.[172] He has been interviewed twice by Charlie Rose on PBS.[173] He has also contributed articles to The Wall Street Journal, First Things, Forbes, and Policy Review, a journal formerly published by the Hoover Institution, on whose board he sits.\nIn The Social Network, Thiel was portrayed by Wallace Langham.[174] He described the film as \"wrong on many levels\".[175]\nThiel was the inspiration for the Peter Gregory character on HBO's Silicon Valley.[176] Thiel said of Gregory, \"I liked him... I think eccentric is always better than evil\".[177]\nJonas L\u00fcscher stated in an interview with Basellandschaftliche Zeitung that he based the character Tobias Erkner in his novel Kraft (\"Force\") on Thiel.[178]\nRight Time to Thiel by satirist Jan B\u00f6hmermann (2022) is a Bond theme-style song and music video.[179]\n\nNew Zealand citizenship\nThiel was a German citizen by birth, and became an American citizen by naturalization.[180] He had received permanent residency in New Zealand in 2011.[181][182] He had visited the country on four occasions prior to his application for citizenship,[183] and had spent 12 days in New Zealand, fewer than the typical residency requirement of 1,350 days.[184] When he applied, he stated he had no intention of living in New Zealand, which is a criterion for citizenship.[185] Then-Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy waived those normal requirements, under an \"exceptional circumstances\" clause of the Citizenships Act.[186][183][185]\nHe became a New Zealand citizen in 2011, which became public in 2017.[186] In 2015, he purchased a 193-hectare estate near W\u0101naka, which fitted the classification of \"sensitive land\" and required foreign buyers to obtain permission from New Zealand's Overseas Investment Office. Thiel did not require permission as he was a citizen.[187]\nThiel's application cited his contribution to the economy\u2014he had founded a venture capital fund in Auckland before applying, and invested $7 million in two local companies\u2014as well as a $1 million donation to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake appeal fund.[183] Rod Drury, founder of Xero, also provided a formal reference for Thiel's application.[186] Thiel's case was cited by critics as an example of how New Zealand passports can be bought,[183][188] something the New Zealand government denied.[183] At the time that his citizenship was revealed, The New Zealand Herald came out with the report that the New Zealand Defence Force, the Security Intelligence Service and the Government Communications and Security Bureau have long-standing links with Thiel's Palantir.[184]\n\nRoth IRA\nIn 2021 it was revealed by ProPublica that Thiel had purchased 1.7 million founders shares in the entity that would become PayPal using $1,700 in a Roth IRA in 1999. Due to the rapid growth in the value of the shares as PayPal grew and was later acquired by eBay, it allowed Thiel to turn his $1,700 Roth IRA into an account worth more than $5 billion as of 2019. Most of this increase in the value of the Roth was due to him re-investing his PayPal proceeds into companies like Palantir and Facebook which grew quickly after his investment. If Thiel waits until he turns 60 in 2027, he can withdraw the entire $5 billion+ amount tax free.[189]\n\nAwards and honors\nIn 2006, Thiel won the Herman Lay Award for Entrepreneurship.[190]\nIn 2007, he was honored as a Young Global leader by the World Economic Forum as one of the 250 most distinguished leaders age 40 and under.[191]\nOn 7 November 2009, Thiel was awarded an honorary degree from Guatemalan Universidad Francisco Marroquin.[192]\nIn 2012, Students For Liberty, an organization dedicated to spreading libertarian ideals on college campuses, awarded Thiel its \"Alumnus of the Year\" award.[193]\nIn February 2013, Thiel received a TechCrunch Crunchie Award for Venture Capitalist of the Year.[194]\nPublished books\nThe Diversity Myth\nIn 1995, the Independent Institute published The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and the Politics of Intolerance at Stanford, which Thiel co-authored along with fellow tech entrepreneur David O. Sacks, and with a foreword by the late Emory University historian Elizabeth Fox-Genovese.[195] The book is critical of political correctness and multiculturalism in higher education and alleges that it has diluted academic rigor. Thiel and Sacks' writings drew criticism from then-Stanford Provost Condoleezza Rice and then-Stanford President Gerhard Casper in describing Thiel and Sacks' view of Stanford as \"a cartoon, not a description of our freshman curriculum\"[196] and their commentary as \"demagoguery, pure and simple.\"[197]\nIn 2016, Thiel apologized for two statements he made in the book: 1) \"The purpose of the rape crisis movement seems as much about vilifying men as about raising 'awareness'\" and 2) \"But since a multicultural rape charge may indicate nothing more than belated regret, a woman might 'realize' that she had been 'raped' the next day or even many days later.\" He stated: \"More than two decades ago, I co-wrote a book with several insensitive, crudely argued statements. As I've said before, I wish I'd never written those things. I'm sorry for it. Rape in all forms is a crime. I regret writing passages that have been taken to suggest otherwise.\"[198]\n\nZero to One\nIn Spring 2012, Thiel taught CS 183: Startup at Stanford University.[199] Notes for the course, taken by student Blake Masters, led to a book titled Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future by Thiel and Masters, which was released in September 2014.[200][201][202] (Thiel would later go on to endorse Masters' campaign in the 2022 United States Senate election in Arizona and spend more than $10 million in its support.[203])\nDerek Thompson, writing for The Atlantic, stated Zero to One \"might be the best business book I've read\". He described it as a \"self-help book for entrepreneurs, bursting with bromides\" but also as a \"lucid and profound articulation of capitalism and success in the 21st century economy.\"[204]\n\nTools of Titans\nThiel also has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss' self-help book Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers.\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ a b Wiener, Anna (27 October 2021). \"What Is It About Peter Thiel?\".

He began his career in 1988 at the tabloid The Sun. In 1994, aged 29, he was appointed editor of the News of the World by Rupert Murdoch, which made him the youngest editor of a British national newspaper in more than half a century.[2] From 1995, Morgan edited the Daily Mirror, but was fired in 2004.[3] He was the editorial director of First News from 2006 to 2007. In 2014, Morgan became the first editor-at-large of the MailOnline website's US operation. \nAs a television presenter, Morgan hosted the ITV talk show Piers Morgan's Life Stories (2009\u20132020) and the CNN talk show Piers Morgan Live (2011\u20132014). He co-presented the ITV Breakfast programme Good Morning Britain with Susanna Reid (2015\u20132021), and has also been a judge on the talent shows America's Got Talent (2006\u20132011) and Britain's Got Talent (2007\u20132010).[4][5][6] In 2008, Morgan won The Celebrity Apprentice US, appearing with future US president Donald Trump.[7][8] Since 2022, he has been a presenter for TalkTV on the programme Piers Morgan Uncensored.[9][10]\nMorgan was the editor of the Daily Mirror during the period in which the paper was implicated in the phone hacking scandal. In 2011, Morgan denied having ever hacked a phone and stated that he had not, \"to my knowledge published any story obtained from the hacking of a phone\". The following year, he was criticised in the findings of the Leveson Inquiry by chair Brian Leveson, who stated that comments made in Morgan's testimony about phone hacking were \"utterly unpersuasive\" and \"that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it\".[11]  The judge in a 2023 court case against Mirror Group Newspapers found truthful evidence that Morgan knew about private phone hacking from a reporter, shared a method of phone hacking with a media professional while being questioned about a reporting scoop, and that Morgan played another's private phone message in the newsroom he had received from another tabloid editor.[12][13]\nMorgan's outspoken views and controversial comments on Good Morning Britain have led Ofcom to adjudicate on multiple occasions.[14][15][16] In March 2021, Morgan left the programme with immediate effect, following his criticism of the Oprah with Meghan and Harry interview.[17][18] Ofcom received over 57,000 complaints from viewers,[19] including a complaint from Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, herself;[20] Morgan was subsequently cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom.[21]\n\n\nEarly life and education\nMorgan was born in Reigate, Surrey on 30 March 1965, the son of Vincent Eamonn O'Meara, an Irish dentist from County Offaly,[22][23] and Gabrielle Georgina Sybille (n\u00e9e Oliver),[24] an English woman who raised Morgan as a Catholic.[24][25] He has a brother, Jeremy, who is older than him by two years.[26] A few months after his birth, the family moved to Newick, East Sussex.[22] His father died when Morgan was 11 months old; his mother later married Glynne Pughe-Morgan,[27][28] a Welsh pub landlord who later worked in the meat distribution business, and he took his stepfather's surname.[2] He was educated at the independent Cumnor House prep school between the ages of seven and 13, then Chailey School, a comprehensive secondary school in Chailey, followed by Priory School, Lewes, for sixth form.[26] After nine months at Lloyd's of London, Morgan studied journalism at Harlow College,[2] joining the Surrey and South London Newspaper Group in 1985.[29]\n\nPress career\nAt the Murdoch titles (1988\u20131995)\nMorgan began to work as a freelance at The Sun in 1988, at this point dropping his double-barrelled name. He told Hunter Davies in December 1994 that he was personally recruited by Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie to work on the newspaper's show business column \"Bizarre\", his first high-profile post.[2] Although he was not a fan of pop music, he was considered skilled at self-publicity and became the column's main writer. \"I became the Friend of the Stars, a rampant egomaniac, pictured all the time with famous people \u2013 Madonna, Stallone, Bowie, Paul McCartney, hundreds of them. It was shameless, as they didn't know me from Adam\", he told Davies.[2]\nIn January 1994, he became editor of the News of the World after being appointed to the job by Rupert Murdoch. Initially an acting editor, he was confirmed in the summer, becoming at 29 the youngest national newspaper editor in more than half a century.[2] In this period, the newspaper led with a series of scoops for which Morgan credited a highly efficient newsdesk and publicist Max Clifford.[30]\nMorgan left this post in 1995 shortly after publishing photographs of Catherine Victoria Lockwood, then wife of Charles, Earl Spencer, leaving an addictive disorders clinic in Surrey.[31] This action ran against the editors' code of conduct,[32] a misdemeanour for which the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint against Morgan.[32] Murdoch was reported as having said that \"the boy went too far\"[33] and publicly distanced himself from the story.[34] Fearful of a privacy law action if he had not criticised one of his employees, Murdoch is said to have apologised to Morgan in private.[35][36]\nThe incident was reported to have contributed to Morgan's decision to leave for the Daily Mirror editorship.[37] Morgan's autobiography The Insider states that he left the News of the World for the Mirror of his own choice. It asserts he was an admirer of former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for most of her period of office, making the appointment surprising as the Mirror is a Labour-supporting title.[26]\n\nDaily Mirror editor\nAs editor of the Daily Mirror, Morgan apologised on television for the headline (rendered in upper case) \"Achtung Surrender! For You Fritz Ze Euro Championship Is Over\" on 25 June 1996, a day before England met Germany in a semi-final of the Euro '96 football championships.[30][38][39][40]  The headline was accompanied by an open letter from Morgan parodying Neville Chamberlain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939. \"It was intended as a joke, but anyone who was offended by it must have taken it seriously, and to those people I say sorry,\" he said.[40] Germany won the match and later the championship at Wembley Stadium, London.[citation needed]\nUnder Morgan' leadership, the Daily Mirror spent \u00a316\u00a0million on a rebranding project, including the dropping of \"Daily\" from the masthead in February 1997,[41] which was later reversed. Roy Greenslade wrote in August 1999 that Morgan's editorship \"has made a huge difference: his enormous enthusiasm, determination and focus is a major plus\".[42]\nMorgan was the subject of an investigation in 2000 after Suzy Jagger wrote an article for The Daily Telegraph revealing that he had bought \u00a320,000 worth of shares in the computer company Viglen soon before the Mirror's \"City Slickers\" column tipped Viglen as a good buy.[43] Morgan was found by the Press Complaints Commission to have breached the Code of Conduct on financial journalism, but kept his job. The \"City Slickers\" columnists, Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, were both found to have committed further breaches of the Code and were sacked before the inquiry concluded.[44] Further enquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry in 2004 cleared Morgan of any charges.[45] On 7 December 2005, Bhoyrul and Hipwell were convicted of conspiracy to breach the Financial Services Act. During the trial it emerged that Morgan had bought \u00a367,000 worth of Viglen shares, emptying his bank account and investing under his (first) wife's name as well.[46]\nThe Mirror attempted to move mid-market in 2002, eschewing the more trivial stories of show-business and gossip, and appointed Christopher Hitchens as a columnist, but sales declined.[26][47] In October 2003, journalist and television personality Jeremy Clarkson emptied a glass of water over Morgan during the last flight of Concorde in response to some photographs published in the Mirror.[48] In March 2004, at the British Press Awards, Clarkson punched Morgan three times during another argument.[48] In Campbell v MGN Ltd,[49] the Law Lords in May 2004 found in favour of model Naomi Campbell on privacy grounds after the Mirror had published a photograph of her entering a Narcotics Anonymous clinic. Morgan was critical of the judgement saying it was \"a good day for lying, drug-abusing prima donnas who want to have their cake with the media and the right to then shamelessly guzzle with their Cristal champagne.\"[50][51]\nIn the wake of the Abu Ghraib torture scandal, Morgan was sacked as editor of the Daily Mirror \"with immediate effect\" on 14 May 2004, after refusing to apologise to Sly Bailey, then head of Trinity Mirror, for authorising the newspaper's publication of fake photographs.[52] The photos were alleged to show Iraqi prisoners being abused by British Army soldiers from the Queen's Lancashire Regiment.[53] Within days the photographs were shown to be crude fakes. According to official British sources, the photographs were apparently taken in North-West England. Under the headline \"SORRY..WE WERE HOAXED\", the Mirror responded that it had fallen victim to a \"calculated and malicious hoax\" and apologised for the publication of the photographs.[54][55] However, Morgan refused to admit that the photographs were faked, and stated that the abuse shown in the photographs is similar to the sort of abuse that was happening in the British Army in Iraq at the time.[56]\n\nPhone hacking allegations\nDuring Morgan's tenure as editor, the Daily Mirror was advised by Steven Nott that voicemail interception was possible by means of a standard PIN code. Despite staff initially expressing enthusiasm for the story it did not appear in the paper, although it did subsequently feature in a South Wales Argus article and on BBC Radio 5 Live in October 1999. On 18 July 2011, Nott was visited by officers of Operation Weeting.[57]\nHe came under criticism for his \"boasting\" about phone hacking from Conservative MP Louise Mensch, who has since apologised for these accusations.[58]\nIn July 2011, in a sequence of articles, political blogger Paul Staines alleged that while editor of the Daily Mirror in 2002 Morgan published a story concerning the affair of Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson and Ulrika Jonsson while knowing it to have been obtained by phone hacking.[59]\nOn 20 December 2011, Morgan appeared as a witness by satellite link from the United States at the Leveson Inquiry.[60] While he said he had no reason to believe that phone hacking had occurred at the Mirror while he was in charge there, he admitted to hearing a recording of an answerphone message left by Paul McCartney for Heather Mills, but refused to \"discuss where that tape was played or who made [it] \u2013 it would compromise a source.\"[60] Appearing as a witness at the same Inquiry on 9 February 2012, Mills was asked under oath if she had ever made a recording of McCartney's phone call or had played it to Morgan; she replied: \"Never\".[61][62] She said that she had never authorised Morgan, or anybody, to access or listen to her voicemails.[61] Mills told the inquiry that Morgan, \"a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years\", would have relished telling the inquiry if she had played a personal voicemail message to him.[62]\nOn 23 May 2012, Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman was a witness at the Leveson Inquiry. He recalled a lunch with the Mirror editor in September 2002 at which Morgan outlined the means of hacking [or accessing] a mobile phone voicemail, using the SIM card network's default security code.[63]\nOn 28 November 2012, the Channel 4 documentary Taking on the Tabloids, fronted by actor and phone hacking victim Hugh Grant, showed footage from a 2003 interview with Morgan by the singer and phone hacking victim Charlotte Church, during which he explained to her how to avoid answerphone messages being listened to by journalists. He said: \"You can access ... voicemails by typing in a number. Now, are you really telling me that journalists aren't going to do that?\"[64][65]\nOn 29 November 2012, the official findings of the Leveson Inquiry were released, in which Lord Justice Leveson said that Morgan's testimony under oath on phone hacking was \"utterly unpersuasive\". He stated:  \"[The] evidence does not establish that [Morgan] authorised the hacking of voicemails or that journalists employed by TMG [Trinity Mirror Group] were indulging in this practice ... What it does, however, clearly prove is that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it.\"[11][66]\nOn 6 December 2013, Morgan was interviewed, under caution, by police officers from Operation Weeting investigating phone hacking allegations at Mirror Group Newspapers during his tenure as editor.[67]\nOn 24 September 2014, the Trinity Mirror publishing group admitted for the first time that some of its journalists had been involved in phone hacking and agreed to pay compensation to four people who sued for the alleged hacking of voicemails.[68][69] Six other phone-hacking claims had already been settled. The BBC reported that it had seen legal papers showing that although the alleged hacking could have taken place as early as 1998, the bulk of the alleged wrongdoing took place in the early 2000s when Morgan was the Daily Mirror editor.[70] The admissions by Trinity Mirror came whilst the Metropolitan Police were investigating into the phone hacking allegations. Morgan has always denied any involvement in the practice.[70]\nIn June 2023, during his case against Morgan's former employer, Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), Prince Harry accused Morgan of attacking himself and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to dissuade him from his legal action and of hacking his phone and that of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales.[71][72][73] On 15 December 2023, Harry was awarded \u00a3140,600 by the High Court in damages against MGN, after 15 out of 33 sample articles about him in his claim were ruled as being the product of phone hacking or other unlawful information gathering.[74][75][76] In the ruling, Mr Justice Fancourt said Morgan and other editors knew about the phone hacking at their publications and were involved in it.[77][78][79] In a statement made in response to the ruling, Morgan denied that he was involved in any phone hacking and reviled Harry.[80][81] His statement was met with widespread criticism including from the former chair of the Independent Press Standards Organisation Sir Alan Moses.[82][83][84]\nAs a result of the judge's ruling, the pressure group Hacked Off called for the police to open an investigation into possible perjury committed by senior staff members at The Mirror, during the Leveson Inquiry.[85][60]\n\nPost-Mirror press activities\nIn partnership with Matthew Freud, he gained ownership in May 2005 of Press Gazette, a media trade publication together with its \"cash cow\", the British Press Awards, in a deal worth \u00a31\u00a0million.[86][87] This ownership was cited as one of the reasons many major newspapers boycotted the 2006 awards.[88] Press Gazette entered administrative receivership toward the end of 2006,[89] before being sold to a trade buyer.\nFirst News was launched by Morgan on 4 May 2006. A weekly paper aimed at seven to 14-year-olds, he said at its launch that the paper was to be \"Britain's first national newspaper for children\".[90][91] Morgan was editorial director at First News, responsible for bringing in celebrity involvement. He referred to the role as \"editorial overlord and frontman\".[92]\nIn 2007, Morgan was filmed falling off a Segway, breaking three ribs. Simon Cowell outspokenly mocked Morgan's previous comment in 2003, in a Mirror headline after former U.S. President George W. Bush fell off a Segway: \"You'd have to be an idiot to fall off wouldn't you, Mr\u00a0President\".[93][94][95]\nIn 2012, following the revelation of Jimmy Savile's sexual abuse against children, Morgan said he had \"never met\" Savile in his lifetime, contradicting a 2009 piece he wrote in The Mail on Sunday's Night & Day magazine saying that \"As I left, Jimmy Savile came up to me. 'Your TV shows are BRILLIANT!, he exclaimed. ... I've always loved Jimmy Savile.\"[96]\nIn September 2014, Morgan became the first editor-at-large of the MailOnline website's US operation and wrote several columns a week.[97]\n\nTelevision career\nMorgan in 2012\nMorgan's career expanded into television presenting before he left the Daily Mirror. He presented a three-part television documentary series for the BBC titled The Importance of Being Famous (2003), about fame and the manner in which celebrities are covered by modern media. At the annual Pride of Britain Awards broadcast on ITV, Morgan chaired a panel of prominent people who had chosen the recipients of the awards from 1999 to 2006.[98] He co-hosted a current affairs interview show on Channel 4 with Amanda Platell, Morgan and Platell. Morgan and Platell were put together because of their opposing political viewpoints; Platell interrogated guests from the right wing, Morgan from the left wing.[99] The show was dropped after three series reputedly because of poor viewing figures, although the chairman of Channel 4 Luke Johnson was reported not to like the programme.[100]\nThroughout 2006, Morgan appeared as a judge on the television show America's Got Talent alongside Brandy Norwood and David Hasselhoff on NBC. Morgan was chosen by Simon Cowell as a replacement for himself because of the conditions of his American Idol contract. Morgan appeared as a celebrity contestant on Comic Relief Does The Apprentice in 2007 to raise money for the BBC charity telethon Comic Relief. After his team lost, Morgan was selected by Sir Alan Sugar as the contestant to be fired.[101] In 2007, Morgan appeared as a judge for the second season of America's Got Talent and also appeared as a judge on Britain's Got Talent on ITV with Amanda Holden and Simon Cowell. He also presented You Can't Fire Me, I'm Famous on BBC One. He fronted a three-part documentary about Sandbanks for ITV entitled Piers Morgan on Sandbanks in January 2008.[102] In 2008, Morgan signed a two-year \"golden handcuffs\" deal with ITV in May, reportedly worth \u00a32\u00a0million per year. As part of the deal, he would continue as a judge on Britain's Got Talent for at least two more series and front a new chat show. He also made some interview specials, plus three more documentaries from various countries. Morgan's golden handcuffs deal was the first signing by ITV's new director of television, Peter Fincham.[103]\nIn February 2009, he began a three-part series, Piers Morgan On..., which saw him visit Dubai, Monte Carlo and Hollywood.[104] The programme returned for a second series in 2010 when Morgan visited Las Vegas in one episode.[105] In 2009, Morgan also began hosting Piers Morgan's Life Stories on ITV, with Sharon Osbourne as the subject of the first episode.[106] Other guests on the programme included Cheryl[107] and the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown.[108] On 17 January 2011, Morgan replaced Larry King in CNN's evening line-up with his show, Piers Morgan Live.[109][110] After poor ratings, the show was cancelled[111] in February 2014 and ended its run in March 2014.[112] Commenting on the viewing figures, Morgan said that he was \"a British guy debating American cultural issues, including guns, which has been very polarizing, and there is no doubt that there are many in the audience who are tired of me banging on about it.\"[113]\nFrom 13 to 17 April 2015, Morgan guest-hosted five episodes of Good Morning Britain on ITV and became a permanent co-host in November 2015, appearing alongside Susanna Reid and Charlotte Hawkins.[114] He often clashed with Reid, who said of her colleague: \"You can't help but go into battle with him every morning\".[115] Morgan left the series in March 2021 following a controversy over his remarks about Oprah with Meghan and Harry, which included a heated on-air argument with Alex Beresford.[116]\nFrom 2016 to 2017, Morgan interviewed female murderers on the TV series Killer Women with Piers Morgan.[117] He also presented Serial Killer with Piers Morgan, as part of the 2017 Crime & Punishment season on ITV. In October 2018, Morgan appeared as a cameo on Hollyoaks.[118]\n\nDonald Trump\nMorgan was the winner of the U.S. celebrity version of The Apprentice in 2008. He was eventually the overall winner, being named Celebrity Apprentice by host Donald Trump on 27 March, ahead of fellow finalist, American country music star Trace Adkins,[119][120] and having raised substantially more cash than all the other contestants combined.[121] Morgan was called \"ruthless, arrogant, evil and obnoxious\" by Trump in the final.[122] Morgan stated he personally would not vote for Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election (though as a permanent resident of the United States, not a citizen, he is not qualified to vote).[123] He predicted Trump's election as President of the United States and described himself as a close friend.[124] Morgan interviewed Trump on Good Morning Britain in March 2016.[125] Morgan appeared on ITV's Loose Women panel show in late January 2017, and was challenged to repudiate Trump.[126] He stated that he disagreed with him on many issues relating to gun control, climate change, abortion, and the \"Muslim travel ban\". On the latter he stated that Donald Trump had \"singled out seven countries that are undeniably war-torn, and he said we need to be very careful who we let into America from these countries\", adding that he found \"the principle of what [Trump] is doing understandable\", but that he disagreed with \"the way [Trump] has gone about it\".[127][126]\nNearly a fortnight later, on the American talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, Morgan said \"There is no Muslim ban\", as \"85% of the world's Muslims are allowed in the country\". Another participant in the discussion, Australian comedian Jim Jefferies, immediately swore at Morgan and criticised his defence of Trump.[128] After the novelist J. K. Rowling tweeted \"Yes, watching Piers Morgan being told to fuck off on live TV is *exactly* as satisfying as I'd always imagined\", the two began an exchange of words on the social media site.[129][130] Morgan criticised Trump after Trump had retweeted Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of the small far-right fascist party Britain First, in late November 2017. He tweeted to Trump: \"What the hell are you doing retweeting a bunch of unverified videos by Britain First, a bunch of disgustingly racist far-right extremists? Please STOP this madness & undo your retweets\".[131]\nIn January 2018, Morgan presented President Trump \u2013 The Piers Morgan Interview for ITV,[132][133] which many thought of as \"sycophantic\" and a \"love-in\" for Trump.[134] Of respondents to a Radio Times Twitter poll, 88% viewed Morgan as being not \"tough enough\" on Trump.[134] Morgan interviewed Trump again in July 2018 during his official visit to the UK, this time on Air Force One during an internal flight, in a TV special entitled Piers, The President and Air Force One.[135] In December 2018, Morgan wrote a letter to Trump formally applying to become White House Chief of Staff.[136] During Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom in June 2019, Morgan once again interviewed Trump, this time at the Churchill War Rooms.[137]\nIn April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Morgan wrote a highly critical article of Trump's handling of the crisis in his column for MailOnline. Morgan particularly took issue with Trump's suggestion of looking into \"ingesting\" disinfectant as a possible solution, describing it as \"batshit crazy\". In response to the criticism, Trump unfollowed Morgan on Twitter.[138][139][140] In the aftermath of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Morgan stated that Trump was \"mentally unfit\" to remain as president. He claimed that the pandemic and Trump's election loss that followed had \"sent him nuts\". In response to whether he regretted his support of Trump, Morgan said \"No question. I never thought he was capable of this.\"[141]\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex\nMorgan was briefly a friend of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex before she became the Duchess of Sussex, but claimed she cut him off early in her relationship with Prince Harry. He has been a regular critic of the couple since then, alleging they are hypocrites and claiming the Duchess is a social climber.[142]\nWhen the couple stepped away from conducting official royal duties early in 2020, Morgan described them as being \"the two most spoiled brats in history\".[143] Ten days later, he said: \"Only surprised it took her so long to get Harry to ditch his family, the monarchy, the military and his country. What a piece of work.\"[144] In a segment of Good Morning Britain on 13 January,[145] Morgan interviewed Afua Hirsch, who accused parts of the British media of behaving in a racist manner towards the Duchess, an interpretation that Morgan said was \"completely and grotesquely wrong\". InfluencHers, a group of 100 African Caribbean women, advocated an advertisers' boycott of Good Morning Britain. The campaigners described the programme as \"sanctioning bullying and blatant unapologetic disrespect of women\" in allowing Morgan's treatment of Hirsch.[146]\nWhen challenged by Decca Aitkenhead of The Sunday Times in May 2020 over \"his vendetta\" against the Duchess, with Aitkenhead suggesting he had gone too far, Morgan said: \"I think that's a perfectly fair criticism. It's probably not wise, if you're a columnist, to make things too personal. Have I taken things a bit too far? Probably. Do I think that will govern and temper how I talk about them going forward? Absolutely.\"[147]\nOn Good Morning Britain on 8 and 9 March 2021, Morgan said he doubted the accuracy of the account given by the Duchess of Sussex, in the interview Oprah with Meghan and Harry with Oprah Winfrey, in which she spoke of her mental health issues, which included suicidal thoughts, and she and Harry alleged racist comments from the extended family. A tense on-air argument with his co-host Alex Beresford on 9 March led him to walk off the set of the show. Beresford was highly critical of Morgan's attitude towards the Duchess, saying \"She's entitled to cut you off if she wants to. Has she said anything about you after she cut you off? I don't think she has, But yet you continue to trash her\".[148] Later in the day, Morgan quit the programme.[17][18][149] The UK's mental health charity Mind expressed \"disappointment\" in Morgan's comments and said individuals with experience of mental health issues should be \"treated with dignity, respect and empathy.\"[150] ITV plc's chief executive, Carolyn McCall, defended the veracity of the Duchess's comments, adding \"importantly everyone should.\"[151]\nITV News reported the Duchess had complained directly to ITV's CEO about Morgan's comments about mental health, although the broadcaster was not officially commenting on these reports.[152] Ofcom received a complaint from her.[153]\nMorgan issued a statement on Twitter, saying, \"On Monday, I said I didn't believe Meghan Markle in her Oprah interview. I've had time to reflect on this opinion, and I still don't. Freedom of speech is a hill I'm happy to die on.\"[116] Broadcaster Andrew Neil described his departure as \"a pity\" for ITV because he had brought \"energy, dynamism and controversy\" to its morning broadcast schedule, adding \"it had always lagged way behind the BBC breakfast time show and people tuned in because of him.\" Neil expressed interest in Morgan joining GB News instead.[154] However, Neil later said that talks were affected by a disagreement: \"he's [Morgan] got his own idea of what he is worth and we [GB News] have a slightly different idea of what he's worth\".[155] In Morgan's last week, Good Morning Britain surpassed the ratings of BBC Breakfast for the first time, and ITV lost almost \u00a3200m in market value following his departure.[156]\nActor and comedian Steve Coogan, a prominent supporter of press regulation, described Morgan as \"symptomatic of the problem\" with the British tabloid media and accused him of \"bullying behaviour\" regarding his attitude to the Duchess.[157]\nOn 29 November 2023 Morgan used his Piers Morgan Uncensored show to reveal the names of two members of the British Royal Family who had allegedly had conversations about the skin colour of Meghan's baby, mentioned during an interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021. Both Prince Harry and Meghan had refused to elaborate on who had made these claims. Journalist Omid Scobie named the royals in the Dutch version of his book Endgame, despite other versions not containing the names, and the book was pulled from sale.[158] After Morgan had named the royals, a source for the family said they were \"considering all options.\"[159] Morgan defended his comments the following night, saying it was \"entirely lawful\" to name the Royals.[160]\n\nOfcom complaints\nMorgan's comments during his tenure at Good Morning Britain resulted in thousands of complaints to the British media watchdog Ofcom.\nIn 2015, Morgan was criticised by Ofcom for laughing as a guest repeatedly used the word 'fucking' live on air. Although Ofcom did not take action as his co-presenter Susanna Reid quickly apologised, the watchdog expressed concern at his behaviour.[14]\nIn 2016, Ofcom received 70 complaints in relation to comments made by Morgan during an interview with the Christian magistrate Richard Page about gay marriage, comments that viewers felt \"implied Christians were homophobic\".[15] Ofcom confirmed on 13 April 2016 that Morgan would not be investigated for his comments.[161]\nOn 21 January 2020, Morgan was accused of racism and received 1,095 Ofcom complaints[162] for his comments relating to a Chinese dairy advert in which he said \"He's using ching chong ching milk\". Morgan also spoke over the advert, saying \"ching chang cho jo\". He was accused online of using language that is used to antagonise Chinese people and of mocking the Chinese language.[163]\nAfter receiving 41,015 complaints, Ofcom launched an investigation on 9 March 2021 into the remarks Morgan made about the Duchess of Sussex's mental health on Good Morning Britain.[164][165][166] The regulator confirmed on 12 March that the Duchess of Sussex had complained as well.[153] On 17 March, it was reported that complaints against Morgan had reached 57,000, breaking Ofcom's record. Morgan remained defiant, stating \"Only 57,000? I've had more people than that come up and congratulate me in the street for what I said. The vast majority of Britons are right behind me.\"[19] Ofcom cleared ITV of any wrongdoing in September 2021 and added that restricting Morgan's views would be a \"chilling restriction\" on freedom of speech but criticised his \"apparent disregard\" for the subject of suicide. Morgan described the ruling as \"a resounding victory for free speech and a resounding defeat for Princess Pinocchios.\"[167]\n\nFeuds and banned television guests\nA feud between Morgan and A. A. Gill began when Morgan described Gill's partner Nicola Formby as a sex kitten on whom the mists of time had taken their toll[168] and said she had shown him \"porn shots\" of herself. Gill said Morgan had made this up and called him a \"pretty objectionable self-publicist\".[169]\nIn May 2011, Morgan banned actor Hugh Grant from his shows on CNN and ITV after Grant spoke out against the need for the tabloid press. On Twitter he responded: \"Hugh Grant is now banned, in perpetuity, from @PiersTonight and Life Stories and anything else I ever do. Tedious little man.\"[170]\nOn 28 March 2012, MTV referred to the bad relations between Morgan and Madonna, reporting that \"Morgan has apparently felt slighted over the years by Madonna...he claims he was lied to by the singer's publicist.\"[citation needed]\nIn September 2012, it was reported that Morgan had also banned actor Kelsey Grammer. Morgan himself said, \"Kelsey Grammer saw a photo of his ex-wife Camille in the open of our show and legged it.\"[171] TVGuide reported, \"All plans were still a go for the segment until Grammer actually got in the hot seat and saw the footage the producers had planned to peg to the segment, including a picture of his ex-wife\".[172] On 26 September 2012, Fox 11 Los Angeles reported that \"many say [it] was an ambush by Piers\".[citation needed] The Huffington Post reported that \"before the interview was scheduled, it was made clear that Grammer would answer all questions, including those about [his ex-wife]. His sole request was not to show any images of her.\"[173]\nOn 4 February 2014, transgender advocate Janet Mock appeared as a guest on Piers Morgan Live to discuss her memoir, Redefining Realness. After the interview aired, Mock sent a series of tweets criticising Morgan for describing Mock as being \"formerly a man\". Morgan responded that he had \"never been treated in such a disgraceful manner\" by a guest. On 5 February, Mock appeared as a guest again to debate the dispute.[citation needed]\nMorgan has repeatedly clashed with actor John Cleese. In 2015, Cleese stated that he \"truly detested\" Morgan and had avoided him in a restaurant. He also said he thought Morgan was \"in jail\", erroneously stating that Morgan had \"admitted\" to authorising phone-hacking. Morgan responded that the \"revulsion\" between them was \"mutual\". When Cleese's tweet about detesting Morgan became his most popular to date, Cleese said \"clearly I must insult the slimy, attention-seeking little prole more often\". Morgan joked that he was glad to have been able to make Cleese \"popular again\".[174] In 2017, Cleese told Radio Times: \"I always thought he was an awful creep [...] I just didn't want to have an encounter with him and since then he's been after me and I've been after him.\"[175]\nMorgan strongly objected to the Women's March on Washington on 21 January 2017, the day after Trump's inauguration, describing protesters as \"rabid feminists\" and the multiple protests as being \"vacuous\".[176] The actor Ewan McGregor disagreed with Morgan's statements on the Women's March and pulled out of appearing on Good Morning Britain the following Tuesday after discovering Morgan would be interviewing him, along with Reid.[177] Morgan accused McGregor of being a \"paedophile-loving hypocrite\" for his past support of Roman Polanski.[178]\n\nPiers Morgan Uncensored\nOn 16 September 2021, News UK announced its new channel talkTV would launch in 2022, with Morgan being the first name signed up.[179] Morgan presented Piers Morgan Uncensored weeknights from 25 April 2022, the first and second episodes contained a new interview with Donald Trump.[10] Within a week of the first broadcast, estimated audiences had declined by 80 percent, from 316,800 to 61,700 average viewers of Morgan's show.[180] On March 7 2023, he won the Scoop of the Year award at the British Sports Journalism Awards for his interview with Cristiano Ronaldo in November 2022.[181] In June 2023, he won the TRIC award for the Interview of The Year award for the same broadcast.[182]\n\nPersonal life\nMorgan married Marion Shalloe, a hospital ward sister,[2] in 1991. The couple had three sons, and separated in 2004 before divorcing in 2008.[183][184] In June 2010, he married his second wife, journalist Celia Walden, daughter of the former Conservative MP George Walden in Swinbrook, Oxfordshire.[185] He lives in Kensington, London and has two other properties in Newick, East Sussex and Hollywood, Los Angeles.[186]\nMorgan is a supporter of Premier League football club Arsenal.[187] He was an outspoken critic of former Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and called for his sacking on many occasions. Speaking in defence of Wenger in 2015, former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson labelled Morgan an \"incredibly pompous individual\".[188] When Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey met Morgan on 26 April 2015, Ramsey refused to shake his hand due to the criticism he received from Morgan during the 2012\u201313 season. Morgan has responded by calling Ramsey 'whatshisname'.[189]\nPolitically, Morgan identified as a supporter of the Conservative Party in a 1994 interview, saying he was \"still basically a Tory\", but expressed admiration for the New Labour leader Tony Blair, saying \"he's not radical, speaks well and makes sense\".[2] He voted for the Kensington Conservative candidate in the 2019 UK general election,[190] after previously voting for the Animal Welfare Party.[191] Morgan has also stated he has previously voted for the Labour Party.[190]\nOn 24 July 2021, Morgan said he had developed COVID-19 after the Euro 2020 final, despite being fully vaccinated. He added that a strong fever, violent coughing, chills and sneezing fits left him exhausted and fearing what might come next.[192]\nMorgan is of Irish Catholic descent.[193] He has often spoken of his Catholic faith[194] and believes in an afterlife, but does not \"go to Confession, probably because it would take [him] too long\".[195]\n\nFilmography\nTelevision\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1996\n\nHave I Got News for You\n\nHimself\n\n2 episodes\n\n\n1999\u20132019\n\nQuestion Time\n\nGuest Panelist\n\n21 episodes\n\n\n2003\n\nThe Importance of Being Famous\n\nPresenter\n\nThree-part documentary\n\n\nTrust Me \u2013 I'm a Politician\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2003\u20132004\n\nTabloid Tales\n\n2 series\n\n\n2003\u20132005\n\nThe Wright Stuff\n\nGuest Presenter\n\n8 episodes\n\n\n2004\u20132005\n\nMorgan and Platell\n\nCo-presenter\n\nWith Amanda Platell\n\n\n2005\n\nDeath of Celebrity\n\nPresenter\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2006\u20132007\n\nYou Can't Fire Me, I'm Famous\n\nChat show\n\n\n2006, 2007, 2020\n\nWho Wants to Be a Millionaire\n\nCelebrity Contestant\n\n3 episodes\n\n\n2006\u20132009\n\nHell's Kitchen\n\nHimself\n\n7 episodes\n\n\n2006\u20132011, 2015\n\nAmerica's Got Talent\n\nJudge\n\nMain judge on Season 1\u20136\nGuest judge on Season 10\n\n\n\n2007\u20132010\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nSeries 1\u20134\n\n\n2007\n\nComic Relief Does The Apprentice\n\nCelebrity Contestant\n\n\n\n\nThe Dame Edna Treatment\n\nHimself\n\nGuest; 1 episode\n\n\nThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno\n\nAlongside David Hasselhoff & Sharon Osbourne\n\n\nRoyal Variety Performance 2007\n\nGuest Announcer\n\nAlongside Simon Cowell & Amanda Holden\n\n\n2008\u20132015\n\nThe Celebrity Apprentice\n\nHimself\n\n21 episodes\n\n\n2008\n\nPiers Morgan on Sandbanks\n\nPresenter\n\nThree-part documentary\n\n\nThe Dark Side of Fame with Piers Morgan\n\n1 series\n\n\nAl Murray's Happy Hour\n\nHimself\n\nGuest; 1 episode\n\n\n2008\u20132016\n\nAnt & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway\n\n5 episodes\n\n\n2009\u20132010\n\nPiers Morgan On...\n\nPresenter\n\n2 series\n\n\n2009\u20132021\n\nPiers Morgan's Life Stories\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\nWhen Piers Met Lord Sugar\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2011\u20132014\n\nPiers Morgan Live\n\nTalk show\n\n\n2012\n\nThe Apprentice: You're Fired!\n\nHimself\n\nSpecial guest; 1 episode\n\n\nThe Talent Show Story\n\n5 episodes\n\n\n2013\n\n2 Broke Girls\n\n1 episode\n\n\n2015\n\nBeing Kevin Pietersen\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2015\u20132019\n\nThis Week\n\nGuest Presenter\n\n8 episodes\n\n\n2015\u20132021\n\nGood Morning Britain\n\nCo-presenter\n\nMonday\u2013Wednesday with Susanna Reid\n\n\n2016\n\nCelebrity Juice\n\nHimself\n\nGuest; 3 episodes\n\n\nSecond Chance\n\nCameo appearance; 1 episode\n\n\nAlan Carr: Chatty Man\n\nGuest; 1 episode\n\n\n21st National Television Awards\n\nPresenter\n\n\n\n\n2016\u20132017\n\nKiller Women with Piers Morgan\n\n7 episodes\n\n\n2017\u20132023\n\nReal Time with Bill Maher\n\nHimself\n\nGuest; 4 episodes\n\n\n2017\u20132018\n\nConfessions of a Serial Killer with Piers Morgan\n\nPresenter\n\n4 episodes\n\n\n2018\n\nPresident Trump \u2013 The Piers Morgan Interview\n\nTelevision special\n\n\nHollyoaks\n\nHimself\n\nCameo appearance; 1 episode\n\n\nPiers, the President and Air Force One\n\nPresenter\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2018\u20132022\n\nTucker Carlson Tonight\n\nGuest Panelist\n\n10 episodes\n\n\n2019\n\nPsychopath with Piers Morgan\n\nPresenter\n\nDocumentary\n\n\nCristiano Ronaldo Meets Piers Morgan\n\nTelevision special\n\n\nSoccer Aid\n\nHimself\n\nAssistant Manager to World XI squad\n\n\nThe Celebrity Chase\n\nContestant; Good Morning Britain Special\n\n\n2021\n\n60 Minutes\n\n1 episode\n\n\n2022\n\nFox & Friends\n\nFox Nation Host\n\n6 episodes\n\n\nGutfeld!\n\nGuest Panelist\n\n2 episodes\n\n\nThe Five\n\nGuest Host\n\n7 episodes\n\n\n2022\u2013present\n\nPiers Morgan Uncensored\n\nPresenter\n\nWeekdays on TalkTV in UK shown on Sky News Australia and Fox Nation in America.\n\nFilm\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2012\n\nFlight\n\nHimself\n\nCameo appearance\n\n\nThe Campaign\n\n\n2013\n\nWorld War Z\n\n\nOne Chance\n\n\n2015\n\nEntourage\n\n\n2016\n\nCriminal\n\n\n2020\n\nThe Accidental President\n\nBibliography\nMorgan, Piers; John Sachs (1991).
