However, based on her comments during a Fox Business\u2019 Varney & Co. interview, Martha MacCallum appears to advocate for stricter border control and an organized immigration process. Regarding abortion, she has criticized Democratically controlled states for allowing abortion seekers to cross state lines for abortions. Finally, she has defended former President Trump\u2019s LGBTQ record I\u2019ve never seen or read or heard anything in President Trump\u2019s dialogue that says that he wants to turn the clock back to a time when Americans were prosecuted for being gay.\u201d These views are evidence of a moderately conservative perspective."
